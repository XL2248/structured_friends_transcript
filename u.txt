s02_e13_c13_u002s04_e20_c01_u001	Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
s04_e20_c01_u002	(joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
s04_e20_c01_u003	Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
s04_e20_c02_u004	Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
s04_e20_c02_u005	You don't need to fill these silences.
s04_e20_c02_u006	Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe.)
s04_e20_c02_u007	Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
s04_e20_c02_u008	Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
s04_e20_c02_u009	He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
s04_e20_c02_u010	(proudly) Oh, you should here me.
s04_e20_c02_u011	It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
s04_e20_c02_u012	Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
s04_e20_c02_u013	They don't have those.
s04_e20_c02_u014	Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
s04_e20_c02_u015	Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over
s04_e20_c02_u016	Ohhh, yeah!
s04_e20_c02_u017	He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
s04_e20_c02_u018	Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
s04_e20_c02_u019	I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
s04_e20_c02_u020	(entering) Hey guys!
s04_e20_c02_u021	Hey, all right!
s04_e20_c02_u022	Hey!
s04_e20_c02_u023	Oh, the Olympics.
s04_e20_c02_u024	Have you guys picked a date yet?
s04_e20_c02_u025	Oh no, not yet.
s04_e20_c02_u026	I still cannot believe you're engaged! (Ross looks at her) Just cause its happening so fast; not cause you're such a loser.
s04_e20_c02_u027	Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
s04_e20_c02_u028	Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!
s04_e20_c02_u029	Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London
s04_e20_c02_u030	Already?!
s04_e20_c02_u031	Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress
s04_e20_c02_u032	I'll pick it up for you!
s04_e20_c02_u033	Thank you.
s04_e20_c02_u034	Okay.
s04_e20_c02_u035	Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses- (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!
s04_e20_c02_u036	What's wah-pah?
s04_e20_c02_u037	Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!
s04_e20_c02_u038	That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
s04_e20_c02_u039	That's what I did. Wah-pah!
s04_e20_c02_u040	You can't do anything!
s04_e20_c03_u041	Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
s04_e20_c03_u042	Hey!
s04_e20_c03_u043	Oh! It's you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.

s04_e20_c03_u046	So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
s04_e20_c03_u047	Oh.
s04_e20_c03_u048	I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda-.. y'know.
s04_e20_c03_u049	Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay.
s04_e20_c03_u050	Yeah?
s04_e20_c03_u051	Yeah.
s04_e20_c03_u052	All right, I just wanted to check.
s04_e20_c03_u053	Oh, that's sweet.
s04_e20_c03_u054	You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
s04_e20_c03_u055	(breaking the hug) Uhh, hang in there?
s04_e20_c03_u056	Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh
s04_e20_c03_u057	I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
s04_e20_c03_u058	Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet.
s04_e20_c03_u059	Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.
s04_e20_c03_u060	Oh. Yeah?

s04_e20_c03_u068	Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?
s04_e20_c03_u069	Oh yeah, no, what's that?
s04_e20_c03_u070	If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
s04_e20_c03_u071	That would be great!
s04_e20_c03_u072	Yeah, all right, it's a date. (He leaves)
s04_e20_c03_u073	(to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the raspberry.)
s04_e20_c03_u074	(coming back in) Did you say something?
s04_e20_c03_u075	No, just singing. (Does a little song.)
s04_e20_c04_u076	Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
s04_e20_c04_u077	Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.

s04_e20_c04_u080	Yes, what's the name, please?
s04_e20_c04_u081	Emily Waltham.
s04_e20_c04_u082	Yes! I have it right here. (Phoebe and Monica both gasp at the dress.) Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
s04_e20_c04_u083	(laughs) Okay.
s04_e20_c04_u084	You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
s04_e20_c04_u085	I am, aren't I?
s04_e20_c04_u086	Ms. Waltham?
s04_e20_c04_u087	Yes?
s04_e20_c04_u088	We're closing.
s04_e20_c04_u089	All right. (Goes to take off the dress.)
s04_e20_c04_u090	And could I get my ring back?
s04_e20_c05_u091	All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
s04_e20_c06_u092	Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)
s04_e20_c06_u093	Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. (There's a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!
s04_e20_c06_u094	No-no, let me in!
s04_e20_c06_u095	Phoebe?
s04_e20_c06_u096	Yeah!
s04_e20_c06_u097	Can you just hold on for one minute?
s04_e20_c06_u098	No, you have to let me in right now!!
s04_e20_c06_u099	Are you alone?
s04_e20_c06_u100	Yes!
s04_e20_c06_u101	All right.
s04_e20_c07_u102	This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
s04_e20_c07_u103	It's 6:00.
s04_e20_c07_u104	Yeah, well
s04_e20_c07_u105	(entering) Hi!
s04_e20_c07_u106	Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.
s04_e20_c07_u107	Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
s04_e20_c07_u108	Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
s04_e20_c07_u109	What?
s04_e20_c07_u110	Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
s04_e20_c07_u111	Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
s04_e20_c07_u112	Why not?
s04_e20_c07_u113	Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this- (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind him and he stops.)
s04_e20_c07_u114	Hey man.
s04_e20_c07_u115	Hey!
s04_e20_c07_u116	So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
s04_e20_c07_u117	Nothing.
s04_e20_c07_u118	Nothing.
s04_e20_c07_u119	I am- (Looks in his date book.) free!
s04_e20_c07_u120	Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
s04_e20_c07_u121	Yep!
s04_e20_c07_u122	In a month?
s04_e20_c07_u123	Yeah!
s04_e20_c07_u124	You mean, you mean 30 days?
s04_e20_c07_u125	Yeah.
s04_e20_c07_u126	From now?
s04_e20_c07_u127	Yeah.
s04_e20_c07_u128	Well, that's great.
s04_e20_c07_u129	Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so- I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
s04_e20_c07_u130	(still looking in date book) Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn't mine.
s04_e20_c08_u131	(entering) Hey, Rachel.
s04_e20_c08_u132	Hi!
s04_e20_c08_u133	What's up? You're voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
s04_e20_c08_u134	Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him) See you.
s04_e20_c08_u135	Great!
s04_e20_c08_u136	Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!
s04_e20_c08_u137	(sitting) You okay?
s04_e20_c08_u138	I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
s04_e20_c08_u139	Do I?
s04_e20_c08_u140	Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?
s04_e20_c08_u141	Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we're-we're-we're-we're-we're clicking.
s04_e20_c08_u142	Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
s04_e20_c08_u143	I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
s04_e20_c08_u144	Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)--I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
s04_e20_c08_u145	What?! (Gunther is listening in.)
s04_e20_c08_u146	Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
s04_e20_c08_u147	Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."
s04_e20_c08_u148	YOU IDIOT!!!!!
s04_e20_c09_u149	Your name, please?
s04_e20_c09_u150	Joey Tribbiani.
s04_e20_c09_u151	Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. (Joey doesn't answer) Uh, sir? (Joey starts snoring)
s04_e20_c09_u152	(answering for him) Yes he did.
s04_e20_c09_u153	Alll right, we'll call you in a few minutes.
s04_e20_c09_u154	(waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
s04_e20_c09_u155	(sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you doin'?
s04_e20_c09_u156	What?!
s04_e20_c09_u157	You're coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.) I'm Chandler.
s04_e20_c09_u158	Hi.
s04_e20_c09_u159	Hi.
s04_e20_c09_u160	You mind if I
s04_e20_c09_u161	No, please.
s04_e20_c09_u162	So uh, what are you in for?
s04_e20_c09_u163	I talk in my sleep.
s04_e20_c09_u164	What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.
s04_e20_c09_u165	(asleep) So why don't you give me your number?
s04_e20_c10_u166	Okay, ready?
s04_e20_c10_u167	Yeah.
s04_e20_c10_u168	Okay.
s04_e20_c10_u169	(catching it) I got it! Mine! (They both hug)
s04_e20_c10_u170	Congratulations!
s04_e20_c10_u171	Thank you!
s04_e20_c10_u172	Okay! My turn! My turn!
s04_e20_c10_u173	Okay! (Gets into position) Okay, ready?
s04_e20_c10_u174	(cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual) Yeah.
s04_e20_c10_u175	Okay. (Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)
s04_e20_c10_u176	(upset) That was a terrible throw!!
s04_e20_c10_u177	I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
s04_e20_c10_u178	Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! (Finally realises) Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
s04_e20_c10_u179	Yeah, I think we are.
s04_e20_c10_u180	This isn't even my dress.
s04_e20_c10_u181	Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
s04_e20_c10_u182	I'm changing out of this.
s04_e20_c10_u183	Me too.
s04_e20_c10_u184	In like a half-hour?
s04_e20_c10_u185	Me too.
s04_e20_c10_u186	Okay, throw it straight this time.
s04_e20_c10_u187	Okay.
s04_e20_c10_u188	I'm getting married next!!
s04_e20_c10_u189	Yay!
s04_e20_c11_u190	I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
s04_e20_c11_u191	Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
s04_e20_c11_u192	I guess.
s04_e20_c11_u193	Oh my God!
s04_e20_c11_u194	Oh God.
s04_e20_c11_u195	Oh, you're such a cheater!
s04_e20_c11_u196	(entering) Hello! Little ones.
s04_e20_c11_u197	Hey!
s04_e20_c11_u198	Hey!
s04_e20_c11_u199	So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
s04_e20_c11_u200	Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They're stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
s04_e20_c11_u201	Oh, how'd that happen?
s04_e20_c11_u202	Because I'm cooler.
s04_e20_c11_u203	No, seriously.
s04_e20_c11_u204	Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
s04_e20_c11_u205	(muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What's happening?
s04_e20_c11_u206	Oh my God!
s04_e20_c11_u207	What is that?
s04_e20_c11_u208	(muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
s04_e20_c11_u209	Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
s04_e20_c11_u210	(takes out the mouth guard) I know I don't have too! It tastes good. (Puts it back in.)
s04_e20_c11_u211	Plus, you look cool.
s04_e20_c12_u212	(entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua
s04_e20_c12_u213	Oh, how did it go?
s04_e20_c12_u214	Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
s04_e20_c12_u215	What did he say?
s04_e20_c12_u216	Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
s04_e20_c12_u217	Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
s04_e20_c12_u218	Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
s04_e20_c12_u219	Yeah, maybe.
s04_e20_c12_u220	And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
s04_e20_c12_u221	Any luck?
s04_e20_c12_u222	Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
s04_e20_c12_u223	Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
s04_e20_c12_u224	(entering) Hey!
s04_e20_c12_u225	Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily's wedding dress into Rachel's room.)
s04_e20_c12_u226	So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
s04_e20_c12_u227	Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
s04_e20_c12_u228	Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
s04_e20_c12_u229	Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
s04_e20_c12_u230	What happened?
s04_e20_c12_u231	Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
s04_e20_c12_u232	Noo. Why?
s04_e20_c12_u233	Well, apparently he scares easy.
s04_e20_c12_u234	Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
s04_e20_c12_u235	It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
s04_e20_c12_u236	Come here.
s04_e20_c12_u237	(breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
s04_e20_c12_u238	Yeah.
s04_e20_c12_u239	Yeah.
s04_e20_c12_u240	You okay?
s04_e20_c12_u241	Yeah! I got my girls.
s04_e20_c12_u242	Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe's lap.)
s04_e20_c12_u243	(looks at Monica) Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
s04_e20_c12_u244	What?
s04_e20_c12_u245	Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
s04_e20_c12_u246	Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause) Maybe someday, there will be.
s04_e20_c12_u247	Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
s04_e20_c12_u248	Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)
s04_e20_c12_u249	No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
s04_e20_c12_u250	No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
s04_e20_c12_u251	I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
s04_e20_c12_u252	Not after this!
s04_e20_c12_u253	Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it's Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the door.)
s04_e20_c12_u254	I gotta go.
s04_e20_c12_u255	Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
s04_e20_c13_u256	(muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to say, "What's up with that?")
s01_e01_c12_u001	Hey, Monica!
s01_e01_c12_u002	Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
s01_e01_c12_u003	You had sex, didn't you?
s01_e01_c12_u004	How do you do that?
s01_e01_c12_u005	You know Paul?
s01_e01_c12_u006	Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
s01_e01_c12_u007	You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
s01_e01_c12_u008	Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
s01_e01_c13_u009	(sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!
s01_e01_c13_u010	Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
s01_e01_c13_u011	I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
s01_e01_c13_u012	All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)
s01_e01_c13_u013	I just thought he was nice, y'know?
s01_e01_c13_u014	(bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
s01_e01_c13_u015	Guess what?
s01_e01_c13_u016	You got a job?
s01_e01_c13_u017	Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
s01_e01_c13_u018	And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
s01_e01_c13_u019	You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
s01_e01_c13_u020	Oh, how well you know me...
s01_e01_c13_u021	They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
s01_e01_c13_u022	How'd you pay for them?
s01_e01_c13_u023	Uh, credit card.
s01_e01_c13_u024	And who pays for that?
s01_e01_c13_u025	Um... my... father.
s01_e01_c14_u026	C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
s01_e01_c14_u027	I know that. That's why I was getting married.
s01_e01_c14_u028	Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
s01_e01_c14_u029	Thank you.
s01_e01_c14_u030	You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
s01_e01_c14_u031	The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
s01_e01_c14_u032	All right, you ready?
s01_e01_c14_u033	I don't think so.
s01_e01_c14_u034	C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
s01_e01_c14_u035	Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)
s01_e01_c14_u036	Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
s01_e01_c14_u037	Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?
s01_e01_c14_u038	No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
s01_e01_c14_u039	You be okay?
s01_e01_c14_u040	Yeah.
s01_e01_c14_u041	Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?
s01_e01_c14_u042	That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
s01_e01_c14_u043	Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-
s01_e01_c14_u044	Sorry-
s01_e01_c14_u045	No no no, go-
s01_e01_c14_u046	No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
s01_e01_c14_u047	Split it?
s01_e01_c14_u048	Okay.
s01_e01_c14_u049	Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
s01_e01_c14_u050	I knew.
s01_e01_c14_u051	You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
s01_e01_c14_u052	I did.
s01_e01_c14_u053	Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
s01_e01_c14_u054	Yeah, maybe...
s01_e01_c14_u055	Okay... okay, maybe I will...
s01_e01_c14_u056	Goodnight.
s01_e01_c14_u057	Goodnight.
s01_e01_c14_u058	See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
s01_e01_c14_u059	I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)
s01_e01_c15_u060	I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
s01_e01_c15_u061	(sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
s01_e01_c15_u062	What? I-I said you had a-
s01_e01_c15_u063	(sings) What I said you had...
s01_e01_c15_u064	(to Phoebe) Would you stop?
s01_e01_c15_u065	Oh, was I doing it again?
s01_e01_c15_u066	(walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?
s01_e01_c15_u067	Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
s01_e01_c15_u068	I'm just serving it.
s01_e01_c15_u069	Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
s01_e01_c15_u070	Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
s01_e01_c15_u071	Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
s08_e10_c01_u001	Hey! So what do you think?
s08_e10_c01_u002	New haircut? (Monica nods No.') Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods Yes.') Boots!
s08_e10_c01_u003	Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots-or rent (Shows him the receipt.)
s08_e10_c01_u004	Oh my God!
s08_e10_c01_u005	I know.
s08_e10_c01_u006	I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
s08_e10_c01_u007	I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."
s08_e10_c01_u008	She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.)
s08_e10_c01_u009	(entering) Hi!
s08_e10_c01_u010	Hey.
s08_e10_c01_u011	Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
s08_e10_c01_u012	They're mine!
s08_e10_c01_u013	Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them.
s08_e10_c01_u014	Return them?! Shh! They're gonna hear you!
s08_e10_c01_u015	Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
s08_e10_c01_u016	I have you.
s08_e10_c01_u017	Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
s08_e10_c02_u018	That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.
s08_e10_c02_u019	How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
s08_e10_c02_u020	(pause) He's talking to the baby.
s08_e10_c02_u021	Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can't wait to hear your first words," I thought, "There's a trick."
s08_e10_c02_u022	Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later.
s08_e10_c02_u023	Okay.
s08_e10_c02_u024	Bye.
s08_e10_c02_u025	Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)
s08_e10_c02_u026	Oh hey Rach, listen-Hi!
s08_e10_c02_u027	Hi.
s08_e10_c02_u028	Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren
s08_e10_c02_u029	No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
s08_e10_c02_u030	No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice.
s08_e10_c02_u031	I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors
s08_e10_c02_u032	Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
s08_e10_c02_u033	Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
s08_e10_c02_u034	Okay, so will you meet with her?
s08_e10_c02_u035	Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
s08_e10_c02_u036	Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?
s08_e10_c02_u037	Yeah.
s08_e10_c02_u038	She took em!
s08_e10_c02_u039	Hey Ross! Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
s08_e10_c02_u040	Yeah. Why?
s08_e10_c02_u041	Sting has a son that goes there too!
s08_e10_c02_u042	Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
s08_e10_c02_u043	You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
s08_e10_c02_u044	Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
s08_e10_c02_u045	Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture.
s08_e10_c02_u046	What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
s08_e10_c02_u047	No, it's New York magazine. It's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
s08_e10_c02_u048	Uh, I actually haven't even met him.
s08_e10_c02_u049	Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you.
s08_e10_c02_u050	Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there.
s08_e10_c02_u051	There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!
s08_e10_c03_u052	Hey guys!
s08_e10_c03_u053	Hey-hey.
s08_e10_c03_u054	Hi Monica!
s08_e10_c03_u055	Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)
s08_e10_c03_u056	Hi boots.
s08_e10_c03_u057	See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants
s08_e10_c03_u058	You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
s08_e10_c03_u059	Wow! They're beautiful!
s08_e10_c03_u060	Ahh
s08_e10_c03_u061	(almost crying) They hurt so much!
s08_e10_c03_u062	What?!
s08_e10_c03_u063	The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
s08_e10_c03_u064	Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!
s08_e10_c03_u065	I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!
s08_e10_c03_u066	Well then get your money back and return them!
s08_e10_c03_u067	I can't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
s08_e10_c03_u068	(entering) Hey!
s08_e10_c03_u069	(returning to his seat) Hey!
s08_e10_c03_u070	Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
s08_e10_c03_u071	(spinning around looking for him) I don't think you did a very thorough job!
s08_e10_c03_u072	I dropped him off at Carol's. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though.
s08_e10_c03_u073	Oh no! Why not?
s08_e10_c03_u074	Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
s08_e10_c03_u075	How come?!
s08_e10_c03_u076	Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims.
s08_e10_c03_u077	Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
s08_e10_c03_u078	Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.
s08_e10_c03_u079	Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
s08_e10_c03_u080	Playpen?! Ben's seven!
s08_e10_c03_u081	Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, "Yes.") (To the rest) He's really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!
s08_e10_c03_u082	Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it.
s08_e10_c03_u083	Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
s08_e10_c03_u084	What?
s08_e10_c03_u085	(singing) Rosssss can!
s08_e10_c03_u086	Look Phoebe, I'm sorry it's just
s08_e10_c03_u087	(singing) Rossss can!
s08_e10_c03_u088	Phoebe, I
s08_e10_c03_u089	(singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
s08_e10_c04_u090	(entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
s08_e10_c04_u091	Oh Joey, I'm hardly a
s08_e10_c04_u092	My little sister Dina!
s08_e10_c04_u093	Right! Hi Dina!
s08_e10_c04_u094	Hi.
s08_e10_c04_u095	Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)
s08_e10_c04_u096	Thanks so much for meetin' with me. Joey's told me so much about you!
s08_e10_c04_u097	This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash-ists get down to business. (Exits.)
s08_e10_c04_u098	Okay. All right Dina, well let's talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let's see, there's design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel
s08_e10_c04_u099	I-I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!
s08_e10_c04_u100	(stunned) And there's marketing
s08_e10_c05_u101	(standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!
s08_e10_c05_u102	(opening the door) What's wrong?
s08_e10_c05_u103	Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning. (Mimics the groan from before and stretches.)
s08_e10_c05_u104	Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go into the apartment.)
s08_e10_c05_u105	Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
s08_e10_c05_u106	Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a-supple leather lining.
s08_e10_c05_u107	I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
s08_e10_c05_u108	Why not?
s08_e10_c05_u109	Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
s08_e10_c05_u110	Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
s08_e10_c05_u111	Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.
s08_e10_c05_u112	You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
s08_e10_c05_u113	Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.
s08_e10_c05_u114	Okay.
s08_e10_c05_u115	Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ow' with laughing.)
s08_e10_c06_u116	I-I can't go in there. I can't tell him!
s08_e10_c06_u117	Honey, it's going to be okay. He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that's what the meatball sub is for. (She gives Dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)
s08_e10_c06_u118	Thank you.
s08_e10_c06_u119	Okay.
s08_e10_c06_u120	Hey! It's my fashion girls! (They don't react.) What's wrong?
s08_e10_c06_u121	Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
s08_e10_c06_u122	(concerned) Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?
s08_e10_c06_u123	Joe, mom and dad are fine
s08_e10_c06_u124	Is that a sandwich?!
s08_e10_c06_u125	Joey-there's something that you-should know. Dina?
s08_e10_c06_u126	I'm pregnant.
s08_e10_c06_u127	(angrily) What?!
s08_e10_c06_u128	(To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)
s08_e10_c06_u129	Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
s08_e10_c06_u130	Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
s08_e10_c06_u131	What?! Dina
s08_e10_c06_u132	(to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
s08_e10_c06_u133	Bobby Corso, but he's a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He's real funny.
s08_e10_c06_u134	You got pregnant for funny?! Dina-if he's funny-laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!
s08_e10_c06_u135	Why? Where are you going?
s08_e10_c06_u136	I can't look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.)
s08_e10_c06_u137	Wow.
s08_e10_c06_u138	I know.
s08_e10_c07_u139	Oh, there you are Ben!
s08_e10_c07_u140	Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
s08_e10_c07_u141	Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.
s08_e10_c07_u142	Jack? I hate him! He's a jerk.
s08_e10_c07_u143	Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
s08_e10_c07_u144	I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there. (Goes over to Doug.)
s08_e10_c07_u145	Him you're friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to find Jack and a teacher notices her.)
s08_e10_c07_u146	Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
s08_e10_c07_u147	Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.
s08_e10_c07_u148	Are you with one of the students?
s08_e10_c07_u149	Uh-huh, I'm with Ben.
s08_e10_c07_u150	Are you one of Ben's mothers?
s08_e10_c07_u151	I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
s08_e10_c07_u152	Well hi, I'm Jenny Boone. I'm the new teacher here.
s08_e10_c07_u153	Oh.
s08_e10_c07_u154	I've only met your partner Carol.
s08_e10_c07_u155	Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
s08_e10_c07_u156	Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents to discuss the problems he's having with Ben? (Phoebe nods Yes.') Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
s08_e10_c07_u157	Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
s08_e10_c07_u158	Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
s08_e10_c07_u159	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
s08_e10_c08_u160	Y'know, that party wasn't bad.
s08_e10_c08_u161	Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
s08_e10_c08_u162	I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
s08_e10_c08_u163	Oh no, we can't walk!
s08_e10_c08_u164	What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.
s08_e10_c08_u165	Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
s08_e10_c08_u166	What's going on?
s08_e10_c08_u167	I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
s08_e10_c08_u168	What?
s08_e10_c08_u169	Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!
s08_e10_c08_u170	So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause) It's oddly unsettling.
s08_e10_c08_u171	How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
s08_e10_c08_u172	Hop on.
s08_e10_c08_u173	Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. (She starts taking them off.) Ah-Ooh-Oohh-Ohh-Oh God-Ohh-Oh-Ohh-Ohhhh
s08_e10_c08_u174	Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.
s08_e10_c09_u175	Do you ever worry that you'll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?
s08_e10_c09_u176	What college was that Dina?
s08_e10_c09_u177	Oh my God! Bobby!
s08_e10_c09_u178	Hi Dina. Good to see you.
s08_e10_c09_u179	Joey, what are you doing?
s08_e10_c09_u180	Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman
s08_e10_c09_u181	Oh Joey this is crazy!
s08_e10_c09_u182	Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man
s08_e10_c09_u183	No!
s08_e10_c09_u184	Oh you'll take em!
s08_e10_c09_u185	No I won't!
s08_e10_c09_u186	Hey! You don't get a say in this!
s08_e10_c09_u187	Yes I do!
s08_e10_c09_u188	Ahhh! I heard "I do", we're halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby) You!
s08_e10_c09_u189	All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby and Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
s08_e10_c09_u190	Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
s08_e10_c09_u191	Well what am I supposed to do?
s08_e10_c09_u192	You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
s08_e10_c09_u193	No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
s08_e10_c09_u194	Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina) Right?
s08_e10_c09_u195	Yeah-we kinda didn't use any
s08_e10_c09_u196	Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
s08_e10_c10_u197	Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting's pen-that he gave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase) Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)
s08_e10_c10_u198	Hi! (By the way, it's actually her.)
s08_e10_c10_u199	Hi!
s08_e10_c10_u200	I'm Trudie.
s08_e10_c10_u201	Uh-huh.
s08_e10_c10_u202	You must be Ben's mum.
s08_e10_c10_u203	Why else would I be here?
s08_e10_c10_u204	Do sit down.
s08_e10_c10_u205	Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)
s08_e10_c10_u206	I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
s08_e10_c10_u207	Yeah.
s08_e10_c10_u208	I'm told there are two sides to this story, but all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a poo-poo head.
s08_e10_c10_u209	Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?
s08_e10_c10_u210	Oh I'm sorry, Jack's father is not available.
s08_e10_c10_u211	Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?
s08_e10_c10_u212	Oh no, I know that wouldn't work. My husband's in concert.
s08_e10_c10_u213	Concert. Yeah. That does put us in-quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.
s08_e10_c10_u214	So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
s08_e10_c10_u215	Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
s08_e10_c10_u216	Are you here for tickets?
s08_e10_c10_u217	Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
s08_e10_c10_u218	I'm not giving concert tickets to someone who'd use their son like this!
s08_e10_c10_u219	Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!
s08_e10_c10_u220	(stands up) Look, I've just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
s08_e10_c10_u221	The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)
s08_e10_c11_u222	Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
s08_e10_c11_u223	(notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
s08_e10_c11_u224	Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
s08_e10_c11_u225	My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
s08_e10_c11_u226	I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
s08_e10_c11_u227	Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
s08_e10_c11_u228	(pause) I don't have your boots.
s08_e10_c11_u229	Well I don't have them either. Where are they?
s08_e10_c11_u230	Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
s08_e10_c11_u231	Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!
s08_e10_c11_u232	Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
s08_e10_c11_u233	Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
s08_e10_c11_u234	Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
s08_e10_c11_u235	Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.
s08_e10_c11_u236	Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)
s08_e10_c11_u237	(to the boots) Bye boots-Wait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.)
s08_e10_c12_u238	Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
s08_e10_c12_u239	Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
s08_e10_c12_u240	Well-I really have high hopes for my band.
s08_e10_c12_u241	(to Dina) You were right. He is funny.
s08_e10_c12_u242	Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?
s08_e10_c12_u243	Well it's just me and my pal Rooster, the band's name is Numb Nuts.
s08_e10_c12_u244	(To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)
s08_e10_c12_u245	Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, that's not a compliment!
s08_e10_c12_u246	No Joey! I knew you wouldn't be supportive!
s08_e10_c12_u247	So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself-without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
s08_e10_c12_u248	Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
s08_e10_c12_u249	No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
s08_e10_c12_u250	Excuse me?
s08_e10_c12_u251	One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
s08_e10_c12_u252	So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
s08_e10_c12_u253	Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Well-so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!
s08_e10_c12_u254	Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I'm just gonna need some help. And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
s08_e10_c12_u255	You bet I am! (To Joey) And to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap. (Joey shakes his head as if he's about to lose it.)
s08_e10_c12_u256	Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?
s08_e10_c12_u257	Because! Cause- Cause you're my baby sister!
s08_e10_c12_u258	And you're my big brother! I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world. I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.
s08_e10_c12_u259	Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.
s08_e10_c12_u260	Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
s08_e10_c12_u261	Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
s08_e10_c12_u262	We're gonna be all right. I mean, even if we're not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
s08_e10_c12_u263	That's right! By his uncle too!
s08_e10_c12_u264	And by you.
s08_e10_c12_u265	Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)
s08_e10_c12_u266	Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)
s08_e10_c12_u267	No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
s08_e10_c13_u268	You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)
s08_e10_c13_u269	Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
s08_e10_c13_u270	Well-let's just say- (singing) Rosss caaaaan!
s08_e10_c13_u271	Oo, where are the seats?
s08_e10_c13_u272	Uh, middle balcony.
s08_e10_c13_u273	Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
s08_e10_c13_u274	Yeah.
s08_e10_c13_u275	Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!
s04_e07_c01_u001	(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
s04_e07_c01_u002	Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
s04_e07_c01_u003	It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth! (leaves)
s04_e07_c01_u004	Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
s04_e07_c01_u005	Yeah! Oh my God!
s04_e07_c02_u006	Here you go.
s04_e07_c02_u007	Great! All right, so I'll call you later.
s04_e07_c02_u008	Great! (leaves)
s04_e07_c02_u009	(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
s04_e07_c02_u010	That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
s04_e07_c02_u011	Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
s04_e07_c02_u012	No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
s04_e07_c02_u013	(shocked) What?
s04_e07_c02_u014	Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)
s04_e07_c02_u015	Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
s04_e07_c02_u016	Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
s04_e07_c02_u017	Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can't believe he just sad that.)
s04_e07_c02_u018	What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
s04_e07_c02_u019	Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.
s04_e07_c02_u020	You got all that from the back of her head?
s04_e07_c02_u021	All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
s04_e07_c02_u022	Who's Elaine?
s04_e07_c03_u023	(singing) "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease-" Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse.
s04_e07_c03_u024	Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease- (plays air guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
s04_e07_c03_u025	Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
s04_e07_c03_u026	Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
s04_e07_c03_u027	Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
s04_e07_c03_u028	Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
s04_e07_c03_u029	Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
s04_e07_c03_u030	Yeah.
s04_e07_c03_u031	He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
s04_e07_c03_u032	I wanna hear "The Sound."
s04_e07_c03_u033	Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
s04_e07_c03_u034	Come on, play that funky music white boy.
s04_e07_c03_u035	Yeah!
s04_e07_c03_u036	No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay. (Runs out.)
s04_e07_c03_u037	Okay, guys.
s04_e07_c03_u038	All right! Bring it on, you
s04_e07_c03_u039	Here we go. (Plays one note) Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm
s04_e07_c03_u040	(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
s04_e07_c03_u041	(At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm- terrific.
s04_e07_c03_u042	Really, bitchin'!
s04_e07_c03_u043	Wow, it was so-wow!
s04_e07_c03_u044	Really?! I mean, really?!!
s04_e07_c03_u045	Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
s04_e07_c03_u046	Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I'm-I am so- (starts to break up and leaves)
s04_e07_c03_u047	Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
s04_e07_c03_u048	Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
s04_e07_c03_u049	What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
s04_e07_c03_u050	You mean like, music?
s04_e07_c04_u051	Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
s04_e07_c04_u052	Come in!
s04_e07_c04_u053	(entering) Hey! (sees what's on TV) Oh God, is that Baywatch?
s04_e07_c04_u054	Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
s04_e07_c04_u055	So is Joey around?
s04_e07_c04_u056	No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
s04_e07_c04_u057	I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
s04_e07_c04_u058	I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) -of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.
s04_e07_c04_u059	(on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
s04_e07_c04_u060	What happened?
s04_e07_c04_u061	We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can.
s04_e07_c04_u062	Why can't you tell her?
s04_e07_c04_u063	Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-(he stops talking suddenly)
s04_e07_c04_u064	Joey! Joey!!
s04_e07_c04_u065	Yeah?
s04_e07_c04_u066	I thought your time ran out.
s04_e07_c04_u067	Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-(his time runs out for real)
s04_e07_c04_u068	(to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
s04_e07_c04_u069	Oh.
s04_e07_c04_u070	So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
s04_e07_c04_u071	Oh, okay.
s04_e07_c04_u072	Yeah, I think it is!
s04_e07_c04_u073	So what did you do today?
s04_e07_c04_u074	Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut
s04_e07_c04_u075	(interrupting) Oh, it looks great!
s04_e07_c04_u076	and then it got canceled.
s04_e07_c04_u077	Well, I could cut it.
s04_e07_c04_u078	Really?! You do that?
s04_e07_c04_u079	Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
s04_e07_c04_u080	Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
s04_e07_c04_u081	You have really great hair.
s04_e07_c04_u082	Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
s04_e07_c04_u083	Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
s04_e07_c04_u084	What-what cha doin'?
s04_e07_c04_u085	Checking to see if it's even.
s04_e07_c04_u086	Kay.
s04_e07_c04_u087	Looks good.
s04_e07_c04_u088	(jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! (On phone) Hello!
s04_e07_c04_u089	(on phone) Hey dude, it's me.
s04_e07_c04_u090	Hey it's Joey!
s04_e07_c04_u091	Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!
s04_e07_c04_u092	What?
s04_e07_c04_u093	Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
s04_e07_c04_u094	Okay.
s04_e07_c04_u095	Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
s04_e07_c04_u096	Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
s04_e07_c04_u097	(on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no it's fine, don't worry about it. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay. (listens) Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably go.
s04_e07_c04_u098	Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
s04_e07_c04_u099	I forgot my purse.
s04_e07_c04_u100	Oh.
s04_e07_c04_u101	No, I really did forget my purse.
s04_e07_c05_u102	No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
s04_e07_c05_u103	Horrible!
s04_e07_c05_u104	Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
s04_e07_c05_u105	No-no-no, the kiss was good.
s04_e07_c05_u106	Okay!
s04_e07_c05_u107	No, but that's bad!
s04_e07_c05_u108	Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened.
s04_e07_c05_u109	What?!
s04_e07_c05_u110	Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
s04_e07_c05_u111	Can you really do that?
s04_e07_c05_u112	I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him.
s04_e07_c05_u113	Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you
s04_e07_c05_u114	(interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn.
s04_e07_c05_u115	I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
s04_e07_c05_u116	I-I think we have too.
s04_e07_c05_u117	Okay. Bye.
s04_e07_c05_u118	Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?
s04_e07_c05_u119	(outside the door) No. (Chandler opens the door and they kiss again.)
s04_e07_c06_u120	(His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time
s04_e07_c06_u121	(to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
s04_e07_c06_u122	(pushing Monica back onto the couch) It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
s04_e07_c06_u123	(with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys
s04_e07_c06_u124	(to Phoebe) Hey, aren't you up next?
s04_e07_c06_u125	Oh no, I'm not playing tonight.
s04_e07_c06_u126	Why not?
s04_e07_c06_u127	I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
s04_e07_c06_u128	Phoebe, Ross sucks!
s04_e07_c06_u129	Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
s04_e07_c06_u130	Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
s04_e07_c06_u131	Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
s04_e07_c06_u132	Yeah, Phoebe you're- awful!
s04_e07_c06_u133	You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)
s04_e07_c07_u134	Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.)
s04_e07_c07_u135	Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
s04_e07_c07_u136	(rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
s04_e07_c07_u137	I sure did.
s04_e07_c07_u138	Why?
s04_e07_c07_u139	Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
s04_e07_c07_u140	Well, you're amazing.
s04_e07_c07_u141	Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)
s04_e07_c07_u142	(very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
s04_e07_c07_u143	Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
s04_e07_c07_u144	Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
s04_e07_c07_u145	Oh, I don't know.
s04_e07_c07_u146	Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that.
s04_e07_c07_u147	You mean with Casey.
s04_e07_c07_u148	No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
s04_e07_c07_u149	Or Casey.
s04_e07_c07_u150	No-no, Kathy.
s04_e07_c07_u151	Could be Casey.
s04_e07_c07_u152	No. No, Kathy.
s04_e07_c07_u153	Consider Casey.
s04_e07_c07_u154	Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
s04_e07_c07_u155	That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
s04_e07_c08_u156	(to Phoebe) Hey!
s04_e07_c08_u157	Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
s04_e07_c08_u158	Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
s04_e07_c08_u159	Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
s04_e07_c08_u160	Pheebs
s04_e07_c08_u161	Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I
s04_e07_c08_u162	See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I- I won't play anymore.
s04_e07_c08_u163	Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
s04_e07_c08_u164	Yeah, okay.
s04_e07_c09_u165	Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
s04_e07_c09_u166	Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
s04_e07_c09_u167	I kissed Kathy.
s04_e07_c09_u168	What?
s04_e07_c09_u169	Are you serious?
s04_e07_c09_u170	Does Joey know?
s04_e07_c09_u171	No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
s04_e07_c09_u172	You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.
s04_e07_c09_u173	No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
s04_e07_c09_u174	Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
s04_e07_c09_u175	I think maybe, yeah.
s04_e07_c09_u176	He loves you.
s04_e07_c09_u177	Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
s04_e07_c09_u178	Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
s04_e07_c09_u179	Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
s04_e07_c09_u180	I know, I remember that!
s04_e07_c09_u181	I remember you did.
s04_e07_c09_u182	God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
s04_e07_c09_u183	Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
s04_e07_c09_u184	Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
s04_e07_c09_u185	Because you do.
s04_e07_c09_u186	Yeah, I know.
s04_e07_c09_u187	Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
s04_e07_c10_u188	Hey!
s04_e07_c10_u189	Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
s04_e07_c10_u190	Is that a real thing?
s04_e07_c10_u191	Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
s04_e07_c10_u192	Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
s04_e07_c10_u193	What's up?
s04_e07_c10_u194	It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
s04_e07_c10_u195	You do?
s04_e07_c10_u196	Yeah.
s04_e07_c10_u197	Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore.
s04_e07_c10_u198	What?
s04_e07_c10_u199	Yeah, she broke up with me.
s04_e07_c10_u200	Oh uh, when?
s04_e07_c10_u201	Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
s04_e07_c10_u202	Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
s04_e07_c10_u203	Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
s04_e07_c10_u204	Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
s04_e07_c10_u205	No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
s04_e07_c10_u206	Yeah?
s04_e07_c10_u207	Yeah. You know why? Cause you came to me first.
s04_e07_c10_u208	Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
s04_e07_c10_u209	But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So
s04_e07_c10_u210	See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
s04_e07_c10_u211	Who?
s04_e07_c10_u212	It's me. I'm the other guy.
s04_e07_c10_u213	What?
s04_e07_c10_u214	Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and
s04_e07_c10_u215	And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
s04_e07_c10_u216	No! No! No! I just kissed her.
s04_e07_c10_u217	What?!! That's even worse!!
s04_e07_c10_u218	How is that worse?!
s04_e07_c10_u219	I don't know! But it's the same!
s04_e07_c10_u220	Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
s04_e07_c10_u221	Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
s04_e07_c10_u222	You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
s04_e07_c10_u223	Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
s04_e07_c10_u224	Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
s04_e07_c10_u225	Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like "Well, kinda.") Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
s04_e07_c10_u226	Probably because
s04_e07_c10_u227	Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. (The bread maker dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)
s04_e07_c11_u228	Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
s04_e07_c11_u229	(removing ear plugs) What?
s04_e07_c11_u230	Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
s04_e07_c11_u231	Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my set?
s04_e07_c11_u232	After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
s04_e07_c11_u233	Yeah, like I could lose it.
s04_e07_c11_u234	What?
s04_e07_c11_u235	I played bad on purpose guys.
s04_e07_c11_u236	Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
s04_e07_c11_u237	Yeah-no, just that last song.
s01_e23_c01_u001	She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
s01_e23_c01_u002	I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
s01_e23_c01_u003	I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
s01_e23_c01_u004	Do we have to know about that?
s01_e23_c01_u005	Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
s01_e23_c01_u006	I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
s01_e23_c01_u007	Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
s01_e23_c01_u008	God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
s01_e23_c01_u009	Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
s01_e23_c01_u010	What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
s01_e23_c01_u011	You have to pick your moments.
s01_e23_c01_u012	Did I miss it, did I miss it?
s01_e23_c01_u013	She's not even here yet.
s01_e23_c01_u014	What's with the guitar?
s01_e23_c01_u015	I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.
s01_e23_c01_u016	(to Carol) Where the hell have you been?
s01_e23_c01_u017	We stopped at the gift shop.
s01_e23_c01_u018	I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.
s01_e23_c01_u019	Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
s01_e23_c01_u020	I used to have that bumper sticker.
s01_e23_c01_u021	(to Rachel) You see what I mean.
s01_e23_c02_u022	Stopped for a Chunky.
s01_e23_c02_u023	Let it go, Ross.
s01_e23_c02_u024	I got an extra one. You want this? (holds the candy in front of Ross' face)
s01_e23_c02_u025	(weakly) No.
s01_e23_c02_u026	Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
s01_e23_c02_u027	Dr. Franzblau, hi.
s01_e23_c02_u028	So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
s01_e23_c02_u029	Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.
s01_e23_c02_u030	They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
s01_e23_c02_u031	59 seconds. (holds up his watch) Quartz, ha.
s01_e23_c02_u032	Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
s01_e23_c02_u033	Am I allowed to drink anything?
s01_e23_c02_u034	Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station.
s01_e23_c02_u035	I'll get it.
s01_e23_c02_u036	No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
s01_e23_c02_u037	I got it-I'm getting it!
s01_e23_c02_u038	Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
s01_e23_c02_u039	Thanks.
s01_e23_c02_u040	And if you need anything else, I-(notices the handsome Dr. Franzblau)-do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
s01_e23_c02_u041	It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
s01_e23_c02_u042	Oh, that's funny!
s01_e23_c03_u043	I want a baby.
s01_e23_c03_u044	Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
s01_e23_c03_u045	Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
s01_e23_c03_u046	Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
s01_e23_c03_u047	(to the screen) Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.
s01_e23_c03_u048	Knick fan?
s01_e23_c03_u049	Oh, yeah.
s01_e23_c03_u050	Oh, boy, do they suck.
s01_e23_c03_u051	Hey, listen, lady....(sees that she's pregnant)...whoa.
s01_e23_c03_u052	Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.
s01_e23_c03_u053	Oh yeah? And who do you like?
s01_e23_c03_u054	The Celtics.
s01_e23_c03_u055	The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
s01_e23_c03_u056	Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!
s01_e23_c03_u057	Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
s01_e23_c03_u058	There is no father.
s01_e23_c03_u059	Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
s01_e23_c03_u060	Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!
s01_e23_c03_u061	Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
s01_e23_c03_u062	Ok.
s01_e23_c04_u063	(singing)
s01_e23_c04_u064	Thanks, Ross.
s01_e23_c04_u065	Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
s01_e23_c04_u066	Ok.
s01_e23_c04_u067	Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
s01_e23_c04_u068	No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
s01_e23_c04_u069	You'll get one.
s01_e23_c04_u070	Oh yeah? When?
s01_e23_c04_u071	All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
s01_e23_c04_u072	Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
s01_e23_c04_u073	Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
s01_e23_c04_u074	Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
s01_e23_c04_u075	No, no, no.
s01_e23_c04_u076	What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
s01_e23_c04_u077	(trapped) Uh, uh.
s01_e23_c04_u078	Well?
s01_e23_c04_u079	Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
s01_e23_c04_u080	Hey.
s01_e23_c04_u081	Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
s01_e23_c04_u082	Did you go home and change?
s01_e23_c04_u083	Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
s01_e23_c04_u084	No, I haven't seen him.
s01_e23_c04_u085	Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby needs him?
s01_e23_c04_u086	Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
s01_e23_c04_u087	Yeah, why?
s01_e23_c04_u088	No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)
s01_e23_c05_u089	Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. (pause) What do you mean, Joey who? (covers the phone, to Joey) Joey who?
s01_e23_c05_u090	Tribbiani.
s01_e23_c05_u091	Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. (to Joey) She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.
s01_e23_c05_u092	(takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're just friends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?
s01_e23_c05_u093	She's not much of a phone person.
s01_e23_c05_u094	Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
s01_e23_c05_u095	Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.
s01_e23_c05_u096	Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
s01_e23_c05_u097	Maybe you should.
s01_e23_c05_u098	Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
s01_e23_c05_u099	You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
s01_e23_c05_u100	Oh, that is so not true.
s01_e23_c05_u101	Oh, it is.
s01_e23_c05_u102	It isn't.
s01_e23_c05_u103	It is.
s01_e23_c05_u104	Isn't!
s01_e23_c06_u105	Breathe.
s01_e23_c06_u106	Breathe.
s01_e23_c06_u107	Breathe.
s01_e23_c06_u108	Breathe.
s01_e23_c06_u109	Breathe.
s01_e23_c06_u110	Breathe.
s01_e23_c06_u111	You're gonna kill me!
s01_e23_c06_u112	15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
s01_e23_c06_u113	Count faster.
s01_e23_c06_u114	It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie.
s01_e23_c06_u115	Who the hell is Jordie?
s01_e23_c06_u116	Your son.
s01_e23_c06_u117	No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
s01_e23_c06_u118	Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
s01_e23_c06_u119	What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
s01_e23_c06_u120	Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
s01_e23_c06_u121	I got it.
s01_e23_c06_u122	I got it.
s01_e23_c06_u123	I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
s01_e23_c06_u124	No, you don't.
s01_e23_c06_u125	All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
s01_e23_c06_u126	Why?
s01_e23_c06_u127	He started it!
s01_e23_c06_u128	No, you started it.
s01_e23_c06_u129	You did!
s01_e23_c06_u130	I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
s01_e23_c06_u131	But...
s01_e23_c06_u132	Now go!
s01_e23_c06_u133	(to Susan) Thanks a lot.
s01_e23_c06_u134	(to Ross) See what you did.
s01_e23_c06_u135	(to Carol) Yeah, listen...
s01_e23_c06_u136	Out!
s01_e23_c07_u137	Breathe, breathe, breathe...
s01_e23_c07_u138	Oh, no.
s01_e23_c07_u139	Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
s01_e23_c07_u140	It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
s01_e23_c07_u141	(panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
s01_e23_c07_u142	(to Joey) Breathe, breathe, breathe.
s01_e23_c08_u143	Please. This is so your fault.
s01_e23_c08_u144	How, how is this my fault?
s01_e23_c08_u145	Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
s01_e23_c08_u146	Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
s01_e23_c08_u147	You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
s01_e23_c08_u148	You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
s01_e23_c08_u149	Oh, I'm threatened by you?
s01_e23_c08_u150	Yes.
s01_e23_c08_u151	Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
s01_e23_c08_u152	Yeah, Susan.
s01_e23_c08_u153	Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
s01_e23_c08_u154	Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
s01_e23_c09_u155	Help!
s01_e23_c09_u156	I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as if he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow.
s01_e23_c10_u157	Are they here yet?
s01_e23_c10_u158	No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
s01_e23_c10_u159	Ok.
s01_e23_c10_u160	Ok?
s01_e23_c10_u161	Ok.
s01_e23_c10_u162	(to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
s01_e23_c10_u163	It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. (Carol sits up in pain, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau casually lay her back down) There you go, dear.
s01_e23_c11_u164	Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's- (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I was just-yeah, right. Push! Push!
s01_e23_c12_u165	What're you gonna do, suck the door open?
s01_e23_c12_u166	Help! Help!
s01_e23_c12_u167	(singing) They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next...(sees Ross and Susan staring at her) la la la la la la.
s01_e23_c12_u168	(even louder) Help!
s01_e23_c13_u169	Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance? (Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
s01_e23_c13_u170	Where have you been?
s01_e23_c13_u171	Oh, just had a baby.
s01_e23_c13_u172	Mazel tov!
s01_e23_c14_u173	I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?
s01_e23_c14_u174	(anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
s01_e23_c14_u175	No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.
s01_e23_c14_u176	Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
s01_e23_c14_u177	No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.
s01_e23_c14_u178	Oh.
s01_e23_c14_u179	I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?
s01_e23_c14_u180	I'm a waitress.
s01_e23_c14_u181	Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...
s01_e23_c14_u182	(getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha.
s01_e23_c14_u183	I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
s01_e23_c14_u184	Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)
s01_e23_c15_u185	So how did you know I was even here?
s01_e23_c15_u186	Your mom called me. So is this her?
s01_e23_c15_u187	No, this is a loaner.
s01_e23_c15_u188	I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
s01_e23_c15_u189	I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. (Joey smiles) So, did you see who won the game?
s01_e23_c15_u190	Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
s01_e23_c15_u191	Yeah, they're not so bad.
s01_e23_c16_u192	Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
s01_e23_c16_u193	The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
s01_e23_c16_u194	No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
s01_e23_c16_u195	You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
s01_e23_c16_u196	Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
s01_e23_c16_u197	This is so great.
s01_e23_c16_u198	You wanna explain that?
s01_e23_c16_u199	I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'm sorry, you were fighting.
s01_e23_c17_u200	Where are they?
s01_e23_c17_u201	I'm sure they'll be here soon.
s01_e23_c17_u202	Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
s01_e23_c17_u203	Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
s01_e23_c17_u204	(to Joey) You are really frightening me.
s01_e23_c17_u205	Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
s01_e23_c17_u206	All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
s01_e23_c17_u207	All right, honey, time to start pushing.
s01_e23_c17_u208	But they're not here yet!
s01_e23_c17_u209	I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
s01_e23_c17_u210	Oh, god.
s01_e23_c18_u211	Ok, got the vent open.
s01_e23_c18_u212	(reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
s01_e23_c18_u213	Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.
s01_e23_c18_u214	What do you see?
s01_e23_c18_u215	Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
s01_e23_c18_u216	Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
s01_e23_c18_u217	(to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs!
s01_e23_c19_u218	Push, push!
s01_e23_c19_u219	We're here!
s01_e23_c19_u220	(irked) Where have you been?
s01_e23_c19_u221	Long story, honey.
s01_e23_c19_u222	All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need-(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I have this?
s01_e23_c19_u223	All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
s01_e23_c19_u224	Good luck!
s01_e23_c19_u225	(to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
s01_e23_c19_u226	Out!
s01_e23_c19_u227	All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
s01_e23_c19_u228	Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
s01_e23_c19_u229	(straining) Not.... helping!
s01_e23_c19_u230	You're doing great, you're doing fine.
s01_e23_c19_u231	(puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry.
s01_e23_c19_u232	What do you see? What do you see?
s01_e23_c19_u233	We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
s01_e23_c19_u234	Oh, look at that.
s01_e23_c19_u235	What does he look like?
s01_e23_c19_u236	Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.
s01_e23_c19_u237	Really?
s01_e23_c19_u238	(from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!
s01_e23_c19_u239	Oh, thanks, Pheebs!
s01_e23_c20_u240	No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.
s01_e23_c20_u241	(thinking) How 'bout Ben?
s01_e23_c20_u242	I like Ben.
s01_e23_c20_u243	Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
s01_e23_c20_u244	We uh, we just cooked it up.
s01_e23_c20_u245	That's what we were off doing.
s01_e23_c20_u246	Hi.
s01_e23_c20_u247	Hey.
s01_e23_c20_u248	Can we come in?
s01_e23_c20_u249	(to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
s01_e23_c20_u250	Susan, he looks just like you.
s01_e23_c20_u251	Thanks.
s01_e23_c20_u252	Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
s01_e23_c20_u253	I know, I still am one of these.
s01_e23_c20_u254	Ross, can I?
s01_e23_c20_u255	The head, the head. You gotta...
s01_e23_c20_u256	(getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
s01_e23_c21_u257	Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns)
s01_e23_c21_u258	And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)
s01_e23_c21_u259	He is so amazing.
s01_e23_c21_u260	Oh, I know. Look at him.
s01_e23_c21_u261	Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
s01_e23_c21_u262	Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he's opening his eyes. (picture comes back)
s01_e23_c21_u263	He doesn't do much, does he?
s01_e23_c21_u264	No, this is pretty much it.
s01_e23_c21_u265	You guys wanna get some coffee?
s01_e23_c21_u266	Yeah.
s01_e23_c21_u267	All right, I'll see you guys later.
s01_e23_c21_u268	Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
s07_e02_c01_u001	Hey!
s07_e02_c01_u002	Hi!
s07_e02_c01_u003	Who wants French toast?
s07_e02_c01_u004	Oh, I'll have some!
s07_e02_c01_u005	Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
s07_e02_c01_u006	(entering from her room) Oww!
s07_e02_c01_u007	What's the matter honey?
s07_e02_c01_u008	I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?
s07_e02_c01_u009	It starts?
s07_e02_c01_u010	Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
s07_e02_c01_u011	Okay! (Runs off.)
s07_e02_c01_u012	(incredulous) Already?!
s07_e02_c01_u013	Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music
s07_e02_c01_u014	Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
s07_e02_c01_u015	Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks
s07_e02_c01_u016	Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
s07_e02_c01_u017	(returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)
s07_e02_c01_u018	What in God's name is that?!
s07_e02_c01_u019	Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
s07_e02_c01_u020	This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. (She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
s07_e02_c01_u021	That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it off now.
s07_e02_c02_u022	And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at- (Phoebe rushes in.)
s07_e02_c02_u023	Hey! Ross!
s07_e02_c02_u024	Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
s07_e02_c02_u025	I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
s07_e02_c02_u026	Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you- (Motions that they should learn everyone's hometown.) (To Phoebe) Wh-what's going on?
s07_e02_c02_u027	Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
s07_e02_c02_u028	Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
s07_e02_c02_u029	Nothing-Why?!
s07_e02_c02_u030	Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
s07_e02_c02_u031	Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
s07_e02_c02_u032	Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
s07_e02_c02_u033	(to the students) Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
s07_e02_c03_u034	All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
s07_e02_c03_u035	Okay.
s07_e02_c03_u036	All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
s07_e02_c03_u037	Aw.
s07_e02_c03_u038	A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
s07_e02_c03_u039	Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick- (Off of Rachel and Monica's looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
s07_e02_c03_u040	(sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.) Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
s07_e02_c03_u041	Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
s07_e02_c03_u042	Well, the duck
s07_e02_c03_u043	What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
s07_e02_c03_u044	Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
s07_e02_c03_u045	Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
s07_e02_c03_u046	Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
s07_e02_c03_u047	Okay.
s07_e02_c03_u048	Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
s07_e02_c03_u049	Centerpieces!
s07_e02_c03_u050	Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)
s07_e02_c03_u051	Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.
s07_e02_c03_u052	Oh my God! It's like one mind.
s07_e02_c03_u053	Uh-huh!
s07_e02_c03_u054	(sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
s07_e02_c03_u055	Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
s07_e02_c03_u056	Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
s07_e02_c03_u057	What?!
s07_e02_c03_u058	All right, I'm gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)
s07_e02_c03_u059	Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
s07_e02_c03_u060	I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
s07_e02_c03_u061	Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream? (He's about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachel's room. He walks into her room and feels the bed.) That's so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.) Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.) (In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar-(Stops reading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) -wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his-(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! (Continues to read.)
s07_e02_c04_u062	Uh, Phoebe
s07_e02_c04_u063	Oh Ross, hi.
s07_e02_c04_u064	Phoebe, what are you doing?
s07_e02_c04_u065	I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
s07_e02_c04_u066	Phoebe!
s07_e02_c04_u067	Okay, let's talk outside.
s07_e02_c04_u068	Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
s07_e02_c04_u069	What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
s07_e02_c04_u070	And they knew about it?
s07_e02_c04_u071	(pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
s07_e02_c04_u072	Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
s07_e02_c04_u073	Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
s07_e02_c04_u074	The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
s07_e02_c05_u075	Hey Joey, what cha doing?
s07_e02_c05_u076	Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
s07_e02_c05_u077	No.
s07_e02_c05_u078	Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
s07_e02_c05_u079	Joey, did you my face cream?
s07_e02_c05_u080	Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
s07_e02_c05_u081	Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?
s07_e02_c05_u082	Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?
s07_e02_c05_u083	(gasps) You found my book?!
s07_e02_c05_u084	Yeah I did!
s07_e02_c05_u085	Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
s07_e02_c05_u086	Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
s07_e02_c05_u087	Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little-erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)
s07_e02_c05_u088	You got porn!
s07_e02_c06_u089	Hello.
s07_e02_c06_u090	Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
s07_e02_c06_u091	Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
s07_e02_c06_u092	Ohh great.
s07_e02_c06_u093	Can I, can I help you with something?
s07_e02_c06_u094	Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
s07_e02_c06_u095	(deadpan) Yes I am.
s07_e02_c06_u096	Great! (Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.)
s07_e02_c07_u097	So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
s07_e02_c07_u098	Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
s07_e02_c07_u099	I remember when we first got engaged.
s07_e02_c07_u100	Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
s07_e02_c07_u101	Oh dad, really you don't need to
s07_e02_c07_u102	(ignoring her) Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
s07_e02_c07_u103	(incredulous) You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
s07_e02_c07_u104	What a sweet story.
s07_e02_c07_u105	Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
s07_e02_c07_u106	What?! They wanted a scary story!
s07_e02_c07_u107	Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. (Chandler and her laugh, but her parents don't.) What?
s07_e02_c07_u108	You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
s07_e02_c07_u109	What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
s07_e02_c07_u110	We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
s07_e02_c08_u111	I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
s07_e02_c08_u112	We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
s07_e02_c08_u113	You bought the beach house when I was 23!
s07_e02_c08_u114	Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
s07_e02_c08_u115	We really do feel bad about this though.
s07_e02_c08_u116	We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
s07_e02_c08_u117	What about when I started dating Chandler?
s07_e02_c08_u118	Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
s07_e02_c08_u119	Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
s07_e02_c08_u120	I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
s07_e02_c08_u121	We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
s07_e02_c08_u122	It seemed like such a simple idea.
s07_e02_c08_u123	Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
s07_e02_c08_u124	All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! (Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)
s07_e02_c09_u125	Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh, that's soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)
s07_e02_c10_u126	I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
s07_e02_c10_u127	I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.
s07_e02_c10_u128	Well what happened at dinner?
s07_e02_c10_u129	My parents spent the money for our wedding!
s07_e02_c10_u130	(gasps) My God! What did you order?!
s07_e02_c10_u131	Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
s07_e02_c10_u132	Honey, it's gonna be okay.
s07_e02_c10_u133	No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
s07_e02_c10_u134	No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)
s07_e02_c10_u135	Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
s07_e02_c10_u136	Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
s07_e02_c10_u137	Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
s07_e02_c10_u138	How? I don't have any money.
s07_e02_c10_u139	Well, I have some.
s07_e02_c10_u140	How much?
s07_e02_c10_u141	Well, close to- (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)
s07_e02_c10_u142	Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
s07_e02_c10_u143	Well what?! How-how much is it?!
s07_e02_c10_u144	It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
s07_e02_c10_u145	Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!
s07_e02_c10_u146	(To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
s07_e02_c10_u147	(starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
s07_e02_c10_u148	Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
s07_e02_c10_u149	Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
s07_e02_c10_u150	(reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr. Chandler.
s07_e02_c10_u151	This is the most special day of our lives.
s07_e02_c10_u152	No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
s07_e02_c10_u153	Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
s07_e02_c10_u154	Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
s07_e02_c10_u155	You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
s07_e02_c10_u156	Yes, I am!
s07_e02_c10_u157	Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
s07_e02_c11_u158	Hey Rach.
s07_e02_c11_u159	(quietly) Joey.
s07_e02_c11_u160	Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
s07_e02_c11_u161	Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
s07_e02_c11_u162	No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
s07_e02_c11_u163	Well no, I don't smell anything.
s07_e02_c11_u164	Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
s07_e02_c11_u165	(sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
s07_e02_c11_u166	Nothing!
s07_e02_c11_u167	(takes a drink) Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)
s07_e02_c11_u168	Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
s07_e02_c11_u169	So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
s07_e02_c11_u170	Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. (Exits.)
s07_e02_c11_u171	(chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) Sup?
s07_e02_c11_u172	(entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
s07_e02_c11_u173	(looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I'm sorry?
s07_e02_c11_u174	My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
s07_e02_c11_u175	(incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!
s07_e02_c11_u176	He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
s07_e02_c11_u177	Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
s07_e02_c11_u178	Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
s07_e02_c11_u179	Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
s07_e02_c11_u180	Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
s07_e02_c11_u181	He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
s07_e02_c11_u182	Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
s07_e02_c11_u183	His daughter was hot.
s07_e02_c11_u184	Gotcha.
s07_e02_c12_u185	Hey.
s07_e02_c12_u186	Hey.
s07_e02_c12_u187	Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
s07_e02_c12_u188	Ehh.
s07_e02_c12_u189	Eh, you work for that.
s07_e02_c12_u190	Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
s07_e02_c12_u191	You do?!
s07_e02_c12_u192	Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
s07_e02_c12_u193	Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
s07_e02_c12_u194	Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
s07_e02_c12_u195	You thought about that?
s07_e02_c12_u196	Yeah.
s07_e02_c12_u197	How many kids were we gonna have?
s07_e02_c12_u198	Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
s07_e02_c12_u199	What else did you think about?
s07_e02_c12_u200	Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
s07_e02_c12_u201	(laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
s07_e02_c12_u202	Sure you do.
s07_e02_c12_u203	No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
s07_e02_c12_u204	You sure?
s07_e02_c12_u205	Uh-hmm.
s07_e02_c12_u206	I love you so much.
s07_e02_c12_u207	I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
s07_e02_c12_u208	Oh yeah, totally!
s07_e02_c12_u209	Oh good.
s07_e02_c13_u210	Hello, Zelda.
s07_e02_c13_u211	Who are you supposed to be?
s07_e02_c13_u212	The vicar!
s07_e02_c13_u213	Do you even know what a vicar is?
s07_e02_c13_u214	Like a goalie, right?
s07_e02_c13_u215	(sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
s07_e02_c13_u216	All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)
s07_e02_c13_u217	All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
s07_e02_c13_u218	Huh?
s07_e02_c13_u219	(starting to move closer to him) That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
s07_e02_c13_u220	(nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)
s07_e02_c13_u221	(moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
s07_e02_c13_u222	This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)
s07_e02_c13_u223	Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
s07_e02_c13_u224	Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
s07_e02_c13_u225	Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride! (He backs into the door.)
s07_e02_c13_u226	I don't want to, I'm scared.
s05_e16_c01_u001	Hey!
s05_e16_c01_u002	Hey!
s05_e16_c01_u003	Hey!
s05_e16_c01_u004	What are you guys doing up?
s05_e16_c01_u005	Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
s05_e16_c01_u006	(thinks) Dark red.
s05_e16_c01_u007	Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?
s05_e16_c01_u008	(checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)
s05_e16_c01_u009	Aww, you guys are so cute!
s05_e16_c01_u010	I know.
s05_e16_c01_u011	All right, I'll see you in the morning.
s05_e16_c03_u012	(looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.
s05_e16_c03_u013	All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel! (Donates it.) How much more do we need?
s05_e16_c03_u014	A couple of bucks.
s05_e16_c03_u015	Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh my God, this is a police badge!
s05_e16_c03_u016	Wow!
s05_e16_c03_u017	Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
s05_e16_c03_u018	Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
s05_e16_c03_u019	Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in hope.)
s05_e16_c03_u020	(entering) Hey, you guys!
s05_e16_c03_u021	Hey!
s05_e16_c03_u022	Hey Joey!
s05_e16_c03_u023	Hey.
s05_e16_c03_u024	(To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
s05_e16_c03_u025	Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
s05_e16_c03_u026	Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.
s05_e16_c03_u027	I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
s05_e16_c03_u028	No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
s05_e16_c03_u029	Are you saying I smell bad?
s05_e16_c03_u030	No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the bathroom.)
s05_e16_c03_u031	What's with him?
s05_e16_c03_u032	Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
s05_e16_c04_u033	(disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!
s05_e16_c04_u034	(To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hovering nearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, (In a sexy voice) "Come here to me!"
s05_e16_c04_u035	What?! You say that to kids?!!
s05_e16_c04_u036	No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
s05_e16_c04_u037	Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
s05_e16_c04_u038	You picked a great couch.
s05_e16_c04_u039	Yeah?
s05_e16_c04_u040	Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? (Hands him a clipboard.)
s05_e16_c04_u041	Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
s05_e16_c04_u042	Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!
s05_e16_c04_u043	Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and hands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the couch.)
s05_e16_c04_u044	Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?
s05_e16_c04_u045	Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
s05_e16_c04_u046	(Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her amazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!
s05_e16_c04_u047	Yeah!
s05_e16_c04_u048	You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
s05_e16_c04_u049	Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the store.)
s05_e16_c04_u050	Ohh, okay. (Laughs.) Something didn't quite add up there. (Ross stops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes Rachel up against a wall.)
s05_e16_c04_u051	Ross!
s05_e16_c04_u052	What's that supposed to mean?
s05_e16_c04_u053	Ross!
s05_e16_c04_u054	Well you, her, I mean, she's very-y'know. And you're like-y'know.
s05_e16_c04_u055	Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
s05_e16_c04_u056	Really? You two?
s05_e16_c04_u057	Yeah! Rach?
s05_e16_c04_u058	Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
s05_e16_c04_u059	Then tell him quickly.
s05_e16_c04_u060	(To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.
s05_e16_c04_u061	Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
s05_e16_c04_u062	Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
s05_e16_c04_u063	A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!
s05_e16_c05_u064	Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
s05_e16_c05_u065	Yes?
s05_e16_c05_u066	You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
s05_e16_c05_u067	Yeah I can, it worked real well.
s05_e16_c05_u068	No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
s05_e16_c05_u069	I won't! (Turns away) Until I have my next cigarette.
s05_e16_c05_u070	Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
s05_e16_c05_u071	What?!
s05_e16_c05_u072	Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book 'em.
s05_e16_c05_u073	Who are you talking too?
s05_e16_c05_u074	Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
s05_e16_c05_u075	I am not going to apologize to a tree!
s05_e16_c05_u076	You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!
s05_e16_c05_u077	I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
s05_e16_c05_u078	Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
s05_e16_c06_u079	Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)
s05_e16_c06_u080	Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
s05_e16_c06_u081	Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
s05_e16_c06_u082	Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the railing.)
s05_e16_c06_u083	Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
s05_e16_c06_u084	Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay. You got it?
s05_e16_c06_u085	Yeah.
s05_e16_c06_u086	Good-good-good.
s05_e16_c06_u087	Oh-oh!
s05_e16_c06_u088	Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
s05_e16_c06_u089	Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
s05_e16_c07_u090	so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. (Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!
s05_e16_c07_u091	(cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
s05_e16_c07_u092	I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
s05_e16_c07_u093	Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
s05_e16_c07_u094	You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at her.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for the door just as Joey enters.)
s05_e16_c07_u095	(To Joey) Hey.
s05_e16_c07_u096	(To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.
s05_e16_c07_u097	Hi, Joe.
s05_e16_c07_u098	Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here.
s05_e16_c07_u099	Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)
s05_e16_c07_u100	(backing away) What?! Why?!
s05_e16_c07_u101	What is going on with you?
s05_e16_c07_u102	Nothing!
s05_e16_c07_u103	Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
s05_e16_c07_u104	All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)
s05_e16_c07_u105	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
s05_e16_c07_u106	Well, it involved Monica.
s05_e16_c07_u107	You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! (To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)
s05_e16_c07_u108	Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
s05_e16_c07_u109	What was the dream about?
s05_e16_c07_u110	Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
s05_e16_c07_u111	Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
s05_e16_c07_u112	It-it doesn't?
s05_e16_c07_u113	No!
s05_e16_c07_u114	No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
s05_e16_c07_u115	That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
s05_e16_c07_u116	Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
s05_e16_c07_u117	In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
s05_e16_c07_u118	Um-hmm.
s05_e16_c07_u119	Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
s05_e16_c07_u120	(looks at her) Not really.
s05_e16_c07_u121	Well there you have it!
s05_e16_c07_u122	Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
s05_e16_c07_u123	No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
s05_e16_c07_u124	Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
s05_e16_c07_u125	Friends first? That's interesting.
s05_e16_c07_u126	You become friends after?
s05_e16_c07_u127	No, never done that either.
s05_e16_c07_u128	(entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
s05_e16_c07_u129	Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
s05_e16_c07_u130	(laughing) That's right.
s05_e16_c07_u131	(noticing him) What's up Joey?
s05_e16_c07_u132	(in a sexy voice) How you doin'?
s05_e16_c08_u133	Excuse me, is this your car?
s05_e16_c08_u134	Yeah.
s05_e16_c08_u135	Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.
s05_e16_c08_u136	Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
s05_e16_c08_u137	Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)
s05_e16_c08_u138	(he reaches into the car and slams his siren on the roof.) So am I!
s05_e16_c08_u139	Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. (Tries to leave.)
s05_e16_c08_u140	(stopping her) Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
s05_e16_c08_u141	I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.
s05_e16_c08_u142	Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
s05_e16_c08_u143	I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
s05_e16_c08_u144	Who-who else is in vice up there?
s05_e16_c08_u145	Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?
s05_e16_c08_u146	Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
s05_e16_c08_u147	Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.
s05_e16_c08_u148	No, I don't know him.
s05_e16_c08_u149	(starts to walk away, but stops) Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.
s05_e16_c08_u150	Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
s05_e16_c08_u151	I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)
s05_e16_c08_u152	(following her) Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good. (Phoebe's stunned) And where did you find my badge?
s05_e16_c08_u153	Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs away.)
s05_e16_c09_u154	Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
s05_e16_c09_u155	Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you.
s05_e16_c09_u156	Thanks!
s05_e16_c09_u157	Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
s05_e16_c09_u158	I know.
s05_e16_c09_u159	Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
s05_e16_c09_u160	What's up Joe?
s05_e16_c09_u161	Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great
s05_e16_c09_u162	Yeah?
s05_e16_c09_u163	is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So
s05_e16_c09_u164	(laughing) What are you saying?
s05_e16_c09_u165	I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
s05_e16_c09_u166	Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
s05_e16_c09_u167	I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)
s05_e16_c09_u168	(laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm- No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
s05_e16_c09_u169	Won't-won't that take longer?
s05_e16_c09_u170	Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.
s05_e16_c09_u171	Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
s05_e16_c10_u172	Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
s05_e16_c10_u173	(entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
s05_e16_c10_u174	Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
s05_e16_c10_u175	Well, I brought the next best thing.
s05_e16_c10_u176	(entering) Hey!
s05_e16_c10_u177	Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
s05_e16_c10_u178	Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so
s05_e16_c10_u179	Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Okay Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.)
s05_e16_c10_u180	Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)
s05_e16_c10_u181	Oh, that's me.
s05_e16_c10_u182	Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
s05_e16_c10_u183	No! That's-that's my arm!
s05_e16_c10_u184	(looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
s05_e16_c10_u185	Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
s05_e16_c10_u186	Okay!
s05_e16_c10_u187	Okay.
s05_e16_c10_u188	Come on, Chandler.
s05_e16_c10_u189	All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!
s05_e16_c10_u190	All right, ready?
s05_e16_c10_u191	Yeah.
s05_e16_c10_u192	Turn.
s05_e16_c10_u193	(straining) Okay.
s05_e16_c10_u194	Turn! Turn!
s05_e16_c10_u195	Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
s05_e16_c10_u196	Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
s05_e16_c10_u197	Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
s05_e16_c10_u198	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
s05_e16_c10_u199	Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
s05_e16_c10_u200	All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.
s05_e16_c10_u201	Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
s05_e16_c10_u202	I can't believe that didn't work!
s05_e16_c10_u203	I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
s05_e16_c10_u204	Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
s05_e16_c11_u205	(entering) Hey!
s05_e16_c11_u206	Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
s05_e16_c11_u207	Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)
s05_e16_c11_u208	(stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
s05_e16_c11_u209	Uhh, well, she's-really good in bed.
s05_e16_c11_u210	Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
s05_e16_c11_u211	(To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!
s05_e16_c11_u212	What?! Why?!
s05_e16_c11_u213	Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her roommate!
s05_e16_c11_u214	What about the closeness?
s05_e16_c11_u215	Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
s05_e16_c12_u216	(entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!
s05_e16_c12_u217	Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
s05_e16_c12_u218	(taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
s05_e16_c12_u219	Who is it?
s05_e16_c12_u220	Uhh, just a minute officer!!
s05_e16_c12_u221	I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
s05_e16_c12_u222	Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
s05_e16_c12_u223	Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
s05_e16_c12_u224	Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me. (They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
s05_e16_c12_u225	Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
s05_e16_c12_u226	Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
s05_e16_c12_u227	I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
s05_e16_c12_u228	I would love it if I weren't here!
s05_e16_c12_u229	Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
s05_e16_c12_u230	Me?!
s05_e16_c12_u231	Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
s05_e16_c12_u232	Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
s05_e16_c12_u233	Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
s05_e16_c12_u234	Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer
s05_e16_c12_u235	Gary.
s05_e16_c12_u236	Gary.
s05_e16_c12_u237	Okay, so it's a date.
s05_e16_c12_u238	Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
s05_e16_c12_u239	Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
s05_e16_c12_u240	Ohh, impressive.
s05_e16_c12_u241	Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
s05_e16_c12_u242	Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
s05_e16_c12_u243	Okay. (He starts to leave.) So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
s05_e16_c12_u244	All right, I can't wait!
s05_e16_c12_u245	Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
s05_e16_c12_u246	(To Rachel) He has a gun!
s05_e16_c13_u247	I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
s05_e16_c13_u248	You wanna return this couch? (Ross nods yes.) It's cut in half!
s05_e16_c13_u249	That's what I'm telling you.
s05_e16_c13_u250	Did you cut this couch in half?
s05_e16_c13_u251	This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
s05_e16_c13_u252	You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!
s05_e16_c13_u253	Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
s05_e16_c13_u254	I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
s05_e16_c13_u255	(thinks) I take it.
s09_e19_c01_u001	(talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
s09_e19_c01_u002	I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
s09_e19_c01_u003	I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
s09_e19_c01_u004	Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
s09_e19_c01_u005	Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
s09_e19_c01_u006	Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
s09_e19_c01_u007	(excited) Are you serious?
s09_e19_c01_u008	Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
s09_e19_c01_u009	Hey, that was an honest mistake!
s09_e19_c01_u010	Right!(he starts to ape her)"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)
s09_e19_c01_u011	Yeah, that was an awesome day!
s09_e19_c02_u012	Hey!
s09_e19_c02_u013	Hey!
s09_e19_c02_u014	Hi!
s09_e19_c02_u015	So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
s09_e19_c02_u016	Sure!
s09_e19_c02_u017	I'd love to!
s09_e19_c02_u018	Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
s09_e19_c02_u019	Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
s09_e19_c02_u020	Phoebe, what happened?
s09_e19_c02_u021	Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
s09_e19_c02_u022	(To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
s09_e19_c02_u023	Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
s09_e19_c02_u024	What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!
s09_e19_c02_u025	Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
s09_e19_c02_u026	So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
s09_e19_c02_u027	Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
s09_e19_c02_u028	Are you really that busy?
s09_e19_c02_u029	Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.
s09_e19_c02_u030	Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?"
s09_e19_c02_u031	Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
s09_e19_c02_u032	And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
s09_e19_c02_u033	(on the phone) "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" (pause) "Oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
s09_e19_c02_u034	Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
s09_e19_c02_u035	I don't have travel insurance.
s09_e19_c02_u036	Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
s09_e19_c02_u037	Why don't you take Ross?
s09_e19_c02_u038	Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
s09_e19_c02_u039	No, not if their room has two beds!
s09_e19_c02_u040	(browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
s09_e19_c03_u041	Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
s09_e19_c03_u042	I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
s09_e19_c03_u043	Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!
s09_e19_c03_u044	Also so gay!
s09_e19_c03_u045	Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
s09_e19_c03_u046	Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
s09_e19_c03_u047	Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
s09_e19_c03_u048	Oh, wish me luck!
s09_e19_c03_u049	Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?
s09_e19_c03_u050	Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
s09_e19_c03_u051	Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)
s09_e19_c03_u052	On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION!
s09_e19_c03_u053	Drake! What are you doing in here?
s09_e19_c03_u054	Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
s09_e19_c03_u055	Get out!
s09_e19_c03_u056	You don't love him!
s09_e19_c03_u057	What do you know about love?
s09_e19_c03_u058	I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
s09_e19_c03_u059	That kiss never happened.
s09_e19_c03_u060	Oh, what about this one.
s09_e19_c03_u061	(watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!
s09_e19_c03_u062	No, I told you...get out!
s09_e19_c03_u063	Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
s09_e19_c03_u064	(talking to Rachel) You look familiar, have we...
s09_e19_c03_u065	SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
s09_e19_c03_u066	Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
s09_e19_c03_u067	I don't have a choice...
s09_e19_c03_u068	Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.
s09_e19_c03_u069	Don't say that...
s09_e19_c03_u070	Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her)
s09_e19_c03_u071	CUT!
s09_e19_c03_u072	NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call!
s09_e19_c04_u073	Everything was delicious!
s09_e19_c04_u074	Thank you!
s09_e19_c04_u075	It was. The duck in particular was superb.
s09_e19_c04_u076	Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...
s09_e19_c04_u077	Actually I do have one small complaint.
s09_e19_c04_u078	Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
s09_e19_c04_u079	The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
s09_e19_c04_u080	What musician?
s09_e19_c05_u081	(playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!
s09_e19_c05_u082	What are you doing here!
s09_e19_c05_u083	Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
s09_e19_c05_u084	Great!
s09_e19_c05_u085	Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
s09_e19_c05_u086	Listen Phoebe...
s09_e19_c05_u087	Yeah.
s09_e19_c05_u088	You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
s09_e19_c05_u089	But what?
s09_e19_c05_u090	This is kind of a classy place.
s09_e19_c05_u091	(pause) Ok, say no more.
s09_e19_c05_u092	(with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh?
s09_e19_c06_u093	Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
s09_e19_c06_u094	Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
s09_e19_c06_u095	New York.
s09_e19_c06_u096	(in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!
s09_e19_c06_u097	I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
s09_e19_c06_u098	Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
s09_e19_c06_u099	I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
s09_e19_c06_u100	Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
s09_e19_c06_u101	(high pitched voice) Check again please!
s09_e19_c06_u102	I'm sorry, it's not here.
s09_e19_c06_u103	Not there.
s09_e19_c06_u104	Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
s09_e19_c06_u105	I don't know what to say.
s09_e19_c06_u106	(mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!
s09_e19_c06_u107	Just give us the cheapest room you have.
s09_e19_c06_u108	Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
s09_e19_c06_u109	That's insane!
s09_e19_c06_u110	Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
s09_e19_c06_u111	Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.
s09_e19_c06_u112	Great.
s09_e19_c06_u113	(aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!
s09_e19_c06_u114	Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
s09_e19_c06_u115	Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
s09_e19_c06_u116	C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
s09_e19_c06_u117	Dude, you're shaking!
s09_e19_c06_u118	I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
s09_e19_c07_u119	Hi!
s09_e19_c07_u120	Hey!
s09_e19_c07_u121	Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
s09_e19_c07_u122	Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
s09_e19_c07_u123	God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
s09_e19_c07_u124	Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
s09_e19_c07_u125	Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
s09_e19_c07_u126	Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
s09_e19_c07_u127	Oh screw her, that part is mine!
s09_e19_c07_u128	Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
s09_e19_c07_u129	Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
s09_e19_c07_u130	I can't believe you married him.
s09_e19_c07_u131	But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
s09_e19_c07_u132	So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
s09_e19_c07_u133	It's over! You have to accept that.
s09_e19_c07_u134	How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
s09_e19_c07_u135	(pause) Kiss me.
s09_e19_c07_u136	What?
s09_e19_c07_u137	Kiss me.
s09_e19_c07_u138	Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
s09_e19_c07_u139	No, I'm saying...
s09_e19_c07_u140	but, but..
s09_e19_c07_u141	just... don't talk... (she kisses him)
s09_e19_c08_u142	(waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new!
s09_e19_c09_u143	(on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
s09_e19_c09_u144	What did you get?
s09_e19_c09_u145	USA Today
s09_e19_c09_u146	Nice, put it with the others.
s09_e19_c09_u147	And I also got... two more apples.
s09_e19_c09_u148	We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
s09_e19_c09_u149	I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
s09_e19_c09_u150	Oh, that's not cool.
s09_e19_c09_u151	Dude, none of this is cool.
s09_e19_c09_u152	No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through.
s09_e19_c09_u153	I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.
s09_e19_c09_u154	Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
s09_e19_c09_u155	Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?
s09_e19_c09_u156	No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
s09_e19_c09_u157	Yes, but the batteries...
s09_e19_c09_u158	Thank you, thank you very much!
s09_e19_c09_u159	Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
s09_e19_c09_u160	No!
s09_e19_c09_u161	At least tell me where you hid it.
s09_e19_c10_u162	Can I ask you a question?
s09_e19_c10_u163	Yeah.
s09_e19_c10_u164	Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
s09_e19_c10_u165	Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
s09_e19_c10_u166	Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
s09_e19_c10_u167	Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
s09_e19_c10_u168	Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
s09_e19_c10_u169	What do you think brought than on?
s09_e19_c10_u170	I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
s09_e19_c10_u171	A love scene? With who?
s09_e19_c10_u172	Olivia.
s09_e19_c10_u173	Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.
s09_e19_c10_u174	So do you think that my dream means anything?
s09_e19_c10_u175	I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
s09_e19_c10_u176	Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
s09_e19_c10_u177	Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
s09_e19_c10_u178	You took the same class twice.
s09_e19_c10_u179	It was hard!
s09_e19_c10_u180	Hey!
s09_e19_c10_u181	Hi.
s09_e19_c10_u182	Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
s09_e19_c10_u183	Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
s09_e19_c10_u184	Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
s09_e19_c10_u185	Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
s09_e19_c10_u186	Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).
s09_e19_c10_u187	Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
s09_e19_c10_u188	My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
s09_e19_c10_u189	Ok, we're still on that.
s09_e19_c10_u190	I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
s09_e19_c10_u191	Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
s09_e19_c10_u192	Tiny portions?
s09_e19_c10_u193	Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"!
s09_e19_c10_u194	Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
s09_e19_c10_u195	Well...it's not about quality.
s09_e19_c10_u196	Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
s09_e19_c10_u197	Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
s09_e19_c10_u198	Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
s09_e19_c10_u199	Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
s09_e19_c10_u200	You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
s09_e19_c10_u201	What are people having, the garlic Martini?
s09_e19_c11_u202	Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.
s09_e19_c11_u203	Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
s09_e19_c11_u204	Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
s09_e19_c11_u205	Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
s09_e19_c11_u206	Oh my god.
s09_e19_c11_u207	What?
s09_e19_c11_u208	There's something new in the bowl.
s09_e19_c11_u209	Look, we have enough, just walk away.
s09_e19_c11_u210	No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
s09_e19_c11_u211	There's a forest right outside.
s09_e19_c11_u212	It's not the same.
s09_e19_c11_u213	Ok, go quick!
s09_e19_c11_u214	(to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.
s09_e19_c11_u215	Oh, my maple candy!
s09_e19_c12_u216	(singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
s09_e19_c12_u217	Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
s09_e19_c12_u218	You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
s09_e19_c12_u219	Ok, you have to stop playing now.
s09_e19_c12_u220	Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
s09_e19_c12_u221	Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
s09_e19_c12_u222	(while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!
s09_e19_c12_u223	(to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)
s09_e19_c12_u224	Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!
s09_e19_c12_u225	Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).
s09_e19_c12_u226	Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
s09_e19_c12_u227	Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
s09_e19_c12_u228	Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).
s09_e19_c12_u229	Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)
s09_e19_c12_u230	Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
s09_e19_c12_u231	I'm sorry...
s09_e19_c12_u232	I'm sorry too... (they hug)
s09_e19_c12_u233	ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
s09_e19_c12_u234	Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
s09_e19_c12_u235	(smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
s09_e19_c13_u236	Hey!
s09_e19_c13_u237	Hey!
s09_e19_c13_u238	Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
s09_e19_c13_u239	(Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!
s09_e19_c13_u240	(looks puzzled) How...how...?
s09_e19_c13_u241	I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
s09_e19_c13_u242	uh-huh
s09_e19_c13_u243	And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
s09_e19_c13_u244	(to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...
s09_e19_c13_u245	What?
s09_e19_c13_u246	What...how is it going with Drake?
s09_e19_c13_u247	Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
s09_e19_c13_u248	What...that scene I saw was so good!
s09_e19_c13_u249	Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
s09_e19_c13_u250	Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
s09_e19_c13_u251	A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
s09_e19_c13_u252	So?
s09_e19_c13_u253	So...I've never played that!
s09_e19_c13_u254	Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
s09_e19_c13_u255	Uh...well...just once...with you...
s09_e19_c13_u256	Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
s09_e19_c13_u257	(looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??
s09_e19_c13_u258	(shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
s09_e19_c13_u259	(approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
s09_e19_c13_u260	(looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
s09_e19_c13_u261	Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
s09_e19_c13_u262	(excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
s09_e19_c14_u263	I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)
s09_e19_c14_u264	(without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!
s09_e19_c14_u265	(sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
s07_e18_c01_u001	Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent
s07_e18_c01_u002	Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) I'm sorry, too soon. You go.
s07_e18_c01_u003	Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
s07_e18_c01_u004	Joey!
s07_e18_c01_u005	Good for you!
s07_e18_c01_u006	Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
s07_e18_c01_u007	No-no.
s07_e18_c01_u008	Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
s07_e18_c01_u009	No! I'm up for a Soapie!
s07_e18_c01_u010	Honey? Is that something you're making up?
s07_e18_c01_u011	No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. (Rachel returns from the bathroom.) Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
s07_e18_c01_u012	(gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
s07_e18_c01_u013	Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards. (Points to Rachel.)
s07_e18_c01_u014	Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be there?
s07_e18_c01_u015	Many are scheduled to appear.
s07_e18_c01_u016	Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
s07_e18_c01_u017	(to Joey) Okay, I'll go!
s07_e18_c01_u018	No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
s07_e18_c02_u019	and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis?
s07_e18_c02_u020	What kinda noise?
s07_e18_c02_u021	Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
s07_e18_c02_u022	But like how?
s07_e18_c02_u023	Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn't know what to make of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
s07_e18_c02_u024	Yes sir.
s07_e18_c02_u025	Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
s07_e18_c02_u026	(shocked) Why?!
s07_e18_c02_u027	Well you need 60% to pass
s07_e18_c02_u028	What'd I get?
s07_e18_c02_u029	Seven.
s07_e18_c02_u030	That's not so good.
s07_e18_c02_u031	No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
s07_e18_c02_u032	Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
s07_e18_c02_u033	Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
s07_e18_c02_u034	I'm in love with you.
s07_e18_c02_u035	Well that brings me in the loop a little.
s07_e18_c02_u036	You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there (Points to the podium) and you're teaching and your face gets all serious-you look so good. (In a sexy voice) You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater
s07_e18_c02_u037	Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
s07_e18_c03_u038	Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
s07_e18_c03_u039	Really? (Looks.) My God, he's really cute.
s07_e18_c03_u040	Go for it.
s07_e18_c03_u041	Phoebe, I'm engaged!
s07_e18_c03_u042	I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
s07_e18_c03_u043	Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged. (Points to her ring.)
s07_e18_c03_u044	Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.)
s07_e18_c03_u045	I did, but that was really fun.
s07_e18_c04_u046	(pretending to be an announcer) And the winner is-Joey Tribbiani! (He then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a bottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh- Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel
s07_e18_c04_u047	I'm fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
s07_e18_c04_u048	Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
s07_e18_c04_u049	What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
s07_e18_c04_u050	Really?
s07_e18_c04_u051	Yeah.
s07_e18_c04_u052	What award are you practicing for?
s07_e18_c04_u053	Grammy, Best New Artist.
s07_e18_c04_u054	Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
s07_e18_c04_u055	Ohh that's great!
s07_e18_c04_u056	Yeah!
s07_e18_c04_u057	So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
s07_e18_c04_u058	(confused) What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
s07_e18_c04_u059	Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
s07_e18_c04_u060	Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just-I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
s07_e18_c04_u061	Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like- (Does it, you'll have to see it.)
s07_e18_c04_u062	Hey! (Likes it.)
s07_e18_c04_u063	Y'know?
s07_e18_c04_u064	You practice losing the Grammies too?
s07_e18_c04_u065	Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
s07_e18_c04_u066	Ah.
s07_e18_c05_u067	Oh hey!
s07_e18_c05_u068	Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
s07_e18_c05_u069	Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)
s07_e18_c05_u070	Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
s07_e18_c05_u071	(laughs) All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
s07_e18_c05_u072	And did he?
s07_e18_c05_u073	I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)
s07_e18_c05_u074	Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
s07_e18_c05_u075	I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
s07_e18_c05_u076	Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
s07_e18_c05_u077	You sound like a guy.
s07_e18_c05_u078	No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I-I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
s07_e18_c05_u079	You'll have a last kiss.
s07_e18_c06_u080	Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
s07_e18_c06_u081	Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
s07_e18_c06_u082	There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
s07_e18_c06_u083	Whoa!
s07_e18_c06_u084	(entering from her room) Whoa what?
s07_e18_c06_u085	Ross has a boyfriend.
s07_e18_c06_u086	I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
s07_e18_c06_u087	Really?
s07_e18_c06_u088	Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of-sexy professor vibe? (Rachel and Joey both look at him.)
s07_e18_c06_u089	Not right now.
s07_e18_c06_u090	It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
s07_e18_c06_u091	Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
s07_e18_c06_u092	Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
s07_e18_c06_u093	Yeah.
s07_e18_c06_u094	How'd you get over that teacher?
s07_e18_c06_u095	I didn't. I got under him.
s07_e18_c06_u096	(To Ross) Problem solved.
s07_e18_c07_u097	Bye Phoebe.
s07_e18_c07_u098	Okay bye. (They kiss.)
s07_e18_c07_u099	All right. Bye. (Backs out the door.)
s07_e18_c07_u100	Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
s07_e18_c07_u101	Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling
s07_e18_c07_u102	(yelling through the window to Phoebe) I miss you already!!
s07_e18_c07_u103	(yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)
s07_e18_c07_u104	See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. (Chandler approaches.) Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
s07_e18_c07_u105	Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.
s07_e18_c08_u106	(To Rachel) This is it! This is my category.
s07_e18_c08_u107	I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
s07_e18_c08_u108	Yeah, I got my speech!
s07_e18_c08_u109	Do you got your gracious loser face?
s07_e18_c08_u110	Yeah. (Does it.)
s07_e18_c08_u111	Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
s07_e18_c08_u112	Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
s07_e18_c08_u113	On TV?! Yeah!
s07_e18_c08_u114	Kay!
s07_e18_c08_u115	in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are: John Wheeler from General Hospital (Applause), Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless (Applause), Dunkin Harrington from Passions (Applause), and Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives (Applause). And the Soapie goes to-(She opens the envelope)-Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless!
s07_e18_c08_u116	What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which is drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that he's on TV right now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)
s07_e18_c09_u117	(angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. (There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of the nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is-(Opens the envelope)-Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is turned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)
s07_e18_c10_u118	Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
s07_e18_c10_u119	Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! (He whips out the award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)
s07_e18_c10_u120	Oh my God you stole her award!
s07_e18_c10_u121	No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above the TV to display it.)
s07_e18_c10_u122	Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
s07_e18_c10_u123	Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
s07_e18_c10_u124	Joey, you have got to take this back!
s07_e18_c10_u125	But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
s07_e18_c10_u126	(looking at the award) No! Joey!
s07_e18_c10_u127	Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of em.
s07_e18_c10_u128	Do you really want an award you didn't win?
s07_e18_c10_u129	No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
s07_e18_c10_u130	Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
s07_e18_c10_u131	I can scratch that right off.
s07_e18_c10_u132	Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
s07_e18_c10_u133	All right!
s07_e18_c10_u134	All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you.
s07_e18_c10_u135	I'll take it back tomorrow.
s07_e18_c10_u136	Thank you.
s07_e18_c10_u137	(opening his door) If I can't have it you can't have it! (Rachel walks away angrily.)
s07_e18_c11_u138	Professor Geller?
s07_e18_c11_u139	(turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
s07_e18_c11_u140	I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
s07_e18_c11_u141	And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)
s07_e18_c11_u142	Because I'm in love with you.
s07_e18_c11_u143	(turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!
s07_e18_c11_u144	Yeah, I'm all-in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
s07_e18_c11_u145	No!
s07_e18_c11_u146	Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
s07_e18_c11_u147	Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
s07_e18_c11_u148	No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
s07_e18_c11_u149	What?
s07_e18_c11_u150	He's got a girlfriend!
s07_e18_c11_u151	I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
s07_e18_c11_u152	I know! It's awful. I love you.
s07_e18_c12_u153	Have you seen Chandler?
s07_e18_c12_u154	No. Why?
s07_e18_c12_u155	Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
s07_e18_c12_u156	Okay, don't sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute. (Points to a guy sitting behind Monica.)
s07_e18_c12_u157	Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
s07_e18_c12_u158	No that is the last thing you want to do!
s07_e18_c12_u159	Why?
s07_e18_c12_u160	Because you're marrying him!
s07_e18_c12_u161	You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
s07_e18_c12_u162	All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
s07_e18_c12_u163	So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
s07_e18_c12_u164	That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
s07_e18_c12_u165	Your mother told you this?
s07_e18_c12_u166	Yes!
s07_e18_c12_u167	The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
s07_e18_c12_u168	Oh my God! You're right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love? (Monica is shocked.)
s07_e18_c13_u169	I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
s07_e18_c13_u170	Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
s07_e18_c13_u171	Okay, I'm totally cool! (She coolly knocks on the door)
s07_e18_c13_u172	Come in.
s07_e18_c13_u173	Hey Jessica.
s07_e18_c13_u174	(coolly) Hey Jess.
s07_e18_c13_u175	Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
s07_e18_c13_u176	Hi.
s07_e18_c13_u177	Sup? (Joey glares at her.)
s07_e18_c13_u178	Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it to her.)
s07_e18_c13_u179	(shocked) Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?! (She rolls her eyes and throws it onto the couch.)
s07_e18_c13_u180	Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
s07_e18_c13_u181	No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me. (She exits.)
s07_e18_c13_u182	(To Rachel) Take it back?
s07_e18_c13_u183	Absolutely.
s07_e18_c13_u184	Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with flowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)
s07_e18_c14_u185	Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
s07_e18_c14_u186	Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
s07_e18_c14_u187	You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
s07_e18_c14_u188	Kinda. They're really big.
s07_e18_c14_u189	Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
s07_e18_c14_u190	What?
s07_e18_c14_u191	Just, I love you so much. Just-It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
s07_e18_c14_u192	No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
s07_e18_c14_u193	Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
s07_e18_c14_u194	Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
s07_e18_c14_u195	Even with me?
s07_e18_c14_u196	I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
s07_e18_c14_u197	Really?
s07_e18_c14_u198	Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
s07_e18_c14_u199	Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid
s07_e18_c14_u200	(hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
s07_e18_c15_u201	Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
s07_e18_c15_u202	(walking up) That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
s07_e18_c15_u203	Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
s07_e18_c15_u204	What?! Why?
s07_e18_c15_u205	Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
s07_e18_c15_u206	I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
s07_e18_c15_u207	Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay-(Ned looks shocked)-Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. (To Ned) Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)
s07_e18_c16_u208	Rach?
s07_e18_c16_u209	I'll be out in a second.
s07_e18_c16_u210	Oh. (Picks it up.) It's just so unexpected! I-I uh-Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in

s06_e11_c01_u004	Honey, we have been through this before!
s06_e11_c01_u005	Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
s06_e11_c01_u006	She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
s06_e11_c01_u007	Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!
s06_e11_c01_u008	You serious?!
s06_e11_c01_u009	That's great!
s06_e11_c01_u010	Really?!
s06_e11_c01_u011	Yeah well, we'll see.
s06_e11_c01_u012	You kissed her.
s06_e11_c01_u013	Oh we kissed it up real nice.
s06_e11_c01_u014	So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
s06_e11_c01_u015	I came over here to tell you guys.
s06_e11_c01_u016	So she's just waiting over there for ya?
s06_e11_c02_u017	I gotta go.
s06_e11_c02_u018	Okay. (They kiss.)
s06_e11_c02_u019	I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
s06_e11_c02_u020	Okay. (They kiss.)
s06_e11_c02_u021	Okay, now I'm really late. (Gets up.)
s06_e11_c02_u022	Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips? (She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)
s06_e11_c02_u023	(to Monica and Rachel) Bye.
s06_e11_c02_u024	Bye. (Janine exits.)
s06_e11_c02_u025	Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
s06_e11_c02_u026	I am so glad you said cooks.
s06_e11_c02_u027	I know.
s06_e11_c02_u028	(entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. (Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
s06_e11_c02_u029	Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.
s06_e11_c02_u030	I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
s06_e11_c02_u031	Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.)
s06_e11_c02_u032	You got it from Pottery Barn?!
s06_e11_c02_u033	Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
s06_e11_c02_u034	A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)
s06_e11_c02_u035	Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
s06_e11_c02_u036	I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
s06_e11_c02_u037	You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
s06_e11_c02_u038	(indignant) I was tired!
s06_e11_c02_u039	Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
s06_e11_c02_u040	Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
s06_e11_c02_u041	Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
s06_e11_c02_u042	It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
s06_e11_c02_u043	Hey! I made that for her!
s06_e11_c02_u044	You made pottery?
s06_e11_c02_u045	Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
s06_e11_c02_u046	I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
s06_e11_c02_u047	Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
s06_e11_c02_u048	Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore
s06_e11_c03_u049	so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it." (Everyone laughs.)
s06_e11_c03_u050	I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
s06_e11_c03_u051	Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
s06_e11_c03_u052	I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
s06_e11_c03_u053	Yeah.
s06_e11_c03_u054	And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.
s06_e11_c03_u055	So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
s06_e11_c03_u056	Oh that would be great!
s06_e11_c03_u057	Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
s06_e11_c03_u058	Joey, you don't have too!
s06_e11_c03_u059	Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get the wine right?
s06_e11_c03_u060	Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.
s06_e11_c03_u061	See ya tomorrow!
s06_e11_c03_u062	Tomorrow!
s06_e11_c03_u063	Can't wait! (They each go into their respective apartments.)
s06_e11_c03_u064	How are we gonna get out of that one?
s06_e11_c03_u065	What?
s06_e11_c03_u066	I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
s06_e11_c03_u067	What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
s06_e11_c03_u068	I don't know, they're just a little blah!
s06_e11_c03_u069	Blah?!
s06_e11_c03_u070	Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
s06_e11_c03_u071	Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? Cause that would kinda be a problem.
s06_e11_c03_u072	No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
s06_e11_c03_u073	I guess.
s06_e11_c03_u074	Thank you. (They kiss.)
s06_e11_c03_u075	If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
s06_e11_c04_u076	Hey!
s06_e11_c04_u077	Hey!
s06_e11_c04_u078	(sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
s06_e11_c04_u079	Guess!
s06_e11_c04_u080	Umm, a flea market?
s06_e11_c04_u081	Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
s06_e11_c04_u082	Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She's opening and closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
s06_e11_c04_u083	Ohh, yes.
s06_e11_c04_u084	Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
s06_e11_c04_u085	Almost.
s06_e11_c04_u086	How much was it?
s06_e11_c04_u087	It was only 500 bucks.
s06_e11_c04_u088	500 bucks at a flea market?!
s06_e11_c04_u089	Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
s06_e11_c04_u090	Oh no.
s06_e11_c04_u091	Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
s06_e11_c04_u092	A dollar?
s06_e11_c04_u093	And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
s06_e11_c04_u094	Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
s06_e11_c04_u095	Yeah.
s06_e11_c04_u096	Well, what period is it from?
s06_e11_c04_u097	Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
s06_e11_c04_u098	Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or
s06_e11_c04_u099	Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
s06_e11_c04_u100	(gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
s06_e11_c05_u101	Hey! We're here!
s06_e11_c05_u102	Hey!
s06_e11_c05_u103	(seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!
s06_e11_c05_u104	You like it?
s06_e11_c05_u105	Oh no!
s06_e11_c05_u106	It's my new apothecary table!
s06_e11_c05_u107	Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
s06_e11_c05_u108	Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
s06_e11_c05_u109	I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
s06_e11_c05_u110	Why did you do that?
s06_e11_c05_u111	Because she hates Pottery Barn.
s06_e11_c05_u112	She hates Pottery Barn?!!
s06_e11_c05_u113	I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
s06_e11_c05_u114	What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)
s06_e11_c05_u115	Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
s06_e11_c05_u116	Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
s06_e11_c05_u117	Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
s06_e11_c05_u118	Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
s06_e11_c05_u119	Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
s06_e11_c05_u120	Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
s06_e11_c05_u121	(entering) Hey!
s06_e11_c05_u122	Hey!
s06_e11_c05_u123	Hey!
s06_e11_c05_u124	Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
s06_e11_c05_u125	Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.)
s06_e11_c05_u126	Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
s06_e11_c05_u127	Sure!
s06_e11_c05_u128	He got it a flea market!
s06_e11_c05_u129	You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
s06_e11_c06_u130	Hey!
s06_e11_c06_u131	Hi!
s06_e11_c06_u132	The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
s06_e11_c06_u133	And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
s06_e11_c06_u134	Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
s06_e11_c06_u135	What happened to Janine?
s06_e11_c06_u136	Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
s06_e11_c06_u137	Oh that's too bad.
s06_e11_c06_u138	Yeah, she's been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high fever, a nose problem- Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
s06_e11_c06_u139	(entering from her room) Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
s06_e11_c06_u140	Kay!
s06_e11_c06_u141	Bye. (Exits)
s06_e11_c06_u142	That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
s06_e11_c07_u143	No-no, she really is sick!
s06_e11_c07_u144	Then why-why is she going to a play?!
s06_e11_c07_u145	Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
s06_e11_c07_u146	Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
s06_e11_c07_u147	Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
s06_e11_c07_u148	Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
s06_e11_c07_u149	Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
s06_e11_c07_u150	(loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?
s06_e11_c07_u151	So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
s06_e11_c07_u152	Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
s06_e11_c07_u153	And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
s06_e11_c07_u154	I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
s06_e11_c07_u155	No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
s06_e11_c07_u156	I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
s06_e11_c07_u157	Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)
s06_e11_c07_u158	Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
s06_e11_c07_u159	Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
s06_e11_c07_u160	Okay.
s06_e11_c07_u161	(from the hallway) I do not like that woman!
s06_e11_c07_u162	(shouting) I can hear you!
s06_e11_c07_u163	I am loud!
s06_e11_c08_u164	Aww! (They all laugh.)
s06_e11_c08_u165	That's funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross's table.)
s06_e11_c08_u166	Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new-(On Rachel's glare)-old sheet?
s06_e11_c08_u167	Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her which spills the wine.) Noo!
s06_e11_c08_u168	Ohh!!
s06_e11_c08_u169	My apothecary table!!!
s06_e11_c08_u170	What?!
s06_e11_c08_u171	Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.)
s06_e11_c08_u172	Ross, where did you get this?!
s06_e11_c08_u173	I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
s06_e11_c08_u174	Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
s06_e11_c08_u175	Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
s06_e11_c08_u176	Oh yes.
s06_e11_c08_u177	Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
s06_e11_c08_u178	Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
s06_e11_c08_u179	Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at Rachel)
s06_e11_c09_u180	Okay, one more time.
s06_e11_c09_u181	Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
s06_e11_c09_u182	Perfect decibel.
s06_e11_c09_u183	(loudly) I know!!!
s06_e11_c09_u184	(entering) Hey!
s06_e11_c09_u185	Hey.
s06_e11_c09_u186	So uh, what are you guys doing?
s06_e11_c09_u187	Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
s06_e11_c09_u188	Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
s06_e11_c09_u189	Well, I'd like to but, (extremely quietly) I'm not sure we have time to go.
s06_e11_c09_u190	Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
s06_e11_c09_u191	We owe you?!
s06_e11_c09_u192	That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
s06_e11_c09_u193	We didn't give you any money! (Chandler is motioning, "No!")
s06_e11_c09_u194	You don't think I know that!
s06_e11_c10_u195	see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
s06_e11_c10_u196	Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
s06_e11_c10_u197	I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
s06_e11_c10_u198	A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
s06_e11_c10_u199	(entering) Hey!
s06_e11_c10_u200	Hey.
s06_e11_c10_u201	(sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
s06_e11_c10_u202	(glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.
s06_e11_c10_u203	(gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
s06_e11_c10_u204	Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
s06_e11_c10_u205	Ah!
s06_e11_c10_u206	Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)
s06_e11_c10_u207	Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
s06_e11_c10_u208	Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
s06_e11_c10_u209	Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
s06_e11_c10_u210	Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
s06_e11_c10_u211	Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
s06_e11_c10_u212	(not sure of what to do) Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
s06_e11_c10_u213	No! I do want to!
s06_e11_c10_u214	Oh, she does want to.
s06_e11_c10_u215	She does want to.
s06_e11_c10_u216	Yeah!
s06_e11_c11_u217	Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
s06_e11_c11_u218	Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
s06_e11_c11_u219	Yeah.
s06_e11_c11_u220	Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
s06_e11_c11_u221	Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously, don't look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)
s06_e11_c11_u222	No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
s06_e11_c11_u223	Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
s06_e11_c11_u224	That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the-wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
s06_e11_c11_u225	No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the- (Looks desperately for something different.) We don't have the-that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
s06_e11_c11_u226	Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
s06_e11_c11_u227	Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just- Come on don't be mad.
s06_e11_c11_u228	No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
s06_e11_c11_u229	Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
s06_e11_c11_u230	I can't! I can't! Unless- Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
s06_e11_c11_u231	What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
s06_e11_c11_u232	But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
s06_e11_c11_u233	(gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
s06_e11_c11_u234	Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
s06_e11_c11_u235	That's right!
s06_e11_c11_u236	But at least the apothecary table is real.
s06_e11_c12_u237	Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
s06_e11_c12_u238	Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
s06_e11_c12_u239	That's totally understandable.
s06_e11_c12_u240	Don't worry about it.
s06_e11_c12_u241	So we can go out again?
s06_e11_c12_u242	Oh yeah!
s06_e11_c12_u243	Absolutely!
s06_e11_c12_u244	Oh good.
s06_e11_c12_u245	Oh well then, good night!
s06_e11_c12_u246	Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)
s06_e11_c12_u247	See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
s06_e11_c12_u248	We have got to move!
s06_e11_c12_u249	(bursting in) I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
s06_e11_c12_u250	And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
s06_e11_c12_u251	Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
s06_e11_c12_u252	(steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
s06_e11_c12_u253	All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)
s06_e11_c12_u254	(To Monica) Y'know I think you can take her.
s06_e11_c12_u255	(to Janine) You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!! (They exit.)
s06_e11_c12_u256	All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
s06_e11_c12_u257	They said stuff to me too, y'know!
s06_e11_c12_u258	I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They- They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I- I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. (Starts to break up) I'm very upset.
s06_e11_c12_u259	Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
s06_e11_c12_u260	Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.)
s06_e11_c12_u261	What did I tell you about the hall?!
s06_e11_c12_u262	I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
s06_e11_c12_u263	Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
s06_e11_c12_u264	Great.
s06_e11_c12_u265	Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
s06_e11_c12_u266	Me too.
s06_e11_c12_u267	Okay.
s06_e11_c12_u268	I'll see you.
s06_e11_c12_u269	Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)
s06_e11_c12_u270	(muttering to herself) Or I'll hear you.
s06_e11_c12_u271	(hearing that) That's it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with the garbage bag) Come on!
s06_e11_c12_u272	Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)
s06_e11_c12_u273	(chasing her) You'd better run!
s06_e11_c12_u274	Did you hear that?
s06_e11_c12_u275	Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
s06_e11_c12_u276	Yeah, I'm sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?
s06_e11_c12_u277	Yeah! (They head downstairs.)
s06_e11_c13_u278	Hey!
s06_e11_c13_u279	How ya doin'?
s06_e11_c13_u280	Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
s06_e11_c13_u281	Pretty much, yeah.
s06_e11_c13_u282	I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
s06_e11_c13_u283	Well, when it's not right, you know it.
s06_e11_c13_u284	You okay?
s06_e11_c13_u285	Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
s06_e11_c13_u286	Y'know what would cheer you up?
s06_e11_c13_u287	What?
s06_e11_c13_u288	I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
s06_e11_c13_u289	(laughing hysterically) You're right! That did cheer me up!
s07_e19_c01_u001	(To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?
s07_e19_c01_u002	I'm sorry, do I know you?
s07_e19_c01_u003	What are you doing?
s07_e19_c01_u004	Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
s07_e19_c01_u005	Oh! You got it?!
s07_e19_c01_u006	Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
s07_e19_c01_u007	What was it for?
s07_e19_c01_u008	Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
s07_e19_c01_u009	The next, next?
s07_e19_c01_u010	Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. (Joey's cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!
s07_e19_c01_u011	(to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!
s07_e19_c01_u012	(on phone) Oh my God!
s07_e19_c01_u013	Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)
s07_e19_c01_u014	What's the matter?
s07_e19_c01_u015	They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
s07_e19_c01_u016	Wow!
s07_e19_c01_u017	I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
s07_e19_c01_u018	Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
s07_e19_c02_u019	Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
s07_e19_c02_u020	Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
s07_e19_c02_u021	A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
s07_e19_c02_u022	Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
s07_e19_c02_u023	Sure.
s07_e19_c02_u024	I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
s07_e19_c02_u025	Cassie?
s07_e19_c02_u026	Uh-hmm.
s07_e19_c02_u027	Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
s07_e19_c02_u028	Ross, she's 25 years old.
s07_e19_c02_u029	So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
s07_e19_c02_u030	(entering) Hi!
s07_e19_c02_u031	Hey!
s07_e19_c02_u032	Hey!
s07_e19_c02_u033	Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
s07_e19_c02_u034	Yeah!
s07_e19_c02_u035	Subtle guys!
s07_e19_c02_u036	What?!
s07_e19_c02_u037	I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
s07_e19_c02_u038	(laughs) Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
s07_e19_c02_u039	Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)
s07_e19_c02_u040	(To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
s07_e19_c03_u041	Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
s07_e19_c03_u042	I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
s07_e19_c03_u043	That's what you say about porn.
s07_e19_c03_u044	You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
s07_e19_c03_u045	No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
s07_e19_c03_u046	Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
s07_e19_c03_u047	Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)
s07_e19_c04_u048	Well when can we have this shower?
s07_e19_c04_u049	She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday
s07_e19_c04_u050	Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
s07_e19_c04_u051	Yesterday!
s07_e19_c04_u052	Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
s07_e19_c04_u053	Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
s07_e19_c04_u054	Rachel, calm down!
s07_e19_c04_u055	(calmly) Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
s07_e19_c04_u056	(grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!
s07_e19_c04_u057	Phoebe, I already, I already did.
s07_e19_c04_u058	Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
s07_e19_c04_u059	Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
s07_e19_c04_u060	Uh, here. What time?
s07_e19_c04_u061	4 o'clock. Food?
s07_e19_c04_u062	Finger sandwiches and tea.
s07_e19_c04_u063	Ooh great! Very Monica.
s07_e19_c04_u064	And chili!
s07_e19_c04_u065	Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
s07_e19_c04_u066	Both!
s07_e19_c04_u067	We're paying for this y'know.
s07_e19_c04_u068	Neither.
s07_e19_c04_u069	Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
s07_e19_c04_u070	Lusts of the flesh.
s07_e19_c04_u071	(pause) What?
s07_e19_c04_u072	I don't know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?
s07_e19_c05_u073	Hey!
s07_e19_c05_u074	Hey!
s07_e19_c05_u075	Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
s07_e19_c05_u076	Oh boy me too!
s07_e19_c05_u077	Y'know I was thinking if we had a-a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
s07_e19_c05_u078	Yeah?
s07_e19_c05_u079	Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
s07_e19_c05_u080	The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
s07_e19_c05_u081	That's me! Come on!
s07_e19_c05_u082	Okay. (They both jump up to head for there room, but Monica stops.) But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
s07_e19_c05_u083	Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
s07_e19_c05_u084	Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
s07_e19_c05_u085	I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
s07_e19_c05_u086	(transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
s07_e19_c05_u087	Nice to meet you too.
s07_e19_c05_u088	So, are you ready to go?
s07_e19_c05_u089	Yeah.
s07_e19_c05_u090	(catching him) Chandler!
s07_e19_c05_u091	I'll be right with you.
s07_e19_c06_u092	(To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.
s07_e19_c06_u093	What-why?
s07_e19_c06_u094	Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
s07_e19_c06_u095	What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
s07_e19_c06_u096	I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica's eyes.) Say something.
s07_e19_c06_u097	You were staring about eight inches south of there.
s07_e19_c06_u098	Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
s07_e19_c06_u099	She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
s07_e19_c06_u100	Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
s07_e19_c06_u101	Wafer thin ice!
s07_e19_c07_u102	Hey, I'm back!
s07_e19_c07_u103	Hi-hi Joey.
s07_e19_c07_u104	Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
s07_e19_c07_u105	Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
s07_e19_c07_u106	Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! (Starts to leave.)
s07_e19_c07_u107	Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
s07_e19_c07_u108	And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
s07_e19_c07_u109	Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
s07_e19_c07_u110	Wow! Sure! That's great!
s07_e19_c07_u111	Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
s07_e19_c07_u112	Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
s07_e19_c07_u113	Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So- (Laughs.)
s07_e19_c07_u114	So-What?
s07_e19_c07_u115	So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
s07_e19_c07_u116	Yes!
s07_e19_c07_u117	Okay.
s07_e19_c07_u118	No. What?
s07_e19_c07_u119	An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be
s07_e19_c07_u120	Barmifsaed?
s07_e19_c08_u121	So to get this part you can't be?
s07_e19_c08_u122	Nope.
s07_e19_c08_u123	But you are?
s07_e19_c08_u124	Yep.
s07_e19_c08_u125	But you told them you weren't?
s07_e19_c08_u126	That's right.
s07_e19_c08_u127	Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?
s07_e19_c08_u128	I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
s07_e19_c08_u129	Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to-grow a turtleneck!
s07_e19_c08_u130	I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
s07_e19_c08_u131	Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
s07_e19_c08_u132	I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part. (Gets up for the phone.)
s07_e19_c08_u133	Unless!
s07_e19_c08_u134	Unless what?
s07_e19_c08_u135	Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
s07_e19_c08_u136	Like what?
s07_e19_c08_u137	Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
s07_e19_c09_u138	Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
s07_e19_c09_u139	Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
s07_e19_c09_u140	Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
s07_e19_c09_u141	(entering) Hey!
s07_e19_c09_u142	Hey!
s07_e19_c09_u143	Hey! What's up Mon?
s07_e19_c09_u144	Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
s07_e19_c09_u145	Have at it.
s07_e19_c09_u146	Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? (Picks it up) That won't work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope that won't work.
s07_e19_c09_u147	Are you makin' him a sandwich?
s07_e19_c09_u148	No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
s07_e19_c09_u149	I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! (Runs out.)
s07_e19_c09_u150	(To Phoebe, after Monica's gone) We have to get her a present?!
s07_e19_c09_u151	Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! (Holds it up.) We have a guest list!
s07_e19_c09_u152	Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
s07_e19_c09_u153	Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)
s07_e19_c10_u154	(shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
s07_e19_c10_u155	Hey Ross!
s07_e19_c10_u156	Hey!
s07_e19_c10_u157	(hugs him) It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
s07_e19_c10_u158	Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
s07_e19_c10_u159	Ah yeah, sorry about that.
s07_e19_c10_u160	It's okay. Come, come on in.
s07_e19_c10_u161	Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
s07_e19_c10_u162	Oh.
s07_e19_c10_u163	Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
s07_e19_c10_u164	Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
s07_e19_c10_u165	Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
s07_e19_c10_u166	Yeah-No!!
s07_e19_c11_u167	Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that-hot dog.
s07_e19_c11_u168	I'm all done.
s07_e19_c11_u169	(quietly) Thank God.
s07_e19_c11_u170	I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
s07_e19_c11_u171	Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried? (She laughs) We're probably too old to do that now.
s07_e19_c11_u172	I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles. (She pulls her blouse open to show him her shoulder and bra strap.)
s07_e19_c11_u173	(looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
s07_e19_c11_u174	It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
s07_e19_c11_u175	Well I'm, I'm a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children would be.
s07_e19_c12_u176	Hi!
s07_e19_c12_u177	Hi!
s07_e19_c12_u178	How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of women.) Hi, thanks for coming.
s07_e19_c12_u179	Oh thank you.
s07_e19_c12_u180	Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to another pairing.) Oh, it's so nice to see you.
s07_e19_c12_u181	No.
s07_e19_c12_u182	No thanks.
s07_e19_c12_u183	Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
s07_e19_c12_u184	Yeah?
s07_e19_c12_u185	Who the hell are all these people?
s07_e19_c12_u186	Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
s07_e19_c12_u187	Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
s07_e19_c12_u188	(to her) Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
s07_e19_c12_u189	I was her accountant four years ago.
s07_e19_c12_u190	Ohhhh!
s07_e19_c12_u191	I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
s07_e19_c12_u192	That's great!
s07_e19_c12_u193	So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
s07_e19_c12_u194	(to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You didn't tell her to come?!
s07_e19_c12_u195	You were supposed to tell her!
s07_e19_c12_u196	No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
s07_e19_c12_u197	Fine, I'll go call her.
s07_e19_c12_u198	Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
s07_e19_c13_u199	Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
s07_e19_c13_u200	Wow! This looks great!
s07_e19_c13_u201	Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is made of bologna. (Points.)
s07_e19_c13_u202	And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
s07_e19_c13_u203	Oh, just until the glue dries.
s07_e19_c13_u204	Thank God!
s07_e19_c13_u205	(to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
s07_e19_c13_u206	Ah.
s07_e19_c13_u207	Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
s07_e19_c13_u208	Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)
s07_e19_c13_u209	I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
s07_e19_c13_u210	Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
s07_e19_c13_u211	Ow!
s07_e19_c13_u212	Toothpick?
s07_e19_c13_u213	Yeah.
s07_e19_c13_u214	What are you trying on now?
s07_e19_c13_u215	The fruit roll up.
s07_e19_c13_u216	And?
s07_e19_c13_u217	Delicious.
s07_e19_c13_u218	Joey!
s07_e19_c13_u219	Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
s07_e19_c13_u220	What?! Which one?!
s07_e19_c13_u221	The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
s07_e19_c14_u222	(in his head) She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! (She grabs some popcorn.) Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. (She grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
s07_e19_c14_u223	Hey! What the hell are you doing?! (They sit back up.)
s07_e19_c14_u224	(in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause) There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To her) I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his head) Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
s07_e19_c15_u225	Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.) Oh.
s07_e19_c15_u226	Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
s07_e19_c15_u227	For what?
s07_e19_c15_u228	Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
s07_e19_c15_u229	And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
s07_e19_c15_u230	You al-you already had it?
s07_e19_c15_u231	Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
s07_e19_c15_u232	Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
s07_e19_c15_u233	We ruined everything.
s07_e19_c15_u234	Ugh
s07_e19_c15_u235	Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
s07_e19_c15_u236	What do you, what do you mean?
s07_e19_c15_u237	Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk to people I don't even like!
s07_e19_c15_u238	Surprise
s07_e19_c15_u239	Sur-surprise.
s07_e19_c15_u240	Monica.
s07_e19_c16_u241	And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
s07_e19_c16_u242	Yeah.
s07_e19_c16_u243	My whole family's from Naples!
s07_e19_c16_u244	Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie
s07_e19_c16_u245	Joey, this is awkward part.
s07_e19_c16_u246	Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands back up and looks down.) So there you go, that's me. (We cut to a camera angle looking at the casting director and movie director through Joey's legs.) One hundred percent natural! (Suddenly, there's a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.
s07_e19_c17_u247	Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
s07_e19_c17_u248	Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
s07_e19_c17_u249	Oh! No problem! I- (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping thing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official website at www.deniserichards.com.)
s07_e19_c17_u250	(noticing her) What?
s07_e19_c17_u251	(in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
s09_e02_c01_u001	You said you'd marry Joey?
s09_e02_c01_u002	Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I'm not helping.
s09_e02_c01_u003	So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
s09_e02_c01_u004	That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
s09_e02_c01_u005	So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
s09_e02_c01_u006	Well-Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
s09_e02_c01_u007	Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, but Joey's my-No! Ah! (points at Rachel)
s09_e02_c01_u008	Ooooo!
s09_e02_c01_u009	(Enters) Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
s09_e02_c01_u010	Rachel said she'd marry you?!
s09_e02_c01_u011	(He looks around the room) This isn't the right room, sorry folks. (leaves)
s09_e02_c02_u012	Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
s09_e02_c02_u013	No they ran out of "It's a girl" but I can fix this one, (She writes "not" in between it's and a) See?
s09_e02_c02_u014	(looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy. (Waking him up.) Honey.
s09_e02_c02_u015	Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
s09_e02_c02_u016	Honey why don't you go lie down.
s09_e02_c02_u017	No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?
s09_e02_c02_u018	Why're you so tired?
s09_e02_c02_u019	Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
s09_e02_c02_u020	You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story.
s09_e02_c02_u021	(enters with Emma) Hi!
s09_e02_c02_u022	Hi, welcome home!
s09_e02_c02_u023	Phoebe did the signs!
s09_e02_c02_u024	Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
s09_e02_c02_u025	Look at all the stuff people sent!
s09_e02_c02_u026	Oh Ah! (Sees a big stuffed gorilla) Oh my gosh there's something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think- (Reads the card) Oh you guys I love it.
s09_e02_c02_u027	Hey so where's Ross?
s09_e02_c02_u028	He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
s09_e02_c02_u029	Is he still mad at us?
s09_e02_c02_u030	Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
s09_e02_c02_u031	That's not fair! I can't do that.
s09_e02_c02_u032	Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
s09_e02_c02_u033	See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he'd be over it by now.
s09_e02_c02_u034	Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
s09_e02_c03_u035	The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.
s09_e02_c03_u036	Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you I'll go straight to my forty two point plan.
s09_e02_c03_u037	Walter (nods).
s09_e02_c04_u038	She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
s09_e02_c04_u039	Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
s09_e02_c04_u040	(enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.
s09_e02_c04_u041	Oh great, the pacifiers?
s09_e02_c04_u042	In the closet.
s09_e02_c04_u043	The burping clogs?
s09_e02_c04_u044	Linen closet.
s09_e02_c04_u045	The diapers?
s09_e02_c04_u046	In the hospital.
s09_e02_c04_u047	Wow you guys got a hospital? Fancy!
s09_e02_c04_u048	No I left the diapers at the hospital! There's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
s09_e02_c04_u049	Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
s09_e02_c04_u050	Sure what kind?
s09_e02_c04_u051	Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
s09_e02_c04_u052	Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
s09_e02_c04_u053	Blueberry.
s09_e02_c04_u054	Blueberry it is.
s09_e02_c04_u055	Thanks.
s09_e02_c04_u056	Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?
s09_e02_c04_u057	God how long do you think that's gonna last?
s09_e02_c04_u058	I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.
s09_e02_c04_u059	Y'know I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.
s09_e02_c04_u060	You know that's- that's her.
s09_e02_c04_u061	Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I'm gonna wake her up.
s09_e02_c04_u062	Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
s09_e02_c04_u063	Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! (Waking Emma up.) Come on little girl, hi!
s09_e02_c04_u064	I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.
s09_e02_c04_u065	Oh I'm sorry mummy's so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh. Shhh! Go back to sleep
s09_e02_c04_u066	Breaks your heart doesn't it
s09_e02_c04_u067	It really does- how long do you think we have to stay?
s09_e02_c05_u068	Ok if everyone's on board, it's settled, Chandler, (Walter puts his hand on Chandlers hand, Chandler sleeping puts his hand on top of his, he then wakes up and pulls his hand away) Chandler?
s09_e02_c05_u069	Yep.
s09_e02_c05_u070	Are you on board?
s09_e02_c05_u071	(not knowing what he's saying yes to) Yes.
s09_e02_c05_u072	Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa. You're gonna love Oklahoma.
s09_e02_c06_u073	Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
s09_e02_c06_u074	Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
s09_e02_c06_u075	Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)
s09_e02_c06_u076	It worked!
s09_e02_c06_u077	Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts crying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won't stop crying.
s09_e02_c06_u078	Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
s09_e02_c06_u079	Yeah, I'm not so sure.
s09_e02_c06_u080	Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
s09_e02_c06_u081	Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
s09_e02_c07_u082	Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag with diapers in it on the counter.)
s09_e02_c07_u083	Diapers huh?
s09_e02_c07_u084	Yep.
s09_e02_c07_u085	So I guess Rachel had you baby?
s09_e02_c07_u086	Yep, can you believe it?
s09_e02_c07_u087	Nope! I still can't believe she slept with you in the first place.
s09_e02_c07_u088	Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a- Huh?
s09_e02_c07_u089	(entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it's Joey he just ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
s09_e02_c07_u090	(turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn't do anything wrong?!
s09_e02_c07_u091	I said I didn't technically.
s09_e02_c07_u092	Okay let's put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again) "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
s09_e02_c07_u093	Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don't really know what that means. (Ross just looks at him) You were saying?
s09_e02_c07_u094	And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.
s09_e02_c07_u095	I know I should've. (Makes quote marks again.) "I'm sorry."
s09_e02_c07_u096	Not using it right, Joe.
s09_e02_c07_u097	I'm gonna go.
s09_e02_c07_u098	No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can't leave) Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
s09_e02_c07_u099	Give me the bag.
s09_e02_c07_u100	No, look, I don't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry!
s09_e02_c07_u101	Joey!
s09_e02_c07_u102	You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
s09_e02_c07_u103	I'm not gonna hit you.
s09_e02_c07_u104	Why not? You'll feel better! I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
s09_e02_c07_u105	No I don't.
s09_e02_c07_u106	A little bit.
s09_e02_c07_u107	No.
s09_e02_c07_u108	Little bit.
s09_e02_c07_u109	No!
s09_e02_c07_u110	(excited) A little bit more.
s09_e02_c07_u111	Give me the bag.
s09_e02_c07_u112	No, hit me
s09_e02_c07_u113	Give me the bag.
s09_e02_c07_u114	Hit me.
s09_e02_c07_u115	Joey, give me the bag.
s09_e02_c07_u116	Hit me!
s09_e02_c07_u117	Joe I'm not kidding
s09_e02_c07_u118	(interrupting) Hit me, hit me.
s09_e02_c07_u119	No!
s09_e02_c07_u120	(shouts) Hit me! Hit me!
s09_e02_c07_u121	You ducked!!
s09_e02_c07_u122	I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
s09_e02_c07_u123	Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
s09_e02_c07_u124	I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn't and Joey punches Ross. Gunther is amused.)
s09_e02_c07_u125	What is the matter with you?!?
s09_e02_c07_u126	You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
s09_e02_c07_u127	Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
s09_e02_c07_u128	Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes quote marks.) "Oops."
s09_e02_c08_u129	Try feeding her again.
s09_e02_c08_u130	I already fed her.
s09_e02_c08_u131	I know, that's why I said again!
s09_e02_c08_u132	Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay? That's just what she wants.
s09_e02_c08_u133	(enters) Hey.
s09_e02_c08_u134	Hey.
s09_e02_c08_u135	Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
s09_e02_c08_u136	Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I'm gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
s09_e02_c08_u137	Oh I'm kinda part of this.
s09_e02_c08_u138	Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
s09_e02_c08_u139	I knew I should have married Chandler.
s09_e02_c08_u140	Okay what's up
s09_e02_c08_u141	Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
s09_e02_c08_u142	Oh yeah (smiles).
s09_e02_c08_u143	Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
s09_e02_c08_u144	What? Who says that?
s09_e02_c08_u145	People who've never ever been to Paris.
s09_e02_c08_u146	What's going on?
s09_e02_c08_u147	We're moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)
s09_e02_c08_u148	Excuse me?
s09_e02_c08_u149	Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
s09_e02_c08_u150	(stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!
s09_e02_c08_u151	The Sooner State, whatever that is.
s09_e02_c08_u152	Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
s09_e02_c08_u153	Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
s09_e02_c08_u154	Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
s09_e02_c08_u155	No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica's not impressed.) I'll get out of it.
s09_e02_c08_u156	Thank you.
s09_e02_c08_u157	(hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?
s09_e02_c08_u158	Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
s09_e02_c09_u159	Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
s09_e02_c09_u160	What?
s09_e02_c09_u161	It's a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying.
s09_e02_c09_u162	You fell asleep?
s09_e02_c09_u163	But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!
s09_e02_c09_u164	Chandler, I
s09_e02_c09_u165	No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at him.) That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)
s09_e02_c10_u166	Hey, so how is it?
s09_e02_c10_u167	I broke my thumb.
s09_e02_c10_u168	Your thumb? That's weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure you're punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
s09_e02_c10_u169	You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to hold the pen but can't)
s09_e02_c10_u170	You, you want me to help you with that?
s09_e02_c10_u171	Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He hands Joey the form)
s09_e02_c10_u172	Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but what's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
s09_e02_c10_u173	Just Ross!
s09_e02_c10_u174	It's pretty, Okay date of birth?
s09_e02_c10_u175	You know my birthday.
s09_e02_c10_u176	Sure, May...tember.
s09_e02_c10_u177	October 18th.
s09_e02_c10_u178	Occupation? Dinosaurs.
s09_e02_c10_u179	Actually I'm a palian- Dinosaurs is fine- the drawing is not.
s09_e02_c10_u180	Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
s09_e02_c10_u181	Ah, Rachel I guess.
s09_e02_c10_u182	Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
s09_e02_c10_u183	Just ah- just put roommate.
s09_e02_c10_u184	Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you're gonna get together right?
s09_e02_c10_u185	I don't think that we are.
s09_e02_c10_u186	But you two were supposed to be together.
s09_e02_c10_u187	Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you.
s09_e02_c10_u188	Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
s09_e02_c10_u189	Yeah that's what she said.
s09_e02_c10_u190	So?
s09_e02_c10_u191	So I don't wanna be just anybody.
s09_e02_c10_u192	Wow.
s09_e02_c10_u193	You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
s09_e02_c10_u194	Really?
s09_e02_c10_u195	Yeah.
s09_e02_c10_u196	And you're Okay with that?
s09_e02_c10_u197	Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That's why they call them plans. Hello? (Pause) I'm fine.
s09_e02_c10_u198	Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."
s09_e02_c10_u199	Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)
s09_e02_c10_u200	(makes quote marks) "Thanks."
s09_e02_c11_u201	Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
s09_e02_c11_u202	About a week and a half.
s09_e02_c11_u203	Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I'm just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)
s09_e02_c11_u204	Rach, try holding her a different way.
s09_e02_c11_u205	You guys, I'm doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
s09_e02_c11_u206	Alright, I'll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
s09_e02_c11_u207	Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)
s09_e02_c11_u208	Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)
s09_e02_c11_u209	Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can't even comfort my own baby! I'm the worst mother ever!
s09_e02_c11_u210	You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out.
s09_e02_c11_u211	Yeah I don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
s09_e02_c11_u212	Okay I'll take her, here. (Takes Emma)
s09_e02_c11_u213	I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)
s09_e02_c11_u214	I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)
s09_e02_c11_u215	(To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)
s09_e02_c11_u216	(entering) Have I gone deaf?
s09_e02_c11_u217	It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
s09_e02_c11_u218	You must be a fireball in bed.
s09_e02_c11_u219	I can't believe it! She's asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
s09_e02_c11_u220	I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! (Monica looks at her strangely) I'm kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)
s09_e02_c11_u221	Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
s09_e02_c11_u222	Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt
s09_e02_c11_u223	You are the official baby crier stopper!
s09_e02_c11_u224	Yes I am!!
s09_e02_c11_u225	You're never leaving the apartment!
s09_e02_c11_u226	Say what?
s09_e02_c11_u227	That's your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.
s09_e02_c11_u228	(stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!
s09_e02_c11_u229	Thankfully you don't need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let's give it six to eight months (she leaves).
s09_e02_c11_u230	Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
s09_e02_c11_u231	What?
s09_e02_c11_u232	You know the book says that whenever she's sleeping I should be sleeping so- (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)
s09_e02_c11_u233	(entering, loudly) Hey!
s09_e02_c11_u234	Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
s09_e02_c11_u235	Oh so there can't be any yelling.
s09_e02_c11_u236	No.
s09_e02_c11_u237	We're moving to Tulsa
s09_e02_c11_u238	(loudly) What!?
s09_e02_c11_u239	Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I can't, I can't hear you. (He runs out)
s09_e02_c12_u240	Hey.
s09_e02_c12_u241	Heeeeey, where have you been? (He shows her his thumb) What happened to you?
s09_e02_c12_u242	Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
s09_e02_c12_u243	Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
s09_e02_c12_u244	Okay.
s09_e02_c12_u245	You know what I really really want?
s09_e02_c12_u246	What, Rach?
s09_e02_c12_u247	I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
s09_e02_c12_u248	(smiles) Right.
s09_e02_c12_u249	I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.
s09_e02_c12_u250	Well, that's what I'm here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want me to get that?
s09_e02_c12_u251	No its really okay- Monica!
s09_e02_c12_u252	(comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
s09_e02_c13_u253	You know, ah, I've been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it's not my fault. It's a natural instinct.
s09_e02_c13_u254	(enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?
s09_e02_c13_u255	Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler, he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up and just stares at Joey.)
s01_e20_c01_u001	No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
s01_e20_c01_u002	I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
s01_e20_c01_u003	(looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
s01_e20_c01_u004	I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
s01_e20_c01_u005	Oh, that is so sick.
s01_e20_c01_u006	I feel violated. And not in a good way.
s01_e20_c01_u007	How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
s01_e20_c02_u008	I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
s01_e20_c02_u009	So have you called her yet?
s01_e20_c02_u010	Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?
s01_e20_c02_u011	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
s01_e20_c02_u012	I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
s01_e20_c02_u013	Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
s01_e20_c02_u014	Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
s01_e20_c02_u015	Her answer machine?
s01_e20_c02_u016	No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
s01_e20_c02_u017	So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
s01_e20_c02_u018	Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
s01_e20_c02_u019	Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
s01_e20_c02_u020	Okay, okay, what's going on?
s01_e20_c02_u021	Okay, they're just talking...
s01_e20_c02_u022	Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
s01_e20_c02_u023	No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
s01_e20_c02_u024	What? What? What?!
s01_e20_c02_u025	That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!
s01_e20_c02_u026	(bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
s01_e20_c02_u027	Oh!... Right!
s01_e20_c02_u028	Hey Rach!
s01_e20_c02_u029	How'd it go?
s01_e20_c02_u030	Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
s01_e20_c02_u031	Not a good day for birds...
s01_e20_c02_u032	Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
s01_e20_c02_u033	That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
s01_e20_c02_u034	Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
s01_e20_c02_u035	That's, that's nice twice!
s01_e20_c02_u036	Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
s01_e20_c02_u037	Duh, where've you been?
s01_e20_c02_u038	Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
s01_e20_c02_u039	Yes!
s01_e20_c02_u040	Why?
s01_e20_c02_u041	I have my reasons.
s01_e20_c02_u042	Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
s01_e20_c02_u043	All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
s01_e20_c03_u044	Wow... Wow!
s01_e20_c03_u045	Yeah.
s01_e20_c03_u046	I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.
s01_e20_c03_u047	Nooo, it wasn't.
s01_e20_c03_u048	Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...
s01_e20_c04_u049	(on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
s01_e20_c04_u050	That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
s01_e20_c04_u051	Hey, I've been honing!
s01_e20_c04_u052	What was with the dishes?
s01_e20_c04_u053	Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
s01_e20_c04_u054	(looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
s01_e20_c04_u055	Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking in here!
s01_e20_c04_u056	Great, now he's waving back.
s01_e20_c04_u057	Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
s01_e20_c04_u058	What kinda stuff?
s01_e20_c04_u059	Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
s01_e20_c04_u060	You cook naked?
s01_e20_c04_u061	Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
s01_e20_c04_u062	What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
s01_e20_c05_u063	What's the matter?
s01_e20_c05_u064	Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
s01_e20_c05_u065	No, it was. It was very very good.
s01_e20_c05_u066	Well, what about Mindy?
s01_e20_c05_u067	Oh, way, way better than Mindy.
s01_e20_c05_u068	No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
s01_e20_c05_u069	Well, if you want, I'll just-I'll just break it off with her.
s01_e20_c05_u070	No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
s01_e20_c05_u071	(over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
s01_e20_c05_u072	(into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend.
s01_e20_c05_u073	Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
s01_e20_c05_u074	We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.
s01_e20_c05_u075	I had a bra.
s01_e20_c05_u076	Hey, Dr. Farber.
s01_e20_c05_u077	All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
s01_e20_c05_u078	What?!
s01_e20_c05_u079	I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
s01_e20_c06_u080	Can I use your phone?
s01_e20_c06_u081	Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
s01_e20_c06_u082	Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
s01_e20_c06_u083	Maybe she never got your message.
s01_e20_c06_u084	Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
s01_e20_c06_u085	Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
s01_e20_c06_u086	...desperate, needy, pathetic?
s01_e20_c06_u087	Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
s01_e20_c06_u088	How many beeps?
s01_e20_c06_u089	She answered.
s01_e20_c06_u090	Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
s01_e20_c06_u091	I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
s01_e20_c06_u092	Hey! Hi!
s01_e20_c06_u093	How'd he take it?
s01_e20_c06_u094	Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)
s01_e20_c06_u095	(wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
s01_e20_c06_u096	Oh, do I?
s01_e20_c06_u097	Uh huh.
s01_e20_c06_u098	(in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair.
s01_e20_c06_u099	You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
s01_e20_c06_u100	You-you had what?
s01_e20_c06_u101	Sex in his chair.
s01_e20_c06_u102	What, uh... what were you thinking?
s01_e20_c06_u103	I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
s01_e20_c06_u104	No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
s01_e20_c06_u105	Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
s01_e20_c06_u106	If it helps, I could slide over.
s01_e20_c06_u107	It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
s01_e20_c06_u108	Where are you going?
s01_e20_c06_u109	(leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
s01_e20_c06_u110	Hello? Hello?
s01_e20_c06_u111	(on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Great... (Listens) Great... (Listens) All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! (Listens) Okay.. (Listens) Okay... (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up and sits down heavily.) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
s01_e20_c06_u112	So how's Mindy?
s01_e20_c06_u113	Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (Does so, on phone) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
s01_e20_c07_u114	Brrrrrrr!
s01_e20_c07_u115	Hell is filled with people like you.
s01_e20_c07_u116	(entering) He's back! The peeper's back!
s01_e20_c07_u117	(ducking) Get down!
s01_e20_c07_u118	Get down?
s01_e20_c07_u119	...And boogie!
s01_e20_c07_u120	Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
s01_e20_c07_u121	Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
s01_e20_c07_u122	Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
s01_e20_c07_u123	(intrigued) Yeah?
s01_e20_c07_u124	And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
s01_e20_c07_u125	..Naughty!
s01_e20_c07_u126	Right, I'll see you guys later...
s01_e20_c07_u127	Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah...
s01_e20_c07_u128	Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
s01_e20_c07_u129	Why don't you just take it with you?
s01_e20_c07_u130	Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
s01_e20_c07_u131	Why don't you just call her?
s01_e20_c07_u132	I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
s01_e20_c07_u133	Do you?
s01_e20_c07_u134	No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
s01_e20_c07_u135	Don't you have to pee?
s01_e20_c07_u136	'S'why I'm dancing...
s01_e20_c08_u137	Mindy.
s01_e20_c08_u138	Hey, you.
s01_e20_c08_u139	Hey, you.... So, what's up?
s01_e20_c08_u140	Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
s01_e20_c08_u141	Sure we should... So.
s01_e20_c08_u142	Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
s01_e20_c08_u143	Okay.
s01_e20_c08_u144	Will you be my maid of honour?
s01_e20_c08_u145	Of course!
s01_e20_c08_u146	Oh that's so great!
s01_e20_c08_u147	Was that all you wanted to ask me?
s01_e20_c08_u148	That's all!
s01_e20_c08_u149	Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?
s01_e20_c08_u150	That's not all.
s01_e20_c08_u151	Oh sure it is!
s01_e20_c08_u152	Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
s01_e20_c08_u153	Um, what- what would make you think that?
s01_e20_c08_u154	Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
s01_e20_c08_u155	(draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
s01_e20_c08_u156	Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
s01_e20_c08_u157	What? What's what you were afraid of?
s01_e20_c08_u158	Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
s01_e20_c08_u159	What?
s01_e20_c08_u160	I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
s01_e20_c08_u161	Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
s01_e20_c08_u162	What do you mean?
s01_e20_c08_u163	(offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?
s01_e20_c08_u164	Oh no.
s01_e20_c08_u165	Oh, I am so sorry.
s01_e20_c08_u166	No me, I am so sorry...
s01_e20_c08_u167	(watches them for a while) Oh my.
s01_e20_c09_u168	Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
s01_e20_c09_u169	Ring dammit, ring!
s01_e20_c09_u170	Thanks.
s01_e20_c09_u171	(entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?
s01_e20_c09_u172	What?!
s01_e20_c09_u173	I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
s01_e20_c09_u174	(investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
s01_e20_c09_u175	Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Just pointing out the irony.
s01_e20_c09_u176	Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
s01_e20_c09_u177	Nngghhh!!!!!!!
s01_e20_c09_u178	(to Monica) Can I use your phone? (On phone) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
s01_e20_c09_u179	"Heating device."
s01_e20_c09_u180	Radiator.
s01_e20_c09_u181	Five letters.
s01_e20_c09_u182	Rdtor.
s01_e20_c09_u183	(on phone) Yeah, is Sidney there? (Listens) Oh, this is? (To the gang) Sidney's a woman.
s01_e20_c09_u184	So she's a woman! So what?
s01_e20_c09_u185	Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walking to the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like-(Listens)-Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) The point is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally..
s01_e20_c09_u186	Joey!!
s01_e20_c09_u187	(on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (to Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
s01_e20_c09_u188	The green dress? Really?
s01_e20_c09_u189	Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
s01_e20_c09_u190	(waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!
s01_e20_c10_u191	Hey. Got a second?
s01_e20_c10_u192	Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in...
s01_e20_c10_u193	Hello, sweetheart.
s01_e20_c10_u194	Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
s01_e20_c10_u195	Uh, we are here to break up with you.
s01_e20_c10_u196	Both of you?
s01_e20_c10_u197	Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
s01_e20_c10_u198	I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
s01_e20_c10_u199	Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
s01_e20_c10_u200	....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
s01_e20_c10_u201	Even when we were having sex in that chair?
s01_e20_c10_u202	(to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
s01_e20_c10_u203	Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
s01_e20_c10_u204	(to Rachel) You did it twice?
s01_e20_c10_u205	Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
s01_e20_c10_u206	Okay...
s01_e20_c10_u207	(to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
s01_e20_c10_u208	(over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
s01_e20_c10_u209	Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
s01_e20_c10_u210	Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
s01_e20_c10_u211	Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
s01_e20_c10_u212	What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
s01_e20_c10_u213	Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
s01_e20_c10_u214	Oh God.
s01_e20_c10_u215	I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
s01_e20_c10_u216	And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
s01_e20_c11_u217	You okay?
s01_e20_c11_u218	Yeah.
s01_e20_c11_u219	Really?
s01_e20_c11_u220	Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
s01_e20_c11_u221	Aww... (They hug)
s01_e20_c11_u222	Big day.
s01_e20_c12_u223	All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
s01_e20_c12_u224	You know he's gay?
s01_e20_c12_u225	I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
s01_e20_c12_u226	Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
s01_e20_c12_u227	Hi. Hi.
s01_e20_c12_u228	What are you doing here?
s01_e20_c12_u229	...I'm, I'm okay.
s01_e20_c12_u230	That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
s01_e20_c12_u231	Okay.
s01_e20_c12_u232	Bye.
s01_e20_c12_u233	Whoo-hoo!
s01_e20_c12_u234	Yeah, there you go!
s01_e20_c12_u235	Second date!
s01_e20_c12_u236	...I dunno.
s01_e20_c12_u237	You don't know?!
s01_e20_c12_u238	Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
s06_e19_c01_u001	Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and shocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
s06_e19_c01_u002	Hi Joey, how ya doin'?
s06_e19_c01_u003	Great! Roomie!
s06_e19_c01_u004	Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
s06_e19_c01_u005	Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
s06_e19_c01_u006	I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
s06_e19_c01_u007	Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?
s06_e19_c01_u008	That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
s06_e19_c01_u009	All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred.
s06_e19_c01_u010	You're jokin' right?
s06_e19_c01_u011	Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
s06_e19_c01_u012	Thank God you're pretty. (Exits.)
s06_e19_c02_u013	Hey!
s06_e19_c02_u014	Hi! Hey!
s06_e19_c02_u015	Do you guys know any cute guys?
s06_e19_c02_u016	Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey's arm, Joey pats Chandler's shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same about him.)
s06_e19_c02_u017	Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler.
s06_e19_c02_u018	Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go
s06_e19_c02_u019	What's the charity?
s06_e19_c02_u020	I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.
s06_e19_c02_u021	Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
s06_e19_c02_u022	Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
s06_e19_c02_u023	Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
s06_e19_c02_u024	Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
s06_e19_c02_u025	So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
s06_e19_c02_u026	Ooh! So close.
s06_e19_c02_u027	Hey everybody!
s06_e19_c02_u028	Hi!
s06_e19_c02_u029	Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.
s06_e19_c02_u030	Oh hi!
s06_e19_c02_u031	Hi!
s06_e19_c02_u032	I'm the student.
s06_e19_c02_u033	(laughs) Isn't she cute? (On Monica's death stare) No!
s06_e19_c02_u034	Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
s06_e19_c02_u035	Oh, we're not together.
s06_e19_c02_u036	Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)
s06_e19_c02_u037	Oh, sly.
s06_e19_c02_u038	Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I'll see you later?
s06_e19_c02_u039	Okay!
s06_e19_c02_u040	Bye Ross.
s06_e19_c02_u041	Bye.
s06_e19_c02_u042	Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.
s06_e19_c02_u043	Oh that is quite all right ma'am. (Elizabeth exits.)
s06_e19_c02_u044	So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
s06_e19_c02_u045	Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
s06_e19_c02_u046	Oh, tell her good luck with that.
s06_e19_c02_u047	Anyone else? Huh? Bring em on!
s06_e19_c02_u048	Oo! When's her birthday?!
s06_e19_c02_u049	I don't know Rachel, why?
s06_e19_c02_u050	Well, y'know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuckie Cheese.
s06_e19_c02_u051	Oh, I like Elizabeth.
s06_e19_c02_u052	Well thanks!
s06_e19_c02_u053	Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
s06_e19_c02_u054	Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
s06_e19_c02_u055	Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
s06_e19_c02_u056	Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
s06_e19_c02_u057	Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are
s06_e19_c02_u058	(interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?
s06_e19_c03_u059	Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
s06_e19_c03_u060	Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
s06_e19_c03_u061	(entering) Hey!
s06_e19_c03_u062	Hey!
s06_e19_c03_u063	Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
s06_e19_c03_u064	Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
s06_e19_c03_u065	Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
s06_e19_c03_u066	Why would our guy be a weirdo?
s06_e19_c03_u067	Cause that's just your taste.
s06_e19_c03_u068	(laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
s06_e19_c03_u069	Oh yeah?
s06_e19_c03_u070	Yeah!
s06_e19_c03_u071	My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She squeezes the skin on her chin together to form-)
s06_e19_c03_u072	A face ass?
s06_e19_c03_u073	A chin dimple!
s06_e19_c03_u074	Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!
s06_e19_c03_u075	Have you seen your guy's body?
s06_e19_c03_u076	No, our guy is just a floating head.
s06_e19_c03_u077	Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
s06_e19_c03_u078	You're not supposed to look!
s06_e19_c03_u079	Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
s06_e19_c03_u080	(horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
s06_e19_c03_u081	I know. (Laughs.)
s06_e19_c03_u082	All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
s06_e19_c03_u083	Oh, Chandler funny?
s06_e19_c03_u084	Our guy's a great dancer!
s06_e19_c03_u085	My guy is well read.
s06_e19_c03_u086	Our guy has great hair.
s06_e19_c03_u087	My guy has great teeth!
s06_e19_c03_u088	Our guy smells incredible.
s06_e19_c03_u089	(To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?
s06_e19_c04_u090	Hey.
s06_e19_c04_u091	Huh.
s06_e19_c04_u092	Well, you-don't look good Joe.
s06_e19_c04_u093	The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
s06_e19_c04_u094	That's still in there?!
s06_e19_c04_u095	Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
s06_e19_c04_u096	Is this a service you're providing me?
s06_e19_c04_u097	No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
s06_e19_c04_u098	Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
s06_e19_c04_u099	So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
s06_e19_c04_u100	Uh-huh.
s06_e19_c04_u101	And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
s06_e19_c04_u102	(not quite sure where Joey's going and is a little worried) Okay
s06_e19_c04_u103	(pause) Give me $400!
s06_e19_c05_u104	Professor Geller?
s06_e19_c05_u105	Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don't know.
s06_e19_c05_u106	I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
s06_e19_c05_u107	Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
s06_e19_c05_u108	Making out in your office.
s06_e19_c05_u109	Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don't we go inside?
s06_e19_c05_u110	Oh-ooh!
s06_e19_c05_u111	What?
s06_e19_c05_u112	Doorknob! Doorknob!
s06_e19_c05_u113	Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.
s06_e19_c05_u114	Oh, okay. What-what about?
s06_e19_c05_u115	Spring vacation.
s06_e19_c05_u116	Spring vacation.
s06_e19_c05_u117	Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips
s06_e19_c05_u118	(quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger- I'll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)
s06_e19_c06_u119	You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
s06_e19_c06_u120	Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
s06_e19_c06_u121	I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
s06_e19_c06_u122	Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
s06_e19_c06_u123	Or! You can just, y'know- (He walks up close to whisper in Ross's ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)
s06_e19_c06_u124	What the hell are you doing?
s06_e19_c06_u125	What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
s06_e19_c06_u126	What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!
s06_e19_c06_u127	Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! (He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!
s06_e19_c06_u128	Joey, I saw you push him!
s06_e19_c06_u129	(pause) You pushed him!
s06_e19_c06_u130	Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.
s06_e19_c06_u131	All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
s06_e19_c06_u132	Uh-huh.
s06_e19_c06_u133	I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
s06_e19_c06_u134	Do not give him any money!
s06_e19_c06_u135	I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
s06_e19_c07_u136	You wanted to see me Professor Geller?
s06_e19_c07_u137	Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
s06_e19_c07_u138	Oo-oo!
s06_e19_c07_u139	Doorknob?
s06_e19_c07_u140	Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
s06_e19_c07_u141	Oh good.
s06_e19_c07_u142	Look, I- (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon.
s06_e19_c07_u143	Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
s06_e19_c07_u144	No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was
s06_e19_c07_u145	You are so adorable.
s06_e19_c07_u146	That! Let's talk about that.
s06_e19_c08_u147	Hey!
s06_e19_c08_u148	Hey!
s06_e19_c08_u149	Hey!
s06_e19_c08_u150	Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
s06_e19_c08_u151	Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
s06_e19_c08_u152	Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)
s06_e19_c08_u153	What's-what's the difference?
s06_e19_c08_u154	Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys.
s06_e19_c08_u155	Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
s06_e19_c08_u156	What did you do on yours?
s06_e19_c08_u157	I went to Egypt with my dad.
s06_e19_c08_u158	I can see it now, "Look dad, it's the Sphinx!" (Does that party noise again.)
s06_e19_c08_u159	Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she's taken my class!
s06_e19_c08_u160	And slept with the professor.
s06_e19_c08_u161	I'm gonna call her.
s06_e19_c08_u162	Yeah.
s06_e19_c08_u163	Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
s06_e19_c08_u164	Hi.
s06_e19_c08_u165	We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. (Chandler's shocked.) What? I read that.
s06_e19_c08_u166	Can I get you a cup of coffee?
s06_e19_c08_u167	Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)
s06_e19_c08_u168	Rachel, what the hell is this?!
s06_e19_c08_u169	(shocked) What?
s06_e19_c08_u170	You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
s06_e19_c08_u171	You found me a guy?
s06_e19_c08_u172	Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
s06_e19_c08_u173	Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
s06_e19_c08_u174	Well, y'know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
s06_e19_c08_u175	Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
s06_e19_c08_u176	Uh, would you stop it with that already?!
s06_e19_c08_u177	Here you go. (Hands her, her cup.)
s06_e19_c08_u178	Oh, thank you.
s06_e19_c08_u179	Sure.
s06_e19_c08_u180	So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
s06_e19_c08_u181	Uh, no not really. Why?
s06_e19_c08_u182	No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
s06_e19_c08_u183	Are you funny?
s06_e19_c08_u184	Excuse me?
s06_e19_c08_u185	What are you guys doing?
s06_e19_c08_u186	Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
s06_e19_c08_u187	Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
s06_e19_c08_u188	Well, so do a lot of people.
s06_e19_c08_u189	Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. (To Rachel) Give me a call sometime.
s06_e19_c08_u190	Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number.
s06_e19_c08_u191	Okay! See you later! (Exits.)
s06_e19_c08_u192	(To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.
s06_e19_c09_u193	I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
s06_e19_c09_u194	Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?
s06_e19_c09_u195	Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" (Imitates him.) "Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"
s06_e19_c09_u196	All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
s06_e19_c09_u197	Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.
s06_e19_c09_u198	All right.
s06_e19_c09_u199	Okay, so you will meet our guys?
s06_e19_c09_u200	Yes, I'll meet em.
s06_e19_c09_u201	Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
s06_e19_c09_u202	(entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
s06_e19_c09_u203	Okay sure!
s06_e19_c09_u204	Really?!
s06_e19_c09_u205	Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
s06_e19_c09_u206	Call it even?
s06_e19_c09_u207	Okay.
s06_e19_c09_u208	(To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
s06_e19_c09_u209	Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know
s06_e19_c09_u210	Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
s06_e19_c09_u211	You know the hotels?
s06_e19_c09_u212	Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
s06_e19_c09_u213	In 1981 you were 13!
s06_e19_c09_u214	So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
s06_e19_c09_u215	Okay, she can't go.
s06_e19_c09_u216	Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
s06_e19_c09_u217	Then what am I supposed to do?
s06_e19_c09_u218	Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
s06_e19_c09_u219	Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
s06_e19_c09_u220	Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
s06_e19_c10_u221	I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
s06_e19_c10_u222	Yeah! I've been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y'know, blow off some steam.
s06_e19_c10_u223	Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
s06_e19_c10_u224	What?
s06_e19_c10_u225	Are you into crafts at all?
s06_e19_c10_u226	Ross, are you okay?
s06_e19_c10_u227	Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what is uh, what's this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
s06_e19_c10_u228	It's a bathing suit?
s06_e19_c10_u229	To wear in front of people?
s06_e19_c10_u230	Is that supportive?
s06_e19_c10_u231	Is this?!
s06_e19_c11_u232	Hey!
s06_e19_c11_u233	Good-good-good-good.
s06_e19_c11_u234	Hey!
s06_e19_c11_u235	Hey!
s06_e19_c11_u236	Hi!
s06_e19_c11_u237	We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
s06_e19_c11_u238	Oh
s06_e19_c11_u239	You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?
s06_e19_c11_u240	I don't know. I know I don't work late tomorrow night.
s06_e19_c11_u241	Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)
s06_e19_c11_u242	What?
s06_e19_c11_u243	Eldad, this is Rachel.
s06_e19_c11_u244	How are you?
s06_e19_c11_u245	Well-well a little blind sided but y'know good.
s06_e19_c11_u246	Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!
s06_e19_c11_u247	I-Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)
s06_e19_c11_u248	There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)
s06_e19_c11_u249	Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!
s06_e19_c11_u250	This is Patrick. (Points to him.)
s06_e19_c11_u251	Hi.
s06_e19_c11_u252	Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy.
s06_e19_c11_u253	(looks) Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.) Rachel?
s06_e19_c11_u254	Yeah?
s06_e19_c11_u255	This is Patrick.
s06_e19_c11_u256	Oh, hi.
s06_e19_c11_u257	Hi.
s06_e19_c11_u258	Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.
s06_e19_c11_u259	Yeah?
s06_e19_c11_u260	Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
s06_e19_c11_u261	Oh-okay, but Pheebs?
s06_e19_c11_u262	Yeah?
s06_e19_c11_u263	I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
s06_e19_c11_u264	Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)
s06_e19_c11_u265	No! You can't do that!
s06_e19_c11_u266	Maybe I should go!
s06_e19_c11_u267	(stopping him) Sit down! We're winning!
s06_e19_c11_u268	Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!
s06_e19_c11_u269	(Chandler stops her) No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!
s06_e19_c11_u270	Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
s06_e19_c11_u271	It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)
s06_e19_c11_u272	Yeah, I'm good.
s06_e19_c11_u273	Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.
s06_e19_c11_u274	Y'know what Phoebe? This isn't really worth the free massage.
s06_e19_c11_u275	That's right Patrick, bye-bye!
s06_e19_c11_u276	(To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!
s06_e19_c11_u277	No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! (She gets up to yell at her friends.') What is the matter with you guys?
s06_e19_c11_u278	Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
s06_e19_c11_u279	I- Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
s06_e19_c11_u280	I'm a little embarrassed. (Chandler shushes him.)
s06_e19_c11_u281	I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!
s06_e19_c11_u282	Then why did she ask us to
s06_e19_c11_u283	I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (He nods) and-and y'know-(Feels Eldad's hair)-Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
s06_e19_c11_u284	Yes, Papaya Extract.
s06_e19_c11_u285	Thank you! (Storms out.)
s06_e19_c12_u286	So uh, have a great time down there.
s06_e19_c12_u287	I will.
s06_e19_c12_u288	Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
s06_e19_c12_u289	Yeah.
s06_e19_c12_u290	It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure.
s06_e19_c12_u291	Oh, don't worry I have plenty of sun block, it's SPF-30.
s06_e19_c12_u292	Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk.
s06_e19_c12_u293	Ross, it's going to be okay. I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
s06_e19_c12_u294	Really?
s06_e19_c12_u295	Yeah! I'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
s06_e19_c12_u296	Okay. Cool.
s06_e19_c12_u297	Oh hey! Here they are!
s06_e19_c12_u298	Call me!
s06_e19_c13_u299	Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
s06_e19_c13_u300	Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
s06_e19_c13_u301	So what was it for anyway?
s06_e19_c13_u302	I wanna say a disease.
s06_e19_c13_u303	(entering) Hey!
s06_e19_c13_u304	Hey!
s06_e19_c13_u305	I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
s06_e19_c13_u306	Huh. All right.
s06_e19_c13_u307	Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
s06_e19_c13_u308	Oh-oh Professor Geller.
s06_e19_c13_u309	Ahh, to be 13 again.
s06_e19_c13_u310	Yeah.
s04_e19_c01_u001	(singing, duh) Morning's here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning's here! The morning's here!
s04_e19_c01_u002	HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
s04_e19_c01_u003	Oh come on! Morning's here! (Starts singing) Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
s04_e19_c01_u004	I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
s04_e19_c01_u005	Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning's here! Morning is here-
s04_e19_c01_u006	Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
s04_e19_c01_u007	Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
s04_e19_c01_u008	Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
s04_e19_c01_u009	Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
s04_e19_c01_u010	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
s04_e19_c01_u011	Okay.
s04_e19_c01_u012	See, this is a great apartment.
s04_e19_c01_u013	Shut up! This place is a hole!
s04_e19_c02_u014	Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
s04_e19_c02_u015	Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around, pretending like he's jamming.)
s04_e19_c02_u016	He does that?!
s04_e19_c02_u017	Uh, I don't know, whatever.
s04_e19_c02_u018	I think it makes you look really dangerous.
s04_e19_c02_u019	Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
s04_e19_c02_u020	I love both of you!
s04_e19_c02_u021	Yeah?
s04_e19_c02_u022	I wish I didn't have to go.
s04_e19_c02_u023	Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
s04_e19_c02_u024	Ohh, Ross, please!
s04_e19_c02_u025	One more day, seriously/
s04_e19_c02_u026	Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
s04_e19_c02_u027	So, then you can stay as long as you want.
s04_e19_c02_u028	I wish I could.
s04_e19_c02_u029	Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on! (She puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)
s04_e19_c02_u030	I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
s04_e19_c02_u031	Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
s04_e19_c02_u032	You didn't!
s04_e19_c02_u033	No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
s04_e19_c03_u034	(entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!
s04_e19_c03_u035	Ho! Ho! Ho!
s04_e19_c03_u036	Excuse me.

s04_e19_c03_u042	Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who's been naughty and who's been nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.) Ohh.
s04_e19_c03_u043	(entering) Hey!
s04_e19_c03_u044	(entering) Hey!
s04_e19_c03_u045	So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?
s04_e19_c03_u046	I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny.
s04_e19_c03_u047	Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
s04_e19_c03_u048	Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I don't belong here."
s04_e19_c03_u049	You have Knicks tickets?
s04_e19_c03_u050	Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
s04_e19_c03_u051	Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats.
s04_e19_c03_u052	Yeah.
s04_e19_c03_u053	(examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
s04_e19_c03_u054	Do you guys want these?
s04_e19_c03_u055	Yeah we do!
s04_e19_c03_u056	Ohh, well you got em.
s04_e19_c03_u057	Just give us our apartment back!
s04_e19_c03_u058	Boy! I didn't see that coming!
s04_e19_c03_u059	Are you serious?
s04_e19_c03_u060	Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
s04_e19_c03_u061	Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
s04_e19_c03_u062	You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
s04_e19_c03_u063	What do you say?
s04_e19_c03_u064	Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
s04_e19_c03_u065	You're bachelor pad?!
s04_e19_c03_u066	Have you even had a girl up here?
s04_e19_c03_u067	No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
s04_e19_c03_u068	Yeah, you do!
s04_e19_c04_u069	Come on!
s04_e19_c04_u070	(ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
s04_e19_c04_u071	Good one.
s04_e19_c04_u072	Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
s04_e19_c04_u073	Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
s04_e19_c04_u074	Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
s04_e19_c04_u075	(entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)
s04_e19_c04_u076	Hey!
s04_e19_c04_u077	Oh my God!
s04_e19_c04_u078	We don't make enough fun of you already?
s04_e19_c04_u079	Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
s04_e19_c04_u080	You do know that Wham broke up?
s04_e19_c04_u081	I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
s04_e19_c04_u082	Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
s04_e19_c04_u083	Where is Emily?
s04_e19_c04_u084	Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
s04_e19_c04_u085	Man, didn't she like just get here?
s04_e19_c04_u086	Yeah!! Yeah!
s04_e19_c04_u087	Easy tiger.
s04_e19_c04_u088	I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
s04_e19_c04_u089	So what are you going to do?
s04_e19_c04_u090	Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
s04_e19_c04_u091	What?
s04_e19_c04_u092	I could ask her to live with me!
s04_e19_c04_u093	Are you serious?
s04_e19_c04_u094	I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
s04_e19_c04_u095	Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
s04_e19_c04_u096	Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
s04_e19_c04_u097	And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.
s04_e19_c04_u098	All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
s04_e19_c04_u099	I don't want to do that.
s04_e19_c04_u100	No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
s04_e19_c04_u101	Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)
s04_e19_c04_u102	Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
s04_e19_c05_u103	That's too hard. Too hard!
s04_e19_c05_u104	(entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
s04_e19_c05_u105	Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
s04_e19_c05_u106	No thank you.
s04_e19_c05_u107	Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
s04_e19_c05_u108	Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
s04_e19_c05_u109	Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
s04_e19_c05_u110	Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
s04_e19_c05_u111	It's the Knicks!
s04_e19_c05_u112	Screw the Knicks!
s04_e19_c05_u113	Whoa!
s04_e19_c05_u114	I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
s04_e19_c05_u115	Huh.
s04_e19_c05_u116	And the Knicks rule all.
s04_e19_c05_u117	Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
s04_e19_c05_u118	Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
s04_e19_c05_u119	No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
s04_e19_c05_u120	All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
s04_e19_c05_u121	Done!
s04_e19_c05_u122	Let me finish.
s04_e19_c05_u123	Oh.
s04_e19_c05_u124	I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
s04_e19_c05_u125	Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
s04_e19_c05_u126	Or you could end up with everything.
s04_e19_c05_u127	Ooh, I like that.
s04_e19_c05_u128	All right, so what do you say?
s04_e19_c05_u129	No!
s04_e19_c05_u130	Oh, just do it!!
s04_e19_c05_u131	Op, op, I'm convinced!
s04_e19_c05_u132	Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
s04_e19_c05_u133	All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
s04_e19_c05_u134	All right!
s04_e19_c05_u135	Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
s04_e19_c05_u136	Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
s04_e19_c05_u137	Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
s04_e19_c05_u138	Okay!
s04_e19_c05_u139	Okay!
s04_e19_c05_u140	This is great!
s04_e19_c05_u141	What's the game?! What's the game?!
s04_e19_c05_u142	Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
s04_e19_c05_u143	They're green?
s04_e19_c05_u144	Good! Good! Five points!
s04_e19_c05_u145	All right, Joey, same question.
s04_e19_c05_u146	Uhh, they're tall.
s04_e19_c05_u147	Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
s04_e19_c05_u148	That's not even a game!
s04_e19_c05_u149	What? Shut up! We're winning!
s04_e19_c05_u150	You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
s04_e19_c05_u151	Fine, let's do it.
s04_e19_c05_u152	Oh, I have cards!
s04_e19_c05_u153	Oh.
s04_e19_c05_u154	Oh, good.

s04_e19_c05_u156	Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
s04_e19_c05_u157	Okay.
s04_e19_c05_u158	Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.
s04_e19_c05_u159	That's a low one!
s04_e19_c05_u160	Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can't.
s04_e19_c05_u161	What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)
s04_e19_c05_u162	Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!
s04_e19_c05_u163	Why are you screaming and hugging?
s04_e19_c05_u164	Because we won our apartment back!
s04_e19_c05_u165	What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
s04_e19_c05_u166	No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
s04_e19_c05_u167	I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.) Ah-ha!
s04_e19_c05_u168	All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.
s04_e19_c05_u169	Okay.
s04_e19_c05_u170	Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!
s04_e19_c05_u171	Uh-huh, not as high as-(picks a card) It worked! King!
s04_e19_c05_u172	Yeah baby!
s04_e19_c05_u173	But, we pick again! We pick again!
s04_e19_c05_u174	Why?!
s04_e19_c05_u175	I don't know!
s04_e19_c05_u176	Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That's courtside baby!
s04_e19_c05_u177	Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
s04_e19_c05_u178	No they didn't!
s04_e19_c06_u179	Hey!
s04_e19_c06_u180	I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
s04_e19_c06_u181	(laughs) Move in with me.
s04_e19_c06_u182	What?!
s04_e19_c06_u183	Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
s04_e19_c06_u184	Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
s04_e19_c06_u185	I know.
s04_e19_c06_u186	My job!
s04_e19_c06_u187	Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
s04_e19_c06_u188	Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
s04_e19_c06_u189	No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
s04_e19_c06_u190	Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future and-and-and we were getting married or something.
s04_e19_c06_u191	What?
s04_e19_c06_u192	Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
s04_e19_c06_u193	No, no, don't. Why don't we?
s04_e19_c06_u194	Why don't we what?
s04_e19_c06_u195	Get married.
s04_e19_c06_u196	You are mad!
s04_e19_c06_u197	No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
s04_e19_c06_u198	We've only known each other for six weeks!
s04_e19_c06_u199	Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
s04_e19_c06_u200	My parents are going to be really mad.
s04_e19_c06_u201	Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
s04_e19_c06_u202	Yes.
s04_e19_c06_u203	Yes!
s04_e19_c06_u204	Yes! We're getting married?!
s04_e19_c06_u205	Oh my God!
s04_e19_c06_u206	Yes!
s04_e19_c06_u207	We're getting married!
s04_e19_c06_u208	Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you marry me?
s04_e19_c06_u209	Yes.
s04_e19_c06_u210	Ohh, it's a bit small.
s04_e19_c06_u211	Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
s04_e19_c06_u212	It was.
s04_e19_c07_u213	Those were like the best seats ever.
s04_e19_c07_u214	Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
s04_e19_c07_u215	Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
s04_e19_c07_u216	Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)
s04_e19_c07_u217	Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!
s04_e19_c07_u218	I KNOW!!!
s04_e19_c07_u219	Open up! Open up! Open up!
s04_e19_c07_u220	We'll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)
s04_e19_c07_u221	What the hell is going on?!
s04_e19_c07_u222	We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)
s04_e19_c07_u223	(opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
s04_e19_c07_u224	We are switching back, right now!
s04_e19_c07_u225	No, we're not! We're not leaving!
s04_e19_c07_u226	Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
s04_e19_c07_u227	I don't know.
s04_e19_c07_u228	What?
s04_e19_c07_u229	I don't want to move again!
s04_e19_c07_u230	I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
s04_e19_c07_u231	All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
s04_e19_c07_u232	Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
s04_e19_c07_u233	Let us keep the apartment and
s04_e19_c07_u234	As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
s04_e19_c07_u235	Totally worth it!
s04_e19_c07_u236	That was one good minute!
s04_e19_c07_u237	Good night.
s04_e19_c07_u238	Good night.
s04_e19_c07_u239	Men are such idiots.
s04_e19_c07_u240	Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
s04_e19_c07_u241	That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
s04_e19_c07_u242	Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
s04_e19_c07_u243	Yeah.
s04_e19_c07_u244	Okay, scarf's done. (It's not really a scarf, it's just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)
s04_e19_c07_u245	Come on! Come on. Come on.
s04_e19_c07_u246	Okay!
s04_e19_c07_u247	Hey!
s04_e19_c07_u248	Hey!
s04_e19_c07_u249	What-what's going on?
s04_e19_c07_u250	Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
s04_e19_c07_u251	Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
s04_e19_c07_u252	What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
s04_e19_c07_u253	Umm, no.
s04_e19_c07_u254	When, when did-how, how did you
s04_e19_c07_u255	We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
s04_e19_c07_u256	I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so
s04_e19_c07_u257	(turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys
s04_e19_c07_u258	Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for Rachel's reaction.) I think it's great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
s04_e19_c07_u259	Oh, well, that's great!
s04_e19_c07_u260	Yeah! Yeah!
s04_e19_c07_u261	(to Ross) I can't believe you're getting married!
s04_e19_c07_u262	Yeah. (They hug again.)
s04_e19_c07_u263	Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at him.)
s04_e19_c08_u264	(singing) Morning's here! The morning's here!
s04_e19_c08_u265	Hey! You're back!
s04_e19_c08_u266	Hey! (Singing) Get into gear!
s04_e19_c08_u267	(singing) Breakfast is near!
s04_e19_c08_u268	I'll see you tomorrow morning!
s04_e19_c08_u269	(happily) Okay!
s08_e22_c01_u001	Hey! What are you guys looking at?
s08_e22_c01_u002	Oh, it's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out.
s08_e22_c01_u003	Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
s08_e22_c01_u004	Uh-huh! I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!
s08_e22_c01_u005	Now I cannot wait to see this.
s08_e22_c01_u006	Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz.
s08_e22_c01_u007	I started that!
s08_e22_c01_u008	I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you're all invited! (They all gasp.)
s08_e22_c01_u009	Are we gonna take a limo?
s08_e22_c01_u010	Sure! Why not?!
s08_e22_c01_u011	Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
s08_e22_c01_u012	Well obviously I won't be able to come, for those of you who haven't checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y'know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you've been during this time. I really couldn't have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
s08_e22_c02_u013	That's right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the couch) Come on people! Please make some room!
s08_e22_c02_u014	Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the green armchair.)
s08_e22_c02_u015	You. Like you haven't done enough.
s08_e22_c02_u016	Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea. (He sits back down.)
s08_e22_c02_u017	God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
s08_e22_c02_u018	Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end
s08_e22_c02_u019	(interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that's a great story. Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
s08_e22_c02_u020	Let's. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)
s08_e22_c03_u021	Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
s08_e22_c03_u022	Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? Cause I'll do it.
s08_e22_c03_u023	What are you doing here so early?
s08_e22_c03_u024	They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y'know what? Screw em! If they don't want me there, I'll just hang out with you guys.
s08_e22_c03_u025	Or you can do volunteer work.
s08_e22_c03_u026	Hello?
s08_e22_c03_u027	Joey! It's Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.
s08_e22_c03_u028	One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
s08_e22_c03_u029	Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
s08_e22_c03_u030	Oh my God. So that's it?! I only get to bring one guest?
s08_e22_c03_u031	Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?
s08_e22_c03_u032	(to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
s08_e22_c03_u033	(overhearing that) What-what about me?
s08_e22_c03_u034	You said you didn't want to go.
s08_e22_c03_u035	I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I'm pregnant you think I'm invisible.
s08_e22_c03_u036	Definitely not invisible.
s08_e22_c03_u037	Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose.
s08_e22_c03_u038	He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class.
s08_e22_c03_u039	Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)
s08_e22_c03_u040	I haven't seen this dress.
s08_e22_c03_u041	Star in a movie.
s08_e22_c03_u042	Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.
s08_e22_c03_u043	Well uh-I think I want to take Chandler.
s08_e22_c03_u044	(still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster) Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)
s08_e22_c03_u045	You really want to take me?
s08_e22_c03_u046	Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
s08_e22_c03_u047	So you're never actually going to pay me back?
s08_e22_c03_u048	Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him? Joey, I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
s08_e22_c03_u049	It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything. Y'know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn't believe in myself.
s08_e22_c03_u050	I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
s08_e22_c03_u051	Thanks. That means a lot to me.
s08_e22_c03_u052	Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
s08_e22_c03_u053	(in a manly voice) I'm gonna go shave. (Gets up.)
s08_e22_c03_u054	(in a manly voice) Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)
s08_e22_c03_u055	Oh, I have to pee. If I don't come out in five minutes it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)
s08_e22_c03_u056	When she comes out, you hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.
s08_e22_c03_u057	She's over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
s08_e22_c03_u058	I don't know. I-I think it's still gonna be a while.
s08_e22_c03_u059	Hmm, care to make it interesting? I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
s08_e22_c03_u060	You're on!
s08_e22_c03_u061	Okay, how much?
s08_e22_c03_u062	One hundred thousand dollars!
s08_e22_c03_u063	How about fifty bucks?
s08_e22_c03_u064	Fine! I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
s08_e22_c03_u065	(calling from the bathroom) All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!
s08_e22_c03_u066	No one's here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!
s08_e22_c04_u067	This is so exciting! It's so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
s08_e22_c04_u068	A little tall.
s08_e22_c04_u069	What?
s08_e22_c04_u070	Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)
s08_e22_c04_u071	It's just so glamorous.
s08_e22_c05_u072	Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you're still pregnant. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y'know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.
s08_e22_c05_u073	Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)
s08_e22_c05_u074	Damnit! Damnit!! Here's your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)
s08_e22_c05_u075	It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
s08_e22_c05_u076	Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
s08_e22_c05_u077	Fine! You're on!
s08_e22_c05_u078	Okay.
s08_e22_c05_u079	Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp (She puts the bill in her bra) right there.
s08_e22_c05_u080	(entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.
s08_e22_c05_u081	She's in the bathroom.
s08_e22_c05_u082	Rach, we gotta go.
s08_e22_c05_u083	In a minute!!!
s08_e22_c05_u084	People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them.
s08_e22_c05_u085	(entering) All right, all right. Let's go!
s08_e22_c05_u086	Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry
s08_e22_c05_u087	No, I'm fine.
s08_e22_c05_u088	Really? You don't think that's a little inappropriate. (She's wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
s08_e22_c05_u089	Good God man don't anger it.
s08_e22_c05_u090	Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
s08_e22_c05_u091	Fine! Fine! Y'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
s08_e22_c05_u092	Oh uh-uh pal! Don't call me mommy! It's bad enough you call your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)
s08_e22_c05_u093	I'm actually with her on this one.
s08_e22_c06_u094	(onscreen) "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
s08_e22_c06_u095	(To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up. (He looks over and Chandler and notices that he's asleep.)
s08_e22_c07_u096	Ross.
s08_e22_c07_u097	Yeah?
s08_e22_c07_u098	Can I ask you something?
s08_e22_c07_u099	Uh-huh.
s08_e22_c07_u100	When Carol was pregnant with Ben
s08_e22_c07_u101	Mmm?
s08_e22_c07_u102	were you this irritating?
s08_e22_c07_u103	Wow!
s08_e22_c07_u104	Excuse me?!
s08_e22_c07_u105	Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
s08_e22_c07_u106	Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
s08_e22_c07_u107	Y'know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then.
s08_e22_c07_u108	(silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!
s08_e22_c07_u109	Y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
s08_e22_c07_u110	Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
s08_e22_c07_u111	(to Rachel) Oh, you're nice to her.
s08_e22_c07_u112	She has the drugs!
s08_e22_c07_u113	We'll do a quick check.
s08_e22_c07_u114	Okay. (Rachel lies back.)
s08_e22_c07_u115	So, eight days late huh?
s08_e22_c07_u116	Yeah.
s08_e22_c07_u117	You must be a little uncomfortable.
s08_e22_c07_u118	Eh, just a tad.
s08_e22_c07_u119	You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
s08_e22_c07_u120	Do them!!
s08_e22_c07_u121	Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.
s08_e22_c07_u122	Well, we are ready to try anything.
s08_e22_c07_u123	Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.
s08_e22_c07_u124	Okay.
s08_e22_c07_u125	You can take some caster oil, there's eating spicy foods
s08_e22_c07_u126	Great! We will do all of those.
s08_e22_c07_u127	taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective: sex.
s08_e22_c07_u128	You've got to be kidding me!
s08_e22_c08_u129	Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
s08_e22_c08_u130	You liked it? You really liked it?
s08_e22_c08_u131	Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
s08_e22_c08_u132	Which part exactly?
s08_e22_c08_u133	The whole thing! Can we go?
s08_e22_c08_u134	Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
s08_e22_c08_u135	I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
s08_e22_c08_u136	Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
s08_e22_c08_u137	I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
s08_e22_c08_u138	You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! That's for coming buddy. I'll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)
s08_e22_c08_u139	Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! (Sees another guy who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! (Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.
s08_e22_c09_u140	Hey!
s08_e22_c09_u141	Hey.
s08_e22_c09_u142	Hi!
s08_e22_c09_u143	What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
s08_e22_c09_u144	No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
s08_e22_c09_u145	Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
s08_e22_c09_u146	Well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that, (mimicking Ross) "That will open up a can of worms."
s08_e22_c09_u147	Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.
s08_e22_c09_u148	It's sex.
s08_e22_c09_u149	Do it!
s08_e22_c09_u150	Monica!
s08_e22_c09_u151	I'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!
s08_e22_c09_u152	Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
s08_e22_c09_u153	All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!
s08_e22_c09_u154	Monica, what is the matter with you?
s08_e22_c09_u155	Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
s08_e22_c09_u156	Why? Why today?
s08_e22_c09_u157	Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
s08_e22_c09_u158	What?! While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers her head and shakes it yes.)
s08_e22_c09_u159	I'll take that bet.
s08_e22_c09_u160	What?!
s08_e22_c09_u161	Well, I'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
s08_e22_c09_u162	Can I get some of that action?
s08_e22_c09_u163	Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
s08_e22_c09_u164	Oh honey, don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow's the day.
s08_e22_c09_u165	Oh, okay!
s08_e22_c10_u166	Hey! Sleeping beauty!
s08_e22_c10_u167	Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
s08_e22_c10_u168	(in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
s08_e22_c10_u169	I'm so sorry.
s08_e22_c10_u170	Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?
s08_e22_c10_u171	What?!
s08_e22_c10_u172	Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!
s08_e22_c10_u173	You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money
s08_e22_c10_u174	Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
s08_e22_c10_u175	I don't know, five hundred dollars?
s08_e22_c10_u176	Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
s08_e22_c10_u177	Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
s08_e22_c10_u178	Okay, so that's another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that's- (Pauses to figure it out.)
s08_e22_c10_u179	Do you want a calculator?
s08_e22_c10_u180	Please!
s08_e22_c10_u181	Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
s08_e22_c10_u182	All right, what else?
s08_e22_c10_u183	Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes
s08_e22_c10_u184	Which we're still keeping under our hats!
s08_e22_c10_u185	Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
s08_e22_c10_u186	What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) "The south will rise again man."
s08_e22_c10_u187	Yes, money well spent!
s08_e22_c10_u188	Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
s08_e22_c10_u189	Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food
s08_e22_c10_u190	Okay. Okay, so I'm writing you a check for-So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
s08_e22_c11_u191	Come on, finish your enchilada.
s08_e22_c11_u192	Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
s08_e22_c11_u193	Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha- Oh God! So-so hot! (Rubs his eyes.) Oh my-(Laughs.) By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
s08_e22_c11_u194	I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
s08_e22_c11_u195	Stop it.
s08_e22_c11_u196	Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what's gonna work! It's doctor recommended!
s08_e22_c11_u197	I'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying.
s08_e22_c11_u198	Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
s08_e22_c11_u199	This is insane, I'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor.
s08_e22_c11_u200	Make love? What are you a girl?
s08_e22_c11_u201	Always a great way to get in a man's pants.
s08_e22_c11_u202	But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
s08_e22_c11_u203	I love when you talk dirty to me.
s08_e22_c11_u204	Oh, I know it. You're right. That's not sexy. Oh-Oh! (Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. (Tries too, but can't quite seem to make it.) Oh God!
s08_e22_c11_u205	Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
s08_e22_c11_u206	Come on Ross! I'm miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
s08_e22_c11_u207	Y'know what?
s08_e22_c11_u208	What?!
s08_e22_c11_u209	Forget it.
s08_e22_c11_u210	Oh wow! What now Ross you're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough- (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!
s08_e22_c11_u211	I'm getting that baby out of you!
s08_e22_c11_u212	(breaking the kiss) Oh God!
s08_e22_c11_u213	Oh, I know.
s08_e22_c11_u214	Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
s08_e22_c11_u215	I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
s08_e22_c11_u216	Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
s08_e22_c11_u217	Hey!
s08_e22_c11_u218	Yeah.
s08_e22_c11_u219	We're having a baby.
s08_e22_c11_u220	I didn't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to
s08_e22_c11_u221	Not so much.
s08_e22_c11_u222	Okay.
s08_e22_c12_u223	Two hundred.
s08_e22_c12_u224	Thank you!
s08_e22_c12_u225	That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting.
s08_e22_c12_u226	Okay.
s08_e22_c12_u227	Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I guess we can bet one more time.
s08_e22_c12_u228	Is Rachel having the baby?
s08_e22_c12_u229	How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey's apartment.) Joey! Chandler!! It's time!
s08_e22_c12_u230	They're at the coffeehouse.
s08_e22_c12_u231	You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. (Phoebe isn't interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She's still not interested.) I bet you it's a girl.
s08_e22_c12_u232	We know it's a girl! (Exits.)
s08_e22_c12_u233	(following her) I'll give you really good odds.
s08_e11_c01_u001	Phoebe?
s08_e11_c01_u002	Yeah?
s08_e11_c01_u003	Look at that guy by the window, wow!
s08_e11_c01_u004	He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
s08_e11_c01_u005	Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
s08_e11_c01_u006	Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
s08_e11_c01_u007	Yeah.
s08_e11_c01_u008	This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
s08_e11_c01_u009	Really?! So this has happened to you?
s08_e11_c01_u010	Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
s08_e11_c01_u011	Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.
s08_e11_c01_u012	Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
s08_e11_c01_u013	Ah.
s08_e11_c01_u014	Yeah.
s08_e11_c01_u015	Well, y'know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
s08_e11_c01_u016	Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good-pill.
s08_e11_c02_u017	Hey! (To Joey) Hey!
s08_e11_c02_u018	Hi!
s08_e11_c02_u019	Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
s08_e11_c02_u020	Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
s08_e11_c02_u021	Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. (Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn't move from his chair.)
s08_e11_c02_u022	Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
s08_e11_c02_u023	Oh yeah, probably at the end. (Flips to the end.) Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
s08_e11_c02_u024	I'm missin' picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at him and he retreats.)
s08_e11_c02_u025	(sitting down next to Ross) Y'know she has a face Ross!
s08_e11_c02_u026	Okay. Okay, here's a good one of us.
s08_e11_c02_u027	Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
s08_e11_c02_u028	Y'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
s08_e11_c02_u029	(pause) Together? Like-like to people?
s08_e11_c02_u030	Yeah, y'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?
s08_e11_c02_u031	Okay. (Not happy about it.)
s08_e11_c02_u032	Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
s08_e11_c02_u033	Uh sure, sure.
s08_e11_c02_u034	Bye guys.
s08_e11_c02_u035	Bye.
s08_e11_c02_u036	(To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!
s08_e11_c02_u037	I know. Can you believe that?
s08_e11_c02_u038	Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
s08_e11_c02_u039	Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
s08_e11_c02_u040	Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!
s08_e11_c03_u041	Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
s08_e11_c03_u042	Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
s08_e11_c03_u043	Yes, hi.
s08_e11_c03_u044	Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
s08_e11_c03_u045	I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.
s08_e11_c03_u046	Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
s08_e11_c03_u047	No leg-chewing for us sir.
s08_e11_c03_u048	Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we've got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
s08_e11_c03_u049	I can't think of anything we're doing. (Quietly) Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
s08_e11_c03_u050	Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
s08_e11_c03_u051	Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
s08_e11_c03_u052	No.
s08_e11_c03_u053	That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
s08_e11_c03_u054	Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?
s08_e11_c04_u055	Hi!
s08_e11_c04_u056	Hey!
s08_e11_c04_u057	Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
s08_e11_c04_u058	Huh. Wow, this is great.
s08_e11_c04_u059	Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
s08_e11_c04_u060	Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
s08_e11_c04_u061	How many did you want? I'm getting a hundred.
s08_e11_c04_u062	A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I'll take a-Mona, uh-I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
s08_e11_c04_u063	Really? Why not?
s08_e11_c04_u064	Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.
s08_e11_c04_u065	Oh y'know, I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right. So, can I ask you a question?
s08_e11_c04_u066	Yeah.
s08_e11_c04_u067	Where are we?
s08_e11_c04_u068	Huh.
s08_e11_c04_u069	Y'know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?
s08_e11_c04_u070	Hmm
s08_e11_c04_u071	I mean I love spending time with you, y'know I just-I hope we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you think?
s08_e11_c04_u072	Let's do the card!
s08_e11_c04_u073	What?
s08_e11_c04_u074	The card! I think we're there!
s08_e11_c04_u075	Okay. I-But I think we should still have this conversation.
s08_e11_c04_u076	Really?! I mean, even with the card?
s08_e11_c05_u077	Hi!
s08_e11_c05_u078	Hi!
s08_e11_c05_u079	Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today, she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
s08_e11_c05_u080	Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y'know who I'm talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers- (Stops when she realizes it was her.)
s08_e11_c05_u081	(entering) Hi Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff. (By the way, he's an attractive man.)
s08_e11_c05_u082	Yes, you are.
s08_e11_c05_u083	So, how's it going?
s08_e11_c05_u084	Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
s08_e11_c05_u085	I'm a doctor.
s08_e11_c05_u086	Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
s08_e11_c05_u087	Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
s08_e11_c05_u088	Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
s08_e11_c05_u089	So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
s08_e11_c05_u090	No. I'm very comfortable.
s08_e11_c05_u091	Any painful gas?
s08_e11_c05_u092	No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
s08_e11_c05_u093	Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?
s08_e11_c05_u094	Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
s08_e11_c05_u095	I'm sorry, is there something going on here?
s08_e11_c05_u096	Do you feel it too?
s08_e11_c06_u097	Hi.
s08_e11_c06_u098	Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
s08_e11_c06_u099	Well, let's see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
s08_e11_c06_u100	Oh my God.
s08_e11_c06_u101	Why did you do that?
s08_e11_c06_u102	Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
s08_e11_c06_u103	Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
s08_e11_c06_u104	You wish.
s08_e11_c06_u105	Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
s08_e11_c06_u106	Oh yeah? Come and get it.
s08_e11_c06_u107	Okay, even this is turning me on!
s08_e11_c06_u108	(entering) Hey!
s08_e11_c06_u109	Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
s08_e11_c06_u110	Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!
s08_e11_c06_u111	You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
s08_e11_c06_u112	Yeah, we're not just doing a card! Y'know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
s08_e11_c06_u113	Ugh! Women!
s08_e11_c06_u114	I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
s08_e11_c06_u115	Uh Ross? You asked me that.
s08_e11_c06_u116	Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.
s08_e11_c06_u117	Like asking her to move in with you?
s08_e11_c06_u118	Smaller than that.
s08_e11_c06_u119	Making her a mixed tape?
s08_e11_c06_u120	Uh, bigger than that.
s08_e11_c06_u121	Give her a key to your apartment.
s08_e11_c06_u122	Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
s08_e11_c06_u123	All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
s08_e11_c06_u124	Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
s08_e11_c06_u125	No, we hate that.
s08_e11_c06_u126	That is a slap in the face.
s08_e11_c06_u127	Forget it. I-I-Y'know what? I'll just have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
s08_e11_c06_u128	I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
s08_e11_c07_u129	Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.
s08_e11_c07_u130	Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
s08_e11_c07_u131	Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
s08_e11_c07_u132	Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
s08_e11_c07_u133	Oh? Why not?
s08_e11_c07_u134	It's the semi-finals-of her-botchy ball tournament.
s08_e11_c07_u135	What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
s08_e11_c07_u136	Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
s08_e11_c07_u137	So why can't the three of us go out together?
s08_e11_c07_u138	Because uh-we-we-we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
s08_e11_c07_u139	Good God Bing I-well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
s08_e11_c07_u140	Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
s08_e11_c07_u141	Bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this. Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.
s08_e11_c07_u142	Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with that bitch.
s08_e11_c08_u143	Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
s08_e11_c08_u144	Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
s08_e11_c08_u145	Aw, we-we are so-(Motions that they're connected.) So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there isn't.)
s08_e11_c08_u146	Okay.
s08_e11_c08_u147	I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is-is it's going somewhere-fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean-you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?
s08_e11_c08_u148	I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?
s08_e11_c08_u149	Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young.
s08_e11_c08_u150	Okay
s08_e11_c08_u151	But that's not enough. So- So-here's a key to my apartment. (Hands her his key.)
s08_e11_c08_u152	Really?!
s08_e11_c08_u153	Really.
s08_e11_c08_u154	You don't think this is too fast.
s08_e11_c09_u155	You gave her a key to your apartment?!
s08_e11_c09_u156	Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
s08_e11_c09_u157	(entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?
s08_e11_c09_u158	Oh great, I live on the street.
s08_e11_c09_u159	Where?! (Ross exits.)
s08_e11_c09_u160	Hey!
s08_e11_c09_u161	Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
s08_e11_c09_u162	Hi Roger.
s08_e11_c09_u163	So umm, I'm gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me out?
s08_e11_c09_u164	Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)
s08_e11_c09_u165	Umm, he's here to have sex with you.
s08_e11_c09_u166	What?
s08_e11_c09_u167	You're welcome.
s08_e11_c09_u168	Phoebe no!
s08_e11_c09_u169	It's okay, he's a virgin.
s08_e11_c09_u170	Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.
s08_e11_c09_u171	Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.
s08_e11_c09_u172	No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
s08_e11_c09_u173	Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! (Phoebe exits.)
s08_e11_c10_u174	Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?
s08_e11_c10_u175	Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl.
s08_e11_c10_u176	Bing-What's this?! (Grabs his hand.)
s08_e11_c10_u177	It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
s08_e11_c10_u178	No, it's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
s08_e11_c10_u179	Oh no-no-no!
s08_e11_c10_u180	Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y'know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
s08_e11_c11_u181	Okay, and oh I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
s08_e11_c11_u182	(entering) Hey Ross, what's going on? You changing the lock?
s08_e11_c11_u183	No. That guy is.
s08_e11_c11_u184	I don't understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
s08_e11_c11_u185	Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you're-you're sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
s08_e11_c11_u186	I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
s08_e11_c11_u187	What?
s08_e11_c11_u188	I love you!
s08_e11_c11_u189	Ohh! (Hugs him.) And I love spending time with you. (Ross isn't happy.)
s08_e11_c12_u190	Hi honey I'm home.
s08_e11_c12_u191	From the tequila factory?
s08_e11_c12_u192	It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
s08_e11_c12_u193	Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
s08_e11_c12_u194	Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
s08_e11_c12_u195	I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
s08_e11_c12_u196	Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
s08_e11_c13_u197	Yes. Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey enters.) I'll call you back.
s08_e11_c13_u198	Who was that?
s08_e11_c13_u199	It's just the pizza place.
s08_e11_c13_u200	You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
s08_e11_c13_u201	I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.
s08_e11_c13_u202	Oh, what's wrong?
s08_e11_c13_u203	Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.
s08_e11_c13_u204	Then why did I ask?
s08_e11_c13_u205	Okay, it's just-and this is really embarrassing-but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself-how do I put this umm, erotically charged.
s08_e11_c13_u206	Is that college talk for horny?
s08_e11_c13_u207	Yeah. So y'know, I have all of these feelings and I don't know what to do about them, because I can't date like a normal person, which is fine because I don't need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y'know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he's doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so-hard-to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?
s08_e11_c13_u208	Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
s08_e11_c13_u209	Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.
s08_e11_c13_u210	Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
s08_e11_c13_u211	Okay, good night!
s08_e11_c13_u212	Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)
s08_e11_c13_u213	(entering) I can't do it!
s08_e11_c13_u214	(entering) I didn't ask you to do it!
s08_e11_c13_u215	You're Rachel!
s08_e11_c13_u216	You're Joey!
s08_e11_c13_u217	You're my friend!
s08_e11_c13_u218	Right back at ya!
s08_e11_c13_u219	But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
s08_e11_c13_u220	And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!
s08_e11_c13_u221	I know!
s08_e11_c13_u222	Do you wanna do it?
s08_e11_c13_u223	No!
s08_e11_c13_u224	All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
s08_e11_c13_u225	That's the end of this conversation!
s08_e11_c13_u226	This conversation never happened!
s08_e11_c13_u227	Never happened! Good night!
s08_e11_c13_u228	Good night!
s08_e11_c13_u229	Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)
s08_e11_c14_u230	Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I'm gonna, I'm gonna want him back. So- (Looks at him longingly) I'm gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause) (Entering) I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't! (She grabs the cutout and exits for good.)
s03_e05_c01_u001	(entering) Hey!
s03_e05_c01_u002	Hey!
s03_e05_c01_u003	Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
s03_e05_c01_u004	No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
s03_e05_c01_u005	Yeah!
s03_e05_c01_u006	Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
s03_e05_c01_u007	You're building a post office?
s03_e05_c01_u008	No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max.
s03_e05_c01_u009	Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word! Those are snug.
s03_e05_c01_u010	Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's.
s03_e05_c01_u011	Power saw kinda got away from me there.
s03_e05_c02_u012	(joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs.
s03_e05_c02_u013	Hey!
s03_e05_c02_u014	Any sign of your brother?
s03_e05_c02_u015	No, but he's always late.
s03_e05_c02_u016	I thought you only met him once?
s03_e05_c02_u017	Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, Frank's always late.'
s03_e05_c02_u018	Well relax, he'll be here.
s03_e05_c02_u019	No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
s03_e05_c02_u020	Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)
s03_e05_c03_u021	Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
s03_e05_c03_u022	No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
s03_e05_c03_u023	All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
s03_e05_c03_u024	Her what?
s03_e05_c03_u025	Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad.
s03_e05_c03_u026	Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
s03_e05_c03_u027	So, Chandler, who's on your list?
s03_e05_c03_u028	Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
s03_e05_c03_u029	Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
s03_e05_c03_u030	I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
s03_e05_c03_u031	Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
s03_e05_c03_u032	First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
s03_e05_c03_u033	It's just a game Mon. (makes a Can-you-believe-her' face to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?
s03_e05_c03_u034	Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.
s03_e05_c03_u035	Spiderman?
s03_e05_c03_u036	Hardy Boy.
s03_e05_c03_u037	Peter Parker.
s03_e05_c03_u038	Thank you.
s03_e05_c03_u039	What about you honey, who would be on your list?
s03_e05_c03_u040	Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I'll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
s03_e05_c03_u041	(coughing) What a geek!
s03_e05_c03_u042	(entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
s03_e05_c03_u043	Oh, hi.
s03_e05_c03_u044	This is everybody. This is Ross.
s03_e05_c03_u045	How are you?
s03_e05_c03_u046	Hey.
s03_e05_c03_u047	Chandler.
s03_e05_c03_u048	Hi.
s03_e05_c03_u049	Hi.
s03_e05_c03_u050	Joey.
s03_e05_c03_u051	Hey-hey!
s03_e05_c03_u052	Hey.
s03_e05_c03_u053	This is Monica.
s03_e05_c03_u054	Whoa!
s03_e05_c03_u055	And this is Rachel.
s03_e05_c03_u056	Hi!
s03_e05_c03_u057	Whoa!!
s03_e05_c03_u058	I'm gonna get coffee.
s03_e05_c03_u059	Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
s03_e05_c03_u060	We don't, really.
s03_e05_c03_u061	Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
s03_e05_c03_u062	Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.
s03_e05_c03_u063	Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
s03_e05_c03_u064	You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
s03_e05_c03_u065	I know.
s03_e05_c04_u066	Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get ya?
s03_e05_c04_u067	No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
s03_e05_c04_u068	Calm down, do you want this unit or not?
s03_e05_c04_u069	I do NOT want this unit!!
s03_e05_c04_u070	Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's.
s03_e05_c04_u071	Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom half of the door.)
s03_e05_c05_u072	Hey! Where ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
s03_e05_c05_u073	Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
s03_e05_c05_u074	Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?
s03_e05_c05_u075	Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all.
s03_e05_c05_u076	I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)
s03_e05_c05_u077	Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.
s03_e05_c05_u078	I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
s03_e05_c05_u079	Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)
s03_e05_c05_u080	That's a little more than I wanted to see.
s03_e05_c05_u081	(manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)
s03_e05_c05_u082	I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
s03_e05_c05_u083	Eh! There you go.
s03_e05_c05_u084	You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
s03_e05_c06_u085	(sits up) Oh, ew!
s03_e05_c06_u086	What?
s03_e05_c06_u087	Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
s03_e05_c06_u088	What, wait, you mean like this? (does it)
s03_e05_c06_u089	Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can't)
s03_e05_c06_u090	Your not doing it.
s03_e05_c06_u091	Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....
s03_e05_c06_u092	When's your birthday?
s03_e05_c06_u093	Feburary 16th.
s03_e05_c06_u094	I know a guy who's the 18th.
s03_e05_c06_u095	Wow, that's close. When's yours?
s03_e05_c06_u096	October 25th.
s03_e05_c06_u097	Melt stuff.
s03_e05_c07_u098	Okay, I've got three of my five.
s03_e05_c07_u099	Three of your five, what?
s03_e05_c07_u100	Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
s03_e05_c07_u101	Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
s03_e05_c07_u102	Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left.
s03_e05_c07_u103	All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
s03_e05_c07_u104	Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
s03_e05_c07_u105	Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
s03_e05_c07_u106	Susan Sarandon.
s03_e05_c07_u107	Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
s03_e05_c07_u108	And!! Isabella Rosselini.
s03_e05_c07_u109	Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
s03_e05_c07_u110	So?
s03_e05_c07_u111	So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
s03_e05_c07_u112	Yeah, cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
s03_e05_c08_u113	Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
s03_e05_c08_u114	Yeah.
s03_e05_c08_u115	So is it like art?
s03_e05_c08_u116	Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
s03_e05_c08_u117	Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
s03_e05_c08_u118	No, I wanna melt it.
s03_e05_c08_u119	Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
s03_e05_c08_u120	(starts laughing) Yeah!
s03_e05_c08_u121	G'night, bro.
s03_e05_c08_u122	G'night.
s03_e05_c08_u123	Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case.
s03_e05_c08_u124	Oh, excellent. (starts to melt the fire extinguisher's hose.)
s03_e05_c09_u125	What kind of karate is that?
s03_e05_c09_u126	No kind. He just makes it up.
s03_e05_c09_u127	So how's it going with you guys?
s03_e05_c09_u128	So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
s03_e05_c09_u129	Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe shakes her head like she doesn't understand) That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
s03_e05_c09_u130	Ah!!
s03_e05_c09_u131	Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
s03_e05_c09_u132	Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
s03_e05_c09_u133	Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
s03_e05_c09_u134	I just asked you.
s03_e05_c09_u135	I just asked you.
s03_e05_c09_u136	I don't have time for this.
s03_e05_c09_u137	No, that is what the game is.
s03_e05_c09_u138	Which you just gave up really quickly.
s03_e05_c09_u139	(entering) Have you seen Joey?
s03_e05_c09_u140	What's the matter?
s03_e05_c09_u141	Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
s03_e05_c09_u142	(yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
s03_e05_c09_u143	What's going on?
s03_e05_c09_u144	He's retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)
s03_e05_c09_u145	Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
s03_e05_c09_u146	Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
s03_e05_c09_u147	He started mine first!
s03_e05_c09_u148	Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.
s03_e05_c10_u149	Whoa! Big octopus.
s03_e05_c10_u150	Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) Hello. (listens) Oh my God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well can't someone else do it. (listens) But, I have company. (listens) Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' (hangs up phone) Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do um.
s03_e05_c10_u151	Hey, what kind of work do you do?
s03_e05_c10_u152	Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
s03_e05_c10_u153	You-you work at one of those massage parlors?
s03_e05_c10_u154	Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!
s03_e05_c10_u155	(starts laughing) Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea.
s03_e05_c10_u156	All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
s03_e05_c10_u157	You mean like watch?
s03_e05_c10_u158	No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
s03_e05_c10_u159	Well, I don't think this, y'know.
s03_e05_c10_u160	No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
s03_e05_c10_u161	Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
s03_e05_c11_u162	It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?
s03_e05_c11_u163	What, like a number?
s03_e05_c11_u164	(entering) Hey!
s03_e05_c11_u165	Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)
s03_e05_c11_u166	Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little card)
s03_e05_c11_u167	Well, it's about time.
s03_e05_c11_u168	Ooh, very official.
s03_e05_c11_u169	Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
s03_e05_c11_u170	And who laminated it?
s03_e05_c11_u171	That would be me.
s03_e05_c11_u172	All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?
s03_e05_c11_u173	Hey, it's my list.
s03_e05_c11_u174	Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
s03_e05_c12_u175	Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!
s03_e05_c12_u176	Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
s03_e05_c12_u177	She broke my arm.
s03_e05_c12_u178	He touched my fanny.
s03_e05_c12_u179	No, she touched mine first!
s03_e05_c12_u180	That's my job!
s03_e05_c12_u181	So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?
s03_e05_c12_u182	Ewww!!!
s03_e05_c12_u183	You can't have sex with her!
s03_e05_c12_u184	What'd you think I was, a hooker?
s03_e05_c12_u185	No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop.
s03_e05_c12_u186	Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
s03_e05_c12_u187	Fine. (starts to leave, and points at Frank) I don't like you!! (leaves)
s03_e05_c12_u188	(turns around and hits Frank) So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
s03_e05_c12_u189	Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?
s03_e05_c12_u190	Nooo! Why would you think that?
s03_e05_c12_u191	I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know.
s03_e05_c12_u192	Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
s03_e05_c12_u193	Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.
s03_e05_c12_u194	You really thought it was perfect?
s03_e05_c12_u195	Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, cause we had all those great talks y'know.
s03_e05_c12_u196	Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
s03_e05_c12_u197	Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...
s03_e05_c12_u198	I don't....
s03_e05_c12_u199	How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
s03_e05_c12_u200	Right, okay, um-mm.
s03_e05_c12_u201	Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you cause y'know you're my sister, y'know.
s03_e05_c12_u202	Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
s03_e05_c12_u203	Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
s03_e05_c12_u204	Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know.
s03_e05_c12_u205	You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.
s03_e05_c12_u206	Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
s03_e05_c12_u207	This?
s03_e05_c12_u208	Uh-huh.
s03_e05_c12_u209	Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...
s03_e05_c12_u210	She wasn't a hooker.
s03_e05_c12_u211	Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.
s03_e05_c13_u212	Okay, on three. One....Two....
s03_e05_c13_u213	Why don't we just go on two.
s03_e05_c13_u214	Why two?
s03_e05_c13_u215	Because it's faster.
s03_e05_c13_u216	Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this two' talk.
s03_e05_c13_u217	Oh!
s03_e05_c13_u218	All right, but in the future...
s03_e05_c13_u219	Okay!! Okay!!
s03_e05_c13_u220	Come on!
s03_e05_c13_u221	Heavy thing, not getting lighter!
s03_e05_c13_u222	Okay, one...two...
s03_e05_c13_u223	So we are going on two?
s03_e05_c13_u224	All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem, the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)
s03_e05_c13_u225	Oh, good job Joe.
s03_e05_c13_u226	Wow, it's big!
s03_e05_c13_u227	Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
s03_e05_c13_u228	Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
s03_e05_c13_u229	Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
s03_e05_c13_u230	Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
s03_e05_c13_u231	Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesn't move.)
s03_e05_c13_u232	Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
s03_e05_c14_u233	Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.
s03_e05_c14_u234	(to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please.
s03_e05_c14_u235	Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)
s03_e05_c14_u236	Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.
s03_e05_c14_u237	Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
s03_e05_c14_u238	Why? Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
s03_e05_c14_u239	Yeah, maybe.
s03_e05_c14_u240	Oh-oh, you lie.
s03_e05_c14_u241	What you don't think I'd go up to her?
s03_e05_c14_u242	Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
s03_e05_c14_u243	Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
s03_e05_c14_u244	You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
s03_e05_c14_u245	Okay, hold my crawler.
s03_e05_c14_u246	Okay.
s03_e05_c14_u247	Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
s03_e05_c14_u248	Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
s03_e05_c14_u249	(to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
s03_e05_c14_u250	Aren't you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, who waves back)
s03_e05_c14_u251	Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
s03_e05_c14_u252	I'm sorry. (starts to leave)
s03_e05_c14_u253	Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
s03_e05_c14_u254	Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
s03_e05_c14_u255	Um, yeah.
s03_e05_c14_u256	May I see it?
s03_e05_c14_u257	Um, no.
s03_e05_c14_u258	Come on! (grabs the list)
s03_e05_c14_u259	But, okay.
s03_e05_c14_u260	(reading it) I'm not on the list!
s03_e05_c14_u261	Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
s03_e05_c14_u262	It's laminated!
s03_e05_c14_u263	Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
s03_e05_c14_u264	Y'know it's ironic...
s03_e05_c14_u265	What?
s03_e05_c14_u266	...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)
s03_e05_c14_u267	(to the rest of the gang) We're just gonna be friends.
s03_e05_c15_u268	Y'know what?
s03_e05_c15_u269	Umm?
s03_e05_c15_u270	I bet ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)
s03_e05_c15_u271	I've got five bucks says you can't.
s03_e05_c15_u272	Get out your checkbook, mister.
s03_e05_c15_u273	Oh, I think I have the cash.
s03_e05_c15_u274	You are dogged man! I totally fit!
s03_e05_c15_u275	Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won't open) I'm out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.
s03_e05_c15_u276	Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks are on me!
s03_e20_c01_u001	Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
s03_e20_c01_u002	Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it's like to be you?
s03_e20_c01_u003	Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
s03_e20_c01_u004	Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
s03_e20_c01_u005	Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
s03_e20_c01_u006	(entering) Hey!
s03_e20_c01_u007	Hey!
s03_e20_c01_u008	Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
s03_e20_c01_u009	Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
s03_e20_c01_u010	We were all pretty shaken up about it.
s03_e20_c01_u011	Wait, am I missing something though? Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
s03_e20_c01_u012	Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
s03_e20_c01_u013	Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
s03_e20_c01_u014	You get the dollhouse.
s03_e20_c01_u015	I get the dollhouse!
s03_e20_c01_u016	Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
s03_e20_c01_u017	Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
s03_e20_c01_u018	No, just a barrel.
s03_e20_c01_u019	Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
s03_e20_c01_u020	Really?! Really?!
s03_e20_c01_u021	Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
s03_e20_c01_u022	My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
s03_e20_c02_u023	Hey, Sophie!
s03_e20_c02_u024	Hey, Rach!
s03_e20_c02_u025	Hey.
s03_e20_c02_u026	Hey.
s03_e20_c02_u027	Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
s03_e20_c02_u028	Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)
s03_e20_c02_u029	Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
s03_e20_c02_u030	Yes, I realise that.
s03_e20_c02_u031	Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
s03_e20_c02_u032	That's the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
s03_e20_c02_u033	Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. (to Chandler) Hello! You don't work for me.
s03_e20_c02_u034	(introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler) Joanna.
s03_e20_c02_u035	Bing! That's a great name.
s03_e20_c02_u036	Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
s03_e20_c02_u037	Me too.
s03_e20_c02_u038	Bye, Chandler.
s03_e20_c02_u039	(to Rachel) So ah, what's wrong with him?
s03_e20_c02_u040	Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
s03_e20_c02_u041	Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
s03_e20_c02_u042	No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
s03_e20_c02_u043	Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it.
s03_e20_c02_u044	Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
s03_e20_c02_u045	Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
s03_e20_c02_u046	Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
s03_e20_c02_u047	I know that.
s03_e20_c03_u048	Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
s03_e20_c03_u049	(entering) Hey!
s03_e20_c03_u050	Hello.
s03_e20_c03_u051	Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
s03_e20_c03_u052	I know!!!
s03_e20_c03_u053	So, I'm here, ready to play.
s03_e20_c03_u054	Okay.
s03_e20_c03_u055	I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)
s03_e20_c03_u056	What's this?
s03_e20_c03_u057	That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
s03_e20_c03_u058	Not one that can pee on the roof.
s03_e20_c03_u059	Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
s03_e20_c03_u060	(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
s03_e20_c03_u061	No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
s03_e20_c03_u062	I don't want a ghost.
s03_e20_c03_u063	Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
s03_e20_c03_u064	Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
s03_e20_c03_u065	Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
s03_e20_c03_u066	(entering) Hey!
s03_e20_c03_u067	Hello.
s03_e20_c03_u068	I need to talk to you!
s03_e20_c03_u069	Sure, what's up?
s03_e20_c03_u070	Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
s03_e20_c03_u071	I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)
s03_e20_c03_u072	Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
s03_e20_c03_u073	Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
s03_e20_c03_u074	Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
s03_e20_c03_u075	(looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
s03_e20_c03_u076	Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
s03_e20_c03_u077	Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
s03_e20_c03_u078	(holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
s03_e20_c03_u079	Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
s03_e20_c03_u080	Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
s03_e20_c03_u081	Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
s03_e20_c03_u082	The little ones do.
s03_e20_c04_u083	Hey, Kate!
s03_e20_c04_u084	Morning.
s03_e20_c04_u085	Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
s03_e20_c04_u086	Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! (she goes over to him)
s03_e20_c04_u087	(to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
s03_e20_c04_u088	Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
s03_e20_c04_u089	Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
s03_e20_c04_u090	I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
s03_e20_c04_u091	(looks at her, shocked) What?!
s03_e20_c04_u092	I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
s03_e20_c04_u093	Get out of here, really?!
s03_e20_c04_u094	Absolutely!
s03_e20_c04_u095	Yeah?
s03_e20_c04_u096	Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
s03_e20_c04_u097	They gave me the shaft all right.
s03_e20_c04_u098	(laughing) Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
s03_e20_c04_u099	Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
s03_e20_c04_u100	Cool! I-I'll see you then.
s03_e20_c04_u101	All right.
s03_e20_c04_u102	All right, it's time to act, my talking props. (Both Joey and Kate just look at each other.)
s03_e20_c05_u103	Hey!
s03_e20_c05_u104	Hey!
s03_e20_c05_u105	Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
s03_e20_c05_u106	Wow!!
s03_e20_c05_u107	Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)
s03_e20_c05_u108	Hey, what's this?!
s03_e20_c05_u109	Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)
s03_e20_c05_u110	It's very interesting, Phoebe.
s03_e20_c05_u111	What's this?
s03_e20_c05_u112	The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
s03_e20_c05_u113	This is the coolest house ever!!
s03_e20_c05_u114	Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)
s03_e20_c05_u115	All right!
s03_e20_c05_u116	I would!
s03_e20_c05_u117	Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
s03_e20_c05_u118	Uh-huh.
s03_e20_c05_u119	Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the house.)
s03_e20_c05_u120	Ooohhhh!!
s03_e20_c05_u121	And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)
s03_e20_c05_u122	Ahhhh!!
s03_e20_c05_u123	(entering) Hey, my Father's house does that!
s03_e20_c05_u124	(to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
s03_e20_c05_u125	Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
s03_e20_c05_u126	Hmm.
s03_e20_c05_u127	Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
s03_e20_c06_u128	Chandler is fantastic!!
s03_e20_c06_u129	What?!
s03_e20_c06_u130	Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
s03_e20_c06_u131	Oh, I....
s03_e20_c06_u132	Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
s03_e20_c06_u133	Oh, I know...
s03_e20_c06_u134	Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
s03_e20_c06_u135	Isn't this great?!
s03_e20_c06_u136	Don't spoil it.
s03_e20_c07_u137	Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
s03_e20_c07_u138	(answering the phone) Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment! (He goes to take the call.)
s03_e20_c07_u139	(to Kate) That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
s03_e20_c07_u140	He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
s03_e20_c07_u141	Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
s03_e20_c07_u142	I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
s03_e20_c07_u143	Do you want me to want you to care?
s03_e20_c07_u144	Do you?
s03_e20_c07_u145	What?
s03_e20_c07_u146	(returning) Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
s03_e20_c07_u147	Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
s03_e20_c07_u148	I've got no reason to stay.
s03_e20_c07_u149	Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning. (exits)
s03_e20_c07_u150	I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
s03_e20_c07_u151	Hey, it's gonna be all right.
s03_e20_c07_u152	(to Joey) Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
s03_e20_c07_u153	What?
s03_e20_c07_u154	You know! At the place I told you about last night?
s03_e20_c07_u155	Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
s03_e20_c07_u156	Oh, okay.
s03_e20_c07_u157	Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)
s03_e20_c07_u158	I'll see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)
s03_e20_c07_u159	Okay.
s03_e20_c07_u160	G'night. (exits)
s03_e20_c07_u161	(to Kate) Ah, are you okay?
s03_e20_c07_u162	Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
s03_e20_c07_u163	I don't know.
s03_e20_c07_u164	Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
s03_e20_c07_u165	How do you mean?
s03_e20_c07_u166	Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
s03_e20_c07_u167	Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
s03_e20_c07_u168	Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
s03_e20_c07_u169	Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
s03_e20_c07_u170	And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
s03_e20_c07_u171	And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
s03_e20_c07_u172	And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
s03_e20_c07_u173	Something like that?
s03_e20_c07_u174	Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
s03_e20_c07_u175	Yeah.
s03_e20_c08_u176	(to Ross) Hey.
s03_e20_c08_u177	Hi.
s03_e20_c08_u178	(to Monica) Hey.
s03_e20_c08_u179	Hi.
s03_e20_c08_u180	Hey.
s03_e20_c08_u181	It's a little early to be drinkin'.
s03_e20_c08_u182	No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
s03_e20_c08_u183	Ohhhhh!
s03_e20_c08_u184	You're kidding?! That's great!
s03_e20_c08_u185	Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...
s03_e20_c08_u186	Oh my.
s03_e20_c08_u187	Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he's been processed by the devil, or something.)
s03_e20_c08_u188	(entering with Rachel) I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
s03_e20_c08_u189	Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
s03_e20_c08_u190	That's what you say at the end of a date.
s03_e20_c08_u191	You can't just say, Nice to meet you, good night?'
s03_e20_c08_u192	To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
s03_e20_c08_u193	Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
s03_e20_c08_u194	Well, they always called.
s03_e20_c08_u195	Hmm, bite me.
s03_e20_c09_u196	(entering) Did he call?
s03_e20_c09_u197	No. Sorry.
s03_e20_c09_u198	Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
s03_e20_c09_u199	Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
s03_e20_c09_u200	Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
s03_e20_c09_u201	Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
s03_e20_c09_u202	Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
s03_e20_c09_u203	Well...
s03_e20_c09_u204	The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
s03_e20_c09_u205	No. I...
s03_e20_c09_u206	Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
s03_e20_c10_u207	(grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!
s03_e20_c10_u208	Multiple, so many paper cuts.
s03_e20_c10_u209	Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
s03_e20_c10_u210	(sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.
s03_e20_c10_u211	Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
s03_e20_c10_u212	Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
s03_e20_c10_u213	Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
s03_e20_c10_u214	Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
s03_e20_c10_u215	I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
s03_e20_c10_u216	All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
s03_e20_c10_u217	That's fine!
s03_e20_c10_u218	That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
s03_e20_c10_u219	I know.
s03_e20_c11_u220	Mon?
s03_e20_c11_u221	(from the bathroom) I'm in the shower!
s03_e20_c11_u222	Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
s03_e20_c12_u223	Hey.
s03_e20_c12_u224	Hi.
s03_e20_c12_u225	So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
s03_e20_c12_u226	About what?
s03_e20_c12_u227	Y'know, about what happened with us.
s03_e20_c12_u228	Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
s03_e20_c12_u229	What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
s03_e20_c12_u230	Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
s03_e20_c12_u231	Nooo.
s03_e20_c12_u232	(entering) Hi, Kate!
s03_e20_c12_u233	Hi, Lauren.
s03_e20_c12_u234	Hi, Lauren.
s03_e20_c12_u235	Hi, pig!
s03_e20_c13_u236	Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
s03_e20_c13_u237	Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
s03_e20_c13_u238	Yeah.
s03_e20_c13_u239	(entering) Hey!
s03_e20_c13_u240	(runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
s03_e20_c13_u241	What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!
s03_e20_c13_u242	Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.
s03_e20_c13_u243	All right. Did everyone get out okay?
s03_e20_c13_u244	Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
s03_e20_c13_u245	Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)
s03_e20_c13_u246	No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
s03_e20_c13_u247	(She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
s03_e20_c14_u248	It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, (points to his eye) and it's all the time.
s03_e20_c14_u249	Well, thanks again for lunch.
s03_e20_c14_u250	(He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.
s03_e20_c14_u251	It was, wasn't it?
s03_e20_c14_u252	The food there was, was great.
s03_e20_c14_u253	Wasn't it?
s03_e20_c14_u254	So take care.
s03_e20_c14_u255	You too.
s03_e20_c14_u256	Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)
s03_e20_c14_u257	Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
s03_e20_c14_u258	Sophie's desk.
s03_e20_c14_u259	(whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
s03_e20_c14_u260	Noo!
s03_e20_c14_u261	Chandler!!
s03_e20_c14_u262	Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
s03_e20_c14_u263	Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)
s03_e20_c14_u264	Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
s03_e20_c14_u265	What?
s03_e20_c14_u266	I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
s03_e20_c14_u267	Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
s03_e20_c14_u268	Yeah, o-okay.
s03_e20_c14_u269	So...
s03_e20_c14_u270	Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
s03_e20_c15_u271	(on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she's not home huh? (listens) Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
s03_e12_c01_u001	(running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
s03_e12_c01_u002	Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
s03_e12_c01_u003	(to Ross) Tell him.
s03_e12_c01_u004	(to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
s03_e12_c01_u005	All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
s03_e12_c01_u006	Why?
s03_e12_c01_u007	I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
s03_e12_c01_u008	Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
s03_e12_c01_u009	Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
s03_e12_c01_u010	Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)
s03_e12_c01_u011	(entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
s03_e12_c01_u012	(to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.
s03_e12_c01_u013	(running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
s03_e12_c01_u014	Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
s03_e12_c01_u015	No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
s03_e12_c01_u016	Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
s03_e12_c01_u017	Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
s03_e12_c01_u018	Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
s03_e12_c01_u019	Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?
s03_e12_c01_u020	Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
s03_e12_c01_u021	Oh.
s03_e12_c01_u022	(to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
s03_e12_c01_u023	What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
s03_e12_c01_u024	Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
s03_e12_c01_u025	A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliche. Why don't you get a magician?!
s03_e12_c01_u026	Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
s03_e12_c02_u027	She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do?
s03_e12_c02_u028	Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.
s03_e12_c02_u029	(hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
s03_e12_c02_u030	I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
s03_e12_c02_u031	It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
s03_e12_c02_u032	Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
s03_e12_c02_u033	What?
s03_e12_c02_u034	Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
s03_e12_c02_u035	Who?
s03_e12_c02_u036	I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
s03_e12_c02_u037	The what?
s03_e12_c02_u038	The abridgment.
s03_e12_c02_u039	Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what?
s03_e12_c03_u040	...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?
s03_e12_c03_u041	Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
s03_e12_c03_u042	Twenty percent.
s03_e12_c03_u043	Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call.
s03_e12_c03_u044	Here, let me. (answers phone) Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?
s03_e12_c03_u045	(on phone) Hi, is Rachel there?
s03_e12_c03_u046	And who may I say is calling?
s03_e12_c03_u047	This is Ross?
s03_e12_c03_u048	Ross of.....
s03_e12_c03_u049	Of Ross and Rachel.
s03_e12_c03_u050	Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.
s03_e12_c03_u051	Oh hey, hey Mark.
s03_e12_c03_u052	Hey, hold on a second.
s03_e12_c03_u053	Okay.
s03_e12_c03_u054	Hi honey!
s03_e12_c03_u055	Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?
s03_e12_c03_u056	Oh, he's just goofing around.
s03_e12_c03_u057	Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
s03_e12_c03_u058	Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
s03_e12_c03_u059	Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
s03_e12_c03_u060	Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
s03_e12_c03_u061	What?
s03_e12_c03_u062	I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. (to Mark) Mark, I need you!
s03_e12_c03_u063	Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.)
s03_e12_c03_u064	Ow! Ross!!
s03_e12_c03_u065	Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number. (hangs up)
s03_e12_c04_u066	(to Monica) All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
s03_e12_c04_u067	Please, I'm not going for anything.
s03_e12_c04_u068	Well, if you don't, I will.
s03_e12_c04_u069	Would you please go?
s03_e12_c04_u070	Night Mon. Night Julio.
s03_e12_c04_u071	(to Jeannine) Adios.
s03_e12_c04_u072	Look Julio, someone left their book here.
s03_e12_c04_u073	Ah actually, that is mine.
s03_e12_c04_u074	Oh yeah, what are you reading?
s03_e12_c04_u075	Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
s03_e12_c04_u076	Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it?
s03_e12_c04_u077	I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
s03_e12_c04_u078	Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I can't believe I just said that.')
s03_e12_c04_u079	Actually I ah, I am a poet.
s03_e12_c04_u080	Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write about?
s03_e12_c04_u081	Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip. (points to her lip)
s03_e12_c04_u082	Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here?
s03_e12_c04_u083	I can write an epic poem about this lip. (grabs her lower lip)
s03_e12_c04_u084	How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
s03_e12_c05_u085	(singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
s03_e12_c05_u086	Lovely, just lovely.
s03_e12_c05_u087	Really? Thanks.
s03_e12_c05_u088	Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
s03_e12_c05_u089	Excellent, I'll be there.
s03_e12_c05_u090	Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
s03_e12_c05_u091	Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
s03_e12_c05_u092	Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
s03_e12_c06_u093	....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
s03_e12_c06_u094	Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
s03_e12_c06_u095	Well, can you dance at all?
s03_e12_c06_u096	Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)
s03_e12_c06_u097	Oh no, no, no, no.
s03_e12_c06_u098	(covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that?
s03_e12_c06_u099	Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
s03_e12_c06_u100	All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
s03_e12_c06_u101	(entering) Hi!
s03_e12_c06_u102	Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
s03_e12_c06_u103	It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
s03_e12_c06_u104	Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
s03_e12_c06_u105	Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
s03_e12_c06_u106	Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
s03_e12_c06_u107	Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. (hands them the poem)
s03_e12_c06_u108	(reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
s03_e12_c06_u109	To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
s03_e12_c06_u110	Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
s03_e12_c06_u111	Oh yeah.
s03_e12_c06_u112	Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work. (tries to take the poem)
s03_e12_c06_u113	Whoa, I'm not done.
s03_e12_c06_u114	All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
s03_e12_c06_u115	Bye-bye.
s03_e12_c06_u116	Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
s03_e12_c06_u117	What, what, what?!
s03_e12_c06_u118	What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
s03_e12_c06_u119	You really think that is what he meant?
s03_e12_c06_u120	Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
s03_e12_c06_u121	Done.
s03_e12_c07_u122	(reaching through the flowers) Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
s03_e12_c07_u123	Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play the theme from Love Story)
s03_e12_c07_u124	Wh-what's that?
s03_e12_c07_u125	It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
s03_e12_c07_u126	Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
s03_e12_c07_u127	Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
s03_e12_c07_u128	(to Rachel) Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
s03_e12_c07_u129	Yes.
s03_e12_c07_u130	(being joined by the rest of the barbershop quartet) One, two, three...
s03_e12_c07_u131	(singing) Congratulations on your first week at your brand new job! It won't be long before your the boss.
s03_e12_c07_u132	Omm-pah, omm-pah, omm-pah.
s03_e12_c07_u133	(singing) And you know who will be there to support... you?! Your one and only boyfriend...
s03_e12_c07_u134	It's nice to have a boyfriend.
s03_e12_c07_u135	Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
s03_e12_c08_u136	I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
s03_e12_c08_u137	All right Ross!! I get it!!
s03_e12_c08_u138	I mean my God...
s03_e12_c08_u139	You're hurt!
s03_e12_c08_u140	...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
s03_e12_c08_u141	Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
s03_e12_c08_u142	I would never do that!
s03_e12_c08_u143	Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
s03_e12_c08_u144	Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
s03_e12_c09_u145	Mark's a genius!
s03_e12_c09_u146	Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
s03_e12_c09_u147	Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
s03_e12_c09_u148	What am I going to do?
s03_e12_c09_u149	Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
s03_e12_c09_u150	I don't know you guys.
s03_e12_c09_u151	All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
s03_e12_c09_u152	And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
s03_e12_c09_u153	He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
s03_e12_c10_u154	(walking up to Mark) Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
s03_e12_c10_u155	(turning around) And wait, I've got something for you. (kisses her)
s03_e12_c10_u156	Mark!!
s03_e12_c10_u157	It's okay, Rachel knows.
s03_e12_c10_u158	Yeah, but even soo.
s03_e12_c10_u159	I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
s03_e12_c10_u160	Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee)
s03_e12_c10_u161	Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
s03_e12_c10_u162	All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
s03_e12_c10_u163	What is going on?
s03_e12_c10_u164	What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!!
s03_e12_c10_u165	(now standing behind Ross) Ross!
s03_e12_c10_u166	I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand on her shoulder and she knocks it away.)
s03_e12_c11_u167	Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
s03_e12_c11_u168	So, does that mean the audition is off?
s03_e12_c11_u169	Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
s03_e12_c11_u170	What?!
s03_e12_c11_u171	Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, (very quickly, Joey watches stunned) up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
s03_e12_c11_u172	It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
s03_e12_c11_u173	Have fun.
s03_e12_c11_u174	Bye. (does the jazz hands)
s03_e12_c12_u175	(entering) Hey!
s03_e12_c12_u176	Hey.
s03_e12_c12_u177	What are you wrapping?
s03_e12_c12_u178	Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
s03_e12_c12_u179	Yeah, it's a vase.
s03_e12_c12_u180	Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
s03_e12_c12_u181	Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
s03_e12_c12_u182	What do you mean?
s03_e12_c12_u183	Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)
s03_e12_c13_u184	(to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
s03_e12_c13_u185	What?
s03_e12_c13_u186	Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
s03_e12_c13_u187	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
s03_e12_c13_u188	You don't even know me...
s03_e12_c13_u189	Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
s03_e12_c13_u190	What?
s03_e12_c13_u191	The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
s03_e12_c13_u192	I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
s03_e12_c13_u193	No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
s03_e12_c13_u194	(sarcastically) Oh yeah.
s03_e12_c14_u195	All right, let's do it!
s03_e12_c14_u196	No, no, no. What was that?
s03_e12_c14_u197	I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
s03_e12_c14_u198	Well, people!
s03_e12_c14_u199	People, people, people.
s03_e12_c14_u200	Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. (to Joey) Show 'em how it's done. (to the pianist) Count it off.
s03_e12_c15_u201	So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
s03_e12_c15_u202	Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?
s03_e12_c15_u203	Right.
s03_e12_c15_u204	And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)
s03_e12_c15_u205	(entering) Hi.
s03_e12_c15_u206	Hello.
s03_e12_c15_u207	Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
s03_e12_c15_u208	(sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
s03_e12_c15_u209	A big idiot.
s03_e12_c15_u210	A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
s03_e12_c15_u211	Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
s03_e12_c15_u212	Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
s03_e12_c15_u213	Let it be me! Let it be me!
s03_e12_c15_u214	Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)
s03_e12_c15_u215	I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
s03_e12_c15_u216	Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
s03_e12_c15_u217	Where ya going?
s03_e12_c15_u218	Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
s03_e12_c15_u219	Ohh, with who?
s03_e12_c15_u220	Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
s03_e12_c15_u221	There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?!
s03_e12_c15_u222	Yeah.
s03_e12_c15_u223	You have a play date with a stripper?!
s03_e12_c15_u224	Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)
s03_e12_c15_u225	Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
s03_e12_c15_u226	Sure, is she married?
s03_e12_c15_u227	Ahh, no.
s03_e12_c15_u228	Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)
s03_e12_c15_u229	Are you jealous?
s03_e12_c15_u230	Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
s03_e12_c15_u231	You are totally jealous.
s03_e12_c15_u232	I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
s03_e12_c15_u233	Honey, I love you too.
s03_e12_c15_u234	Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
s03_e12_c15_u235	What?
s03_e12_c15_u236	Huh.
s03_e12_c15_u237	(to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
s03_e12_c15_u238	Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
s03_e12_c16_u239	(entering) Is there a Julio here?
s03_e12_c16_u240	(to him) I am Julio.
s03_e12_c16_u241	(singing) Mister Pretensous, (Monica stands up in the background) you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
s03_e12_c16_u242	Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
s03_e12_c16_u243	No one likes a buttmunch.
s03_e12_c16_u244	And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
s04_e09_c01_u001	Okay!
s04_e09_c01_u002	Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes.)
s04_e09_c01_u003	Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
s04_e09_c01_u004	Okayyyyy, open up!
s04_e09_c01_u005	What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
s04_e09_c01_u006	Yeah, it's for our catering business!
s04_e09_c01_u007	I think I know that girl.
s04_e09_c01_u008	All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
s04_e09_c01_u009	No?
s04_e09_c01_u010	No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
s04_e09_c01_u011	Oh!
s04_e09_c01_u012	And also, we don't know what to do with this. (She turns on a switch and the girl's nipples light up.)
s04_e09_c01_u013	Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
s04_e09_c02_u014	(to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
s04_e09_c02_u015	Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
s04_e09_c02_u016	Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
s04_e09_c02_u017	Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence- dozens of people.
s04_e09_c02_u018	How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
s04_e09_c02_u019	Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
s04_e09_c02_u020	Yay!!
s04_e09_c02_u021	Oh, in that case-(hops up and down in joy)-Yay! (Monica looks confused) That was me hopping on board.
s04_e09_c02_u022	Oh.
s04_e09_c02_u023	(entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
s04_e09_c02_u024	I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
s04_e09_c02_u025	No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
s04_e09_c02_u026	Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
s04_e09_c02_u027	Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
s04_e09_c02_u028	Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
s04_e09_c02_u029	Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
s04_e09_c02_u030	Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
s04_e09_c02_u031	I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
s04_e09_c02_u032	I'm gonna call after you!
s04_e09_c02_u033	This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
s04_e09_c02_u034	Woooo!!!
s04_e09_c02_u035	All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
s04_e09_c02_u036	Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
s04_e09_c02_u037	Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
s04_e09_c02_u038	Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
s04_e09_c02_u039	Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
s04_e09_c02_u040	No, I had sex in high school.
s04_e09_c03_u041	Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss
s04_e09_c03_u042	(interrupting) Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
s04_e09_c03_u043	Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and
s04_e09_c03_u044	Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
s04_e09_c03_u045	God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
s04_e09_c03_u046	Really? Well, in that case
s04_e09_c03_u047	(interrupting) And that's I'm so glad- there's no problem.
s04_e09_c03_u048	That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
s04_e09_c03_u049	Ohh! That's great!
s04_e09_c03_u050	You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
s04_e09_c03_u051	Really?!
s04_e09_c03_u052	No-ho-ho! (pause) Yeah. (pause) I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
s04_e09_c03_u053	Well, I, umm
s04_e09_c03_u054	Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
s04_e09_c04_u055	Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
s04_e09_c04_u056	Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
s04_e09_c04_u057	Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
s04_e09_c04_u058	Really?!
s04_e09_c04_u059	Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
s04_e09_c04_u060	(entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
s04_e09_c04_u061	It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
s04_e09_c04_u062	All right, I'll see you guys.
s04_e09_c04_u063	Whoa-whoa-whoa!
s04_e09_c04_u064	Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
s04_e09_c04_u065	I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
s04_e09_c04_u066	Somewhere maybe along the equator?
s04_e09_c04_u067	Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)
s04_e09_c04_u068	(answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It's Gandolf!!! (on phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then. (Hangs up)
s04_e09_c04_u069	What happened?
s04_e09_c04_u070	He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
s04_e09_c04_u071	Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
s04_e09_c04_u072	Stupid, useless Canadian money!
s04_e09_c05_u073	You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
s04_e09_c05_u074	Thank you.
s04_e09_c05_u075	Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? (to the committee) It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
s04_e09_c05_u076	Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
s04_e09_c05_u077	I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
s04_e09_c05_u078	Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
s04_e09_c05_u079	Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
s04_e09_c05_u080	I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
s04_e09_c05_u081	Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. (to the committee) Rachel can carry two things at once!
s04_e09_c05_u082	Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
s04_e09_c05_u083	Yes, I realize that
s04_e09_c05_u084	(interrupting) And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
s04_e09_c05_u085	I love working with designers!
s04_e09_c05_u086	With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
s04_e09_c06_u087	Hey! My first review is out!
s04_e09_c06_u088	Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
s04_e09_c06_u089	All right, look at my on the back page.
s04_e09_c06_u090	Oh, okay! (reading) "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.
s04_e09_c06_u091	Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
s04_e09_c06_u092	Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
s04_e09_c06_u093	Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
s04_e09_c06_u094	No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
s04_e09_c06_u095	Haven't we made this decision?
s04_e09_c06_u096	Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)
s04_e09_c06_u097	Bye!
s04_e09_c06_u098	Bye!
s04_e09_c06_u099	(answering it) Who is it?
s04_e09_c06_u100	It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
s04_e09_c06_u101	Oh my God.
s04_e09_c06_u102	I want to talk to you about your review.
s04_e09_c06_u103	Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!
s04_e09_c06_u104	Why? So you could hang up on me?
s04_e09_c06_u105	Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
s04_e09_c06_u106	Just give me a chance too
s04_e09_c06_u107	(on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
s04_e09_c06_u108	No! Phoebe!
s04_e09_c06_u109	Hey, Monica!
s04_e09_c07_u110	(entering) I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
s04_e09_c07_u111	I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
s04_e09_c07_u112	Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
s04_e09_c07_u113	The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
s04_e09_c07_u114	Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
s04_e09_c07_u115	All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
s04_e09_c07_u116	Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
s04_e09_c07_u117	Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
s04_e09_c07_u118	(shyly) Lebanon.
s04_e09_c07_u119	Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
s04_e09_c07_u120	How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
s04_e09_c08_u121	(entering Joanna's office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
s04_e09_c08_u122	I thought it went very well.
s04_e09_c08_u123	No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) Now, just to brief you- (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
s04_e09_c08_u124	Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
s04_e09_c08_u125	There's nobody here!
s04_e09_c08_u126	Sophie, get in here! (Sophie enters) You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
s04_e09_c08_u127	She's not making me uncomfortable.
s04_e09_c08_u128	Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out. (Sophie starts to cry and leaves)
s04_e09_c08_u129	Do you want me to quit?
s04_e09_c08_u130	What?! What would make you think that?
s04_e09_c08_u131	Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes she has nothing.) Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around til the end of the day! (Starts to leave.)
s04_e09_c08_u132	Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
s04_e09_c08_u133	What?
s04_e09_c08_u134	That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking
s04_e09_c08_u135	My drinking?
s04_e09_c08_u136	Oh, I must've said that after you left.
s04_e09_c08_u137	Said what? Exactly.
s04_e09_c08_u138	That you enjoyed the occasional drink-ing binge.
s04_e09_c08_u139	Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
s04_e09_c08_u140	Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
s04_e09_c08_u141	Say more things like that.
s04_e09_c08_u142	You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
s04_e09_c08_u143	I'd need an expense account.
s04_e09_c08_u144	Done!
s04_e09_c08_u145	And an assistant.
s04_e09_c08_u146	Sophie, get in here! (Sophie peeks in around the corner)
s04_e09_c09_u147	Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
s04_e09_c09_u148	It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
s04_e09_c09_u149	So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
s04_e09_c09_u150	No! I balanced my checkbook.
s04_e09_c09_u151	Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
s04_e09_c09_u152	I can't believe he didn't come!
s04_e09_c09_u153	So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
s04_e09_c09_u154	Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
s04_e09_c09_u155	Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
s04_e09_c09_u156	Well, we could do that!
s04_e09_c09_u157	There's other stuff too.
s04_e09_c09_u158	We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
s04_e09_c09_u159	Yeah!
s04_e09_c09_u160	Yeah!
s04_e09_c09_u161	Yeah!!
s04_e09_c09_u162	Yeah!!
s04_e09_c09_u163	It's not like we don't know how to party!!
s04_e09_c09_u164	Yeah! All right? Let's go!
s04_e09_c09_u165	And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
s04_e09_c09_u166	Yeah!!!
s04_e09_c09_u167	All right!!
s04_e09_c09_u168	(to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
s04_e09_c09_u169	Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
s04_e09_c09_u170	Yeah.
s04_e09_c09_u171	Well, those were seals, man.
s04_e09_c10_u172	Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
s04_e09_c10_u173	Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
s04_e09_c10_u174	Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
s04_e09_c10_u175	Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
s04_e09_c10_u176	Ohh, you've waited soo long.
s04_e09_c10_u177	(entering) Hey!
s04_e09_c10_u178	Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
s04_e09_c10_u179	Yeah.
s04_e09_c10_u180	How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
s04_e09_c10_u181	I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and- (realizes) You got the job!!
s04_e09_c10_u182	Yes!!!
s04_e09_c10_u183	You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
s04_e09_c10_u184	Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica) I'm gonna have walls!
s04_e09_c10_u185	Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
s04_e09_c10_u186	Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
s04_e09_c10_u187	But we've only had one job.
s04_e09_c10_u188	I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
s04_e09_c10_u189	Yeah! What are you saying?
s04_e09_c10_u190	I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
s04_e09_c10_u191	What?
s04_e09_c10_u192	It's okay, cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
s04_e09_c10_u193	You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
s04_e09_c10_u194	All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
s04_e09_c10_u195	For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves)
s04_e09_c10_u196	Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)
s04_e09_c10_u197	I'm an assistant buyer!!
s04_e09_c11_u198	All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
s04_e09_c11_u199	Yeah, all right.
s04_e09_c11_u200	Okay.
s04_e09_c11_u201	So, we're having fun, right?
s04_e09_c11_u202	Yeah.
s04_e09_c11_u203	We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
s04_e09_c11_u204	I'm kinda beat.
s04_e09_c11_u205	Actually, me too.
s04_e09_c11_u206	Are you serious?!
s04_e09_c11_u207	Yeah.
s04_e09_c11_u208	Thank God! I'm exhausted!
s04_e09_c11_u209	So you guys want coffees?
s04_e09_c11_u210	Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
s04_e09_c11_u211	Yeah, me too.
s04_e09_c11_u212	Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
s04_e09_c11_u213	I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
s04_e09_c11_u214	I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
s04_e09_c11_u215	How sad are we?
s04_e09_c11_u216	Yeah, I know.
s04_e09_c11_u217	Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
s04_e09_c11_u218	Yeah!
s04_e09_c11_u219	Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
s04_e09_c11_u220	Yeah!
s04_e09_c11_u221	And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
s04_e09_c11_u222	We're 29, we're not women.
s04_e09_c12_u223	(entering) Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
s04_e09_c12_u224	Okay, I'm hearing.
s04_e09_c12_u225	I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
s04_e09_c12_u226	What?!
s04_e09_c12_u227	Or! A bakery delivery person.
s04_e09_c12_u228	I wa-I wa-I wa
s04_e09_c12_u229	Pizza?!
s04_e09_c12_u230	Monica!
s04_e09_c12_u231	All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
s04_e09_c12_u232	No.
s04_e09_c12_u233	Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
s04_e09_c12_u234	No.
s04_e09_c12_u235	Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
s04_e09_c12_u236	Really?! Are you sure?
s04_e09_c12_u237	Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
s04_e09_c12_u238	Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
s04_e09_c12_u239	Really?!
s04_e09_c12_u240	Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
s04_e09_c12_u241	Thank you.
s04_e09_c12_u242	Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
s04_e09_c13_u243	Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
s04_e09_c13_u244	Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
s04_e09_c13_u245	Heard what?
s04_e09_c13_u246	Joanna passed away last night.
s04_e09_c13_u247	Oh my God! How?!
s04_e09_c13_u248	Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
s04_e09_c13_u249	Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
s04_e09_c13_u250	I know!
s04_e09_c13_u251	Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.
s04_e09_c13_u252	I didn't realize that she was so close.
s04_e09_c13_u253	Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before- it happened.
s04_e09_c13_u254	No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
s04_e09_c13_u255	Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?
s04_e09_c13_u256	(starting to cry) No, I'm sorry. I have to go. (She leaves as Sophie arrives.)
s04_e09_c13_u257	(happily) Good morning!
s04_e09_c13_u258	Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna
s04_e09_c13_u259	I sure did! (smiles)
s04_e09_c14_u260	I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
s04_e09_c14_u261	Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?
s10_e02_c01_u001	Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
s10_e02_c01_u002	We weren't doing anything!
s10_e02_c01_u003	Rach, he just saw us.
s10_e02_c01_u004	Shhh.
s10_e02_c01_u005	But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
s10_e02_c01_u006	No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
s10_e02_c01_u007	Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
s10_e02_c01_u008	Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
s10_e02_c01_u009	We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
s10_e02_c01_u010	Yeah, but it did happen, so...
s10_e02_c01_u011	Ross?
s10_e02_c01_u012	Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?
s10_e02_c02_u013	Ross, say something. Anything.
s10_e02_c02_u014	So you two are..?
s10_e02_c02_u015	And have you .. ed?
s10_e02_c02_u016	No, no, no!
s10_e02_c02_u017	No, no, no!
s10_e02_c02_u018	But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
s10_e02_c02_u019	Probably.
s10_e02_c02_u020	No, no!
s10_e02_c02_u021	Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
s10_e02_c02_u022	I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
s10_e02_c02_u023	No, but you know what I mean.
s10_e02_c02_u024	Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. (Squeaky.) I'm fine!
s10_e02_c02_u025	Really?
s10_e02_c02_u026	Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice) I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
s10_e02_c02_u027	Ross..
s10_e02_c02_u028	It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
s10_e02_c02_u029	Calm ourselves?
s10_e02_c02_u030	No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
s10_e02_c02_u031	Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
s10_e02_c02_u032	Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms off.)
s10_e02_c02_u033	I do like fajitas.
s10_e02_c03_u034	God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
s10_e02_c03_u035	There's a hair in my coffee.
s10_e02_c03_u036	Hey guys!
s10_e02_c03_u037	Hey.
s10_e02_c03_u038	Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
s10_e02_c03_u039	You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
s10_e02_c03_u040	That's sweet. Drink your hair.
s10_e02_c03_u041	Hey, what's all this stuff?
s10_e02_c03_u042	Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
s10_e02_c03_u043	Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
s10_e02_c03_u044	That's not really how it works.
s10_e02_c03_u045	Oh, how does it work?
s10_e02_c03_u046	I don't know!
s10_e02_c03_u047	Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
s10_e02_c03_u048	Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
s10_e02_c03_u049	Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
s10_e02_c03_u050	That's not what we talked about!!
s10_e02_c03_u051	Hey!
s10_e02_c03_u052	Hey.
s10_e02_c03_u053	Good to see you.
s10_e02_c03_u054	Good to see you, too.
s10_e02_c03_u055	Hi Frank.
s10_e02_c03_u056	Hi, how you doin'?
s10_e02_c03_u057	Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
s10_e02_c03_u058	Which one is which again?
s10_e02_c03_u059	Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
s10_e02_c04_u060	Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
s10_e02_c04_u061	Well, what would we be doing?
s10_e02_c04_u062	I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
s10_e02_c04_u063	Feel me up?
s10_e02_c04_u064	In a carriage!
s10_e02_c04_u065	Hey, Charlie!
s10_e02_c04_u066	Hey.
s10_e02_c04_u067	Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
s10_e02_c04_u068	Oh, you bet.
s10_e02_c04_u069	So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
s10_e02_c04_u070	Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
s10_e02_c04_u071	Oh. Oh, thanks.
s10_e02_c04_u072	And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
s10_e02_c04_u073	Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
s10_e02_c04_u074	I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.
s10_e02_c04_u075	Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
s10_e02_c04_u076	Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)
s10_e02_c04_u077	Uh, actually, that's..
s10_e02_c04_u078	Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
s10_e02_c04_u079	Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
s10_e02_c04_u080	What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
s10_e02_c04_u081	Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
s10_e02_c04_u082	You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
s10_e02_c05_u083	Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
s10_e02_c05_u084	Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
s10_e02_c05_u085	Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
s10_e02_c05_u086	Yeah.
s10_e02_c05_u087	Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
s10_e02_c05_u088	I haven't slept in four years!
s10_e02_c05_u089	That's a, that's a long time.
s10_e02_c05_u090	You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
s10_e02_c05_u091	Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
s10_e02_c05_u092	Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
s10_e02_c05_u093	What?
s10_e02_c05_u094	No, I can't.
s10_e02_c05_u095	Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
s10_e02_c05_u096	Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
s10_e02_c05_u097	What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
s10_e02_c06_u098	Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
s10_e02_c06_u099	Oh, please, we're happy to help.
s10_e02_c06_u100	We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
s10_e02_c06_u101	So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
s10_e02_c06_u102	I mean, you have a lovely home.
s10_e02_c06_u103	Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
s10_e02_c06_u104	Well, actually, I think this might help.
s10_e02_c06_u105	It's pretty much all the information you need.
s10_e02_c06_u106	Oh my god!
s10_e02_c06_u107	Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
s10_e02_c06_u108	Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
s10_e02_c06_u109	I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
s10_e02_c06_u110	That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
s10_e02_c06_u111	You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
s10_e02_c06_u112	It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
s10_e02_c06_u113	The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
s10_e02_c06_u114	I would have told him to do it too.
s10_e02_c06_u115	Can I adopt you?
s10_e02_c06_u116	Hey, you must be Owen.
s10_e02_c06_u117	Yeah.
s10_e02_c06_u118	I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
s10_e02_c06_u119	You were?
s10_e02_c06_u120	Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
s10_e02_c06_u121	Huh?
s10_e02_c06_u122	You know how to use a compass?
s10_e02_c06_u123	I have a badge in it.
s10_e02_c06_u124	You do? That's fantastic!
s10_e02_c06_u125	You wanna see it?
s10_e02_c06_u126	I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
s10_e02_c06_u127	What?!?
s10_e02_c06_u128	What?
s10_e02_c06_u129	I'm adopted?
s10_e02_c06_u130	I got nothing.
s10_e02_c07_u131	The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
s10_e02_c07_u132	Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
s10_e02_c07_u133	Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
s10_e02_c07_u134	Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
s10_e02_c07_u135	I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
s10_e02_c07_u136	No awareness.
s10_e02_c07_u137	We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
s10_e02_c07_u138	My fajitas!!
s10_e02_c07_u139	Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
s10_e02_c07_u140	Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
s10_e02_c07_u141	Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
s10_e02_c07_u142	Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
s10_e02_c07_u143	Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
s10_e02_c07_u144	That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
s10_e02_c08_u145	Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
s10_e02_c08_u146	No, of course we're not.
s10_e02_c08_u147	Insane.
s10_e02_c08_u148	I know.
s10_e02_c08_u149	Alice would never go for it, right?
s10_e02_c08_u150	Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
s10_e02_c08_u151	Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
s10_e02_c08_u152	Huh.
s10_e02_c08_u153	Frank Jr.Jr.?
s10_e02_c08_u154	Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
s10_e02_c08_u155	Uh-huh.
s10_e02_c08_u156	What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
s10_e02_c08_u157	Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
s10_e02_c08_u158	Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
s10_e02_c08_u159	Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
s10_e02_c08_u160	Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
s10_e02_c08_u161	Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
s10_e02_c08_u162	Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
s10_e02_c08_u163	I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
s10_e02_c08_u164	How about tomorrow?
s10_e02_c08_u165	Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
s10_e02_c08_u166	You'd do that for us?
s10_e02_c08_u167	Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
s10_e02_c09_u168	Where are Bill and Colleen?
s10_e02_c09_u169	They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
s10_e02_c09_u170	We have to leave!!
s10_e02_c09_u171	Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
s10_e02_c09_u172	I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
s10_e02_c09_u173	Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
s10_e02_c09_u174	Hey.
s10_e02_c09_u175	Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
s10_e02_c09_u176	I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
s10_e02_c09_u177	But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
s10_e02_c09_u178	I'm adopted?!
s10_e02_c09_u179	See? Intuitive!
s10_e02_c09_u180	What? Where did you hear that?
s10_e02_c09_u181	He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
s10_e02_c09_u182	Which technically now you should give back!
s10_e02_c09_u183	You told him he's adopted?
s10_e02_c09_u184	I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
s10_e02_c09_u185	He isn't?!
s10_e02_c10_u186	Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
s10_e02_c10_u187	Ooy.
s10_e02_c10_u188	And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
s10_e02_c10_u189	Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
s10_e02_c10_u190	O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
s10_e02_c10_u191	Dude, are you okay?
s10_e02_c10_u192	Totally.
s10_e02_c10_u193	Ross, you don't seem okay.
s10_e02_c10_u194	Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
s10_e02_c10_u195	No!
s10_e02_c10_u196	I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
s10_e02_c10_u197	Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
s10_e02_c10_u198	You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
s10_e02_c10_u199	Okay.
s10_e02_c10_u200	Alright.
s10_e02_c10_u201	God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
s10_e02_c10_u202	Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
s10_e02_c10_u203	Bye.
s10_e02_c10_u204	Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
s10_e02_c10_u205	You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
s10_e02_c10_u206	Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
s10_e02_c10_u207	No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
s10_e02_c10_u208	Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
s10_e02_c10_u209	I don't even know what that's for.
s10_e02_c10_u210	You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
s10_e02_c10_u211	Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
s10_e02_c10_u212	Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
s10_e02_c10_u213	Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
s10_e02_c10_u214	It doesn't look good, does it?
s10_e02_c11_u215	Morning. Here you go.
s10_e02_c11_u216	Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
s10_e02_c11_u217	Yeah.
s10_e02_c11_u218	So you took off my pants and shoes?
s10_e02_c11_u219	No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
s10_e02_c11_u220	What do you mean?
s10_e02_c11_u221	Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
s10_e02_c11_u222	Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
s10_e02_c11_u223	It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
s10_e02_c11_u224	Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
s10_e02_c11_u225	That's what I hear, yeah.
s10_e02_c11_u226	This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
s10_e02_c11_u227	Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
s10_e02_c11_u228	Joey.
s10_e02_c11_u229	I'm crazy about her.
s10_e02_c11_u230	And she feels the same way?
s10_e02_c11_u231	I think so.
s10_e02_c11_u232	Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
s10_e02_c11_u233	Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
s10_e02_c11_u234	No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
s10_e02_c11_u235	No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
s10_e02_c11_u236	Yeah, I'm sure.
s10_e02_c11_u237	And we're okay?
s10_e02_c12_u238	Hey, Phoebs
s10_e02_c12_u239	Hey.
s10_e02_c12_u240	Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
s10_e02_c12_u241	Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
s10_e02_c12_u242	What?
s10_e02_c12_u243	Still, he had to find out sometime.
s10_e02_c12_u244	Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
s10_e02_c12_u245	I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)
s07_e04_c01_u001	(on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel, Chandler, and Monica aren't amused.)
s07_e04_c01_u002	You can say that again Mac.
s07_e04_c01_u003	Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
s07_e04_c01_u004	Oh yeah? Well then how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
s07_e04_c01_u005	(laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?
s07_e04_c01_u006	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom. (Hands him the phone.)
s07_e04_c01_u007	It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
s07_e04_c01_u008	Ohhhh
s07_e04_c01_u009	That's nice.
s07_e04_c01_u010	(on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what they're gonna say.)
s07_e04_c01_u011	Well that was umm-Okay.
s07_e04_c01_u012	It wasn't the best.
s07_e04_c01_u013	That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
s07_e04_c01_u014	Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
s07_e04_c01_u015	Well, the lighting was okay.
s07_e04_c01_u016	Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
s07_e04_c01_u017	And I have costumes.
s07_e04_c01_u018	Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"
s07_e04_c01_u019	What are you gonna do Pheebs?
s07_e04_c01_u020	I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
s07_e04_c01_u021	And say nothing?
s07_e04_c01_u022	Uh-huh, yeah that's right.
s07_e04_c01_u023	(hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It wasn't that good.
s07_e04_c02_u024	Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
s07_e04_c02_u025	What? You mean behind my back?
s07_e04_c02_u026	(entering, excitedly) Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and
s07_e04_c02_u027	(entering from bathrooms excitedly) You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
s07_e04_c02_u028	Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
s07_e04_c02_u029	Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
s07_e04_c02_u030	Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.

s07_e04_c02_u032	Joey!
s07_e04_c02_u033	Oh, you weren't finished?
s07_e04_c02_u034	Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
s07_e04_c02_u035	Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.
s07_e04_c02_u036	It's the same story.
s07_e04_c02_u037	(groans in disgust) Wow, it's really long.
s07_e04_c02_u038	(ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
s07_e04_c02_u039	Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
s07_e04_c02_u040	Yeah!
s07_e04_c02_u041	I'm so happy for you!
s07_e04_c02_u042	Well, these really are the days of our lives.
s07_e04_c02_u043	What?!
s07_e04_c02_u044	Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
s07_e04_c02_u045	(gasps) Oh God!
s07_e04_c02_u046	I got-I get a big pay raise!
s07_e04_c02_u047	Oh hey!
s07_e04_c02_u048	I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!
s07_e04_c02_u049	Oooh!
s07_e04_c02_u050	I get to hire my own assistant!
s07_e04_c02_u051	(jumps up) Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
s07_e04_c03_u052	(reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?
s07_e04_c03_u053	That's right.
s07_e04_c03_u054	Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?
s07_e04_c03_u055	What?
s07_e04_c03_u056	I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.
s07_e04_c03_u057	No dear. It's not.
s07_e04_c03_u058	No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
s07_e04_c03_u059	Thank you! Good meeting you.
s07_e04_c03_u060	All right. (Hilda exits) I'm a total pro!
s07_e04_c03_u061	(seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.
s07_e04_c03_u062	Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?
s07_e04_c03_u063	Uh-huh, go on.
s07_e04_c03_u064	That's it. That's my whole name.
s07_e04_c03_u065	That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)
s07_e04_c03_u066	I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh
s07_e04_c03_u067	Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!
s07_e04_c03_u068	It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn
s07_e04_c03_u069	Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
s07_e04_c04_u070	No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
s07_e04_c04_u071	(To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
s07_e04_c04_u072	(To Chandler) Hey sweetie.
s07_e04_c04_u073	Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
s07_e04_c04_u074	I can't tell you. It's a secret.
s07_e04_c04_u075	Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
s07_e04_c04_u076	Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.
s07_e04_c04_u077	No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
s07_e04_c04_u078	Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
s07_e04_c04_u079	Oh no-no, I can't do that.
s07_e04_c04_u080	If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
s07_e04_c04_u081	Okay.
s07_e04_c04_u082	Okay.
s07_e04_c04_u083	So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
s07_e04_c04_u084	Oh my God. He threw up?
s07_e04_c04_u085	No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebe's secret?
s07_e04_c04_u086	Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.
s07_e04_c04_u087	That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
s07_e04_c04_u088	That's right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.
s07_e04_c05_u089	Chandler, you have an assistant right?
s07_e04_c05_u090	(angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
s07_e04_c05_u091	No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy
s07_e04_c05_u092	What about him?
s07_e04_c05_u093	I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
s07_e04_c05_u094	Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.
s07_e04_c05_u095	Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!
s07_e04_c05_u096	Let's see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh- But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)
s07_e04_c05_u097	Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
s07_e04_c05_u098	Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
s07_e04_c06_u099	Hey-hey-hey Joey!
s07_e04_c06_u100	Hey Terry!
s07_e04_c06_u101	Good to see you again!
s07_e04_c06_u102	It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
s07_e04_c06_u103	It's a different building.
s07_e04_c06_u104	So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
s07_e04_c06_u105	Why don't we start right now!
s07_e04_c06_u106	Okay.
s07_e04_c06_u107	Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.)
s07_e04_c06_u108	(looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
s07_e04_c06_u109	Why would you think that?
s07_e04_c06_u110	Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
s07_e04_c06_u111	Everybody has to audition.
s07_e04_c06_u112	Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.
s07_e04_c06_u113	I'm sorry Joey that's-that's the way it is.
s07_e04_c06_u114	Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who's hoop- This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
s07_e04_c07_u115	Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
s07_e04_c07_u116	I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first- (Notices her plant) There is a plant in your office.
s07_e04_c07_u117	Kinda.
s07_e04_c07_u118	Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume. (Sets the plant down on her desk.)
s07_e04_c07_u119	Oh-ohh, thank you.
s07_e04_c07_u120	Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.
s07_e04_c07_u121	Well
s07_e04_c07_u122	Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.)
s07_e04_c07_u123	But I hired you!
s07_e04_c07_u124	What?
s07_e04_c07_u125	Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
s07_e04_c07_u126	I am?!
s07_e04_c07_u127	Yeah!
s07_e04_c07_u128	I can't believe it!
s07_e04_c07_u129	Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
s07_e04_c08_u130	Hey.
s07_e04_c08_u131	Hey! Good, you're home!
s07_e04_c08_u132	Oh it's always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"
s07_e04_c08_u133	Hey baby. (Kisses him.)
s07_e04_c08_u134	Hey.
s07_e04_c08_u135	I made you a surprise.
s07_e04_c08_u136	Oh yeah?
s07_e04_c08_u137	Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.
s07_e04_c08_u138	Did you not understand the story?
s07_e04_c08_u139	(entering) Hey!
s07_e04_c08_u140	Hey! What's up?
s07_e04_c08_u141	Ross!
s07_e04_c08_u142	Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
s07_e04_c08_u143	Huh.
s07_e04_c08_u144	(notices the table) Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
s07_e04_c08_u145	No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
s07_e04_c08_u146	What you got over there? Tacos?
s07_e04_c08_u147	No! No. They're umm- They're just uh-ground beef smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)
s07_e04_c08_u148	Uhh, those are tacos.
s07_e04_c08_u149	Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
s07_e04_c08_u150	Eh, either way I'll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can't eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) What's so funny?!
s07_e04_c08_u151	(trying not to laugh) I'm not laughing.
s07_e04_c08_u152	(To Chandler) You told her!
s07_e04_c08_u153	Nancy Thompson's getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
s07_e04_c08_u154	(To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
s07_e04_c08_u155	You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler laughing.)
s07_e04_c08_u156	(To Chandler) How could you tell her?!
s07_e04_c08_u157	I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
s07_e04_c08_u158	Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
s07_e04_c08_u159	Du-ude!
s07_e04_c08_u160	(running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!
s07_e04_c08_u161	Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
s07_e04_c08_u162	Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
s07_e04_c08_u163	And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with-girls.
s07_e04_c08_u164	(To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
s07_e04_c08_u165	In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
s07_e04_c08_u166	Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
s07_e04_c08_u167	Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
s07_e04_c08_u168	Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
s07_e04_c09_u169	Hi!
s07_e04_c09_u170	Hey.
s07_e04_c09_u171	Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
s07_e04_c09_u172	Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.
s07_e04_c09_u173	Was she happy you gave her the job?
s07_e04_c09_u174	Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
s07_e04_c09_u175	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To Phoebe and Rachel) It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like they're taking it off the air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
s07_e04_c09_u176	Sorry.
s07_e04_c09_u177	I'm sorry Joey.
s07_e04_c09_u178	Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
s07_e04_c10_u179	You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
s07_e04_c10_u180	All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
s07_e04_c10_u181	Ross came in forth and cried!
s07_e04_c10_u182	Oh my God! (Laughing)
s07_e04_c10_u183	Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
s07_e04_c10_u184	I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!
s07_e04_c10_u185	Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
s07_e04_c10_u186	Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
s07_e04_c10_u187	Monica couldn't tell time til she was 13!
s07_e04_c10_u188	It's hard for some people!
s07_e04_c10_u189	(To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow-whoa!
s07_e04_c10_u190	Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
s07_e04_c10_u191	Hey!!!
s07_e04_c10_u192	Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!
s07_e04_c10_u193	Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
s07_e04_c10_u194	That was you!
s07_e04_c10_u195	Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
s07_e04_c11_u196	How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!
s07_e04_c11_u197	Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
s07_e04_c11_u198	Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
s07_e04_c11_u199	What happened?
s07_e04_c11_u200	Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
s07_e04_c11_u201	Joey, why would you do that?
s07_e04_c11_u202	Because they wanted me to audition!
s07_e04_c11_u203	You! An actor?! That's madness!
s07_e04_c12_u204	Rachel Green's office. (Hangs up.)
s07_e04_c12_u205	Tag? (He turns and looks at her.) Hi, who was that?
s07_e04_c12_u206	(shyly) Nobody. I was just practicing.
s07_e04_c12_u207	Really? (Giggles.)
s07_e04_c12_u208	Hi!
s07_e04_c12_u209	Hi! Rachel Green's office.
s07_e04_c12_u210	You must be Hilda.
s07_e04_c12_u211	Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second? (Goes into office.)
s07_e04_c12_u212	Phoebe! That's a great name.
s07_e04_c12_u213	Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
s07_e04_c12_u214	(grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We'll be right back. (They go into her office and she closes the door.)
s07_e04_c12_u215	So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
s07_e04_c12_u216	All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you
s07_e04_c12_u217	But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
s07_e04_c12_u218	Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There's a knock on the door.) Yes?
s07_e04_c12_u219	Hey Rachel!
s07_e04_c12_u220	Hi!
s07_e04_c12_u221	Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he
s07_e04_c12_u222	Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.)
s07_e04_c13_u223	Hey! Terry.
s07_e04_c13_u224	Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! (Gets up) I gotta go Joey.
s07_e04_c13_u225	Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I- Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
s07_e04_c13_u226	I can't help you Joey.
s07_e04_c13_u227	Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.
s07_e04_c13_u228	This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
s07_e04_c13_u229	It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
s07_e04_c13_u230	Good morning. (He walks over to the bed, leans down, and whispers to him.) Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?
s07_e04_c13_u231	(jumping up and removing the bandages) I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
s07_e04_c14_u232	Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
s07_e04_c14_u233	And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
s07_e04_c14_u234	(To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
s07_e04_c14_u235	No!
s07_e04_c14_u236	Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
s07_e04_c14_u237	I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)
s07_e04_c14_u238	Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
s07_e04_c14_u239	Yeah?
s07_e04_c14_u240	Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
s07_e04_c14_u241	Ohh, absolutely.
s07_e04_c14_u242	And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
s07_e04_c14_u243	Yeah, definitely!
s07_e04_c14_u244	Okay, (gets up) if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.
s07_e04_c14_u245	Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
s07_e04_c14_u246	Man! (Monica mouths, "I'm sorry.")
s07_e04_c14_u247	Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with-all the guys in my office.
s07_e04_c15_u248	(noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)
s07_e04_c15_u249	Do you have a minute?
s07_e04_c15_u250	Well yeah, sure, what's up?
s07_e04_c15_u251	I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch-by guys.
s07_e04_c15_u252	Oh really?!
s07_e04_c15_u253	Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
s07_e04_c15_u254	Oh, did you not want people to know that?
s07_e04_c15_u255	But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
s07_e04_c15_u256	Why's that?
s07_e04_c15_u257	I don't think I should say.
s07_e04_c15_u258	Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)
s07_e04_c15_u259	Okay.
s07_e04_c15_u260	Kay.
s07_e04_c15_u261	Well
s07_e04_c15_u262	Yeah.
s07_e04_c15_u263	I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
s07_e04_c15_u264	(Pause) Yeah, she's gay.
s01_e15_c01_u001	Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?
s01_e15_c01_u002	Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I'm sorry!
s01_e15_c02_u003	Chandler.
s01_e15_c02_u004	Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
s01_e15_c02_u005	Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
s01_e15_c02_u006	Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.
s01_e15_c03_u007	Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
s01_e15_c03_u008	Hey!
s01_e15_c03_u009	Hey!
s01_e15_c03_u010	Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
s01_e15_c03_u011	What's going on?
s01_e15_c03_u012	What is it?
s01_e15_c03_u013	So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
s01_e15_c03_u014	That's great!
s01_e15_c03_u015	So.... I quit.
s01_e15_c03_u016	Why?
s01_e15_c03_u017	Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
s01_e15_c03_u018	Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
s01_e15_c03_u019	If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
s01_e15_c03_u020	So was it a lot more money?
s01_e15_c03_u021	It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
s01_e15_c03_u022	... the WENUS?
s01_e15_c03_u023	Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
s01_e15_c03_u024	(sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.
s01_e15_c03_u025	So what're you going to do?
s01_e15_c03_u026	I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
s01_e15_c03_u027	Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
s01_e15_c03_u028	(taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
s01_e15_c03_u029	Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
s01_e15_c03_u030	Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
s01_e15_c03_u031	(to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!
s01_e15_c03_u032	Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
s01_e15_c03_u033	(excited) Oh my God!
s01_e15_c03_u034	Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?
s01_e15_c03_u035	Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
s01_e15_c03_u036	OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!
s01_e15_c04_u037	Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
s01_e15_c04_u038	No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
s01_e15_c04_u039	Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
s01_e15_c04_u040	Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the "a-gogo."
s01_e15_c04_u041	Career counselor?
s01_e15_c04_u042	Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
s01_e15_c04_u043	I don't!
s01_e15_c04_u044	Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
s01_e15_c04_u045	Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
s01_e15_c04_u046	Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
s01_e15_c04_u047	Ooh! Brian's Song!
s01_e15_c04_u048	The meeting with the guy went great?
s01_e15_c04_u049	So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
s01_e15_c04_u050	Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
s01_e15_c04_u051	So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
s01_e15_c04_u052	What are you going to make?
s01_e15_c04_u053	(as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.
s01_e15_c04_u054	(pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?
s01_e15_c04_u055	I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
s01_e15_c04_u056	Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. (sits down)
s01_e15_c04_u057	Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
s01_e15_c04_u058	How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
s01_e15_c04_u059	OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
s01_e15_c04_u060	Who are you going out with?
s01_e15_c04_u061	Oh, is this the bug lady?
s01_e15_c04_u062	(trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
s01_e15_c04_u063	Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
s01_e15_c04_u064	So what are you guys going to do?
s01_e15_c04_u065	Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
s01_e15_c04_u066	And he's not speaking metaphorically.
s01_e15_c04_u067	(aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?
s01_e15_c04_u068	Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures) huh-huh.
s01_e15_c04_u069	I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
s01_e15_c05_u070	Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
s01_e15_c05_u071	I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
s01_e15_c05_u072	Alright... (lifts Marcel away)
s01_e15_c06_u073	(to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.
s01_e15_c06_u074	(tasting) Mmmm. Good.
s01_e15_c06_u075	Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
s01_e15_c06_u076	It's creamier.
s01_e15_c06_u077	Yeah, well, is that better?
s01_e15_c06_u078	I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
s01_e15_c06_u079	My God! What happened to you?
s01_e15_c06_u080	Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
s01_e15_c06_u081	That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
s01_e15_c06_u082	Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
s01_e15_c06_u083	(comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
s01_e15_c06_u084	(brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
s01_e15_c06_u085	Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
s01_e15_c06_u086	It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
s01_e15_c06_u087	(tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
s01_e15_c06_u088	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)
s01_e15_c06_u089	Ten dollars an hour for what?
s01_e15_c06_u090	Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
s01_e15_c06_u091	(hurt) Waitressing?
s01_e15_c06_u092	Uh-oh.
s01_e15_c06_u093	Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
s01_e15_c06_u094	But, but?
s01_e15_c06_u095	But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
s01_e15_c06_u096	Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
s01_e15_c06_u097	You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
s01_e15_c07_u098	Talk to me.
s01_e15_c07_u099	OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
s01_e15_c07_u100	No no no. Talk... dirty.
s01_e15_c07_u101	(embarrassed) Wha... what, here?
s01_e15_c07_u102	Yes...
s01_e15_c07_u103	Ah....
s01_e15_c07_u104	Say something..... hot.
s01_e15_c07_u105	(panicked) Er.... um.....
s01_e15_c07_u106	What?
s01_e15_c07_u107	Um... uh.... vulva.
s01_e15_c08_u108	(in disbelief) Vulva?
s01_e15_c08_u109	Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
s01_e15_c08_u110	(sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
s01_e15_c08_u111	Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
s01_e15_c08_u112	What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
s01_e15_c08_u113	(deadpan) Please be kidding.
s01_e15_c08_u114	Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
s01_e15_c08_u115	OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...
s01_e15_c08_u116	....yeah... what else?
s01_e15_c08_u117	That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. (gets up, walks across room)
s01_e15_c08_u118	(walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
s01_e15_c08_u119	Joey, please.
s01_e15_c08_u120	Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
s01_e15_c08_u121	(impressed) Wow.
s01_e15_c08_u122	Alright, now you say something.
s01_e15_c08_u123	I... ahem... I really don't think so.
s01_e15_c08_u124	Come on! You like this woman, right?
s01_e15_c08_u125	Yeah.
s01_e15_c08_u126	You want to see her again, right?
s01_e15_c08_u127	Sure.
s01_e15_c08_u128	Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
s01_e15_c08_u129	OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
s01_e15_c08_u130	(turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
s01_e15_c08_u131	Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
s01_e15_c08_u132	There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
s01_e15_c08_u133	I, er...
s01_e15_c08_u134	I want to take my tongue... and...
s01_e15_c08_u135	....and....
s01_e15_c08_u136	Say it... say it!
s01_e15_c08_u137	...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
s01_e15_c08_u138	(smiling)....with??
s01_e15_c08_u139	(rushing to explain) Funny story!
s01_e15_c08_u140	It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
s01_e15_c08_u141	Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
s01_e15_c08_u142	Again?
s01_e15_c08_u143	And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again.
s01_e15_c08_u144	(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)
s01_e15_c09_u145	Well?
s01_e15_c09_u146	(excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
s01_e15_c09_u147	Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
s01_e15_c09_u148	Oh! You have a window!
s01_e15_c09_u149	Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
s01_e15_c09_u150	Oh look! That guy's peeing!
s01_e15_c09_u151	(walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
s01_e15_c09_u152	(sitting) OK.
s01_e15_c09_u153	This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
s01_e15_c09_u154	Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
s01_e15_c09_u155	Last time I do that, I promise.
s01_e15_c10_u156	(shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)
s01_e15_c10_u157	Who was that?
s01_e15_c10_u158	Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
s01_e15_c10_u159	Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)
s01_e15_c10_u160	Ten dollars an hour.
s01_e15_c10_u161	No.
s01_e15_c10_u162	Twelve dollars an hour.
s01_e15_c10_u163	Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
s01_e15_c10_u164	You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour.
s01_e15_c10_u165	Done.
s01_e15_c11_u166	Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
s01_e15_c11_u167	Hi Steve!
s01_e15_c11_u168	Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl.
s01_e15_c11_u169	(to Steve) This is Rachel.
s01_e15_c11_u170	(unconcerned) Yeah, OK.
s01_e15_c11_u171	(overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop) of, OK, smells.
s01_e15_c11_u172	It's a lovely apartment.
s01_e15_c11_u173	Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
s01_e15_c11_u174	I was just being polite, but, alright.
s01_e15_c11_u175	What's up?
s01_e15_c11_u176	(whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
s01_e15_c11_u177	What?
s01_e15_c11_u178	Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
s01_e15_c11_u179	OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
s01_e15_c11_u180	(from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)
s01_e15_c11_u181	Let me, let me get you some wine!
s01_e15_c11_u182	Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger.
s01_e15_c11_u183	Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
s01_e15_c11_u184	I'm so glad you liked them!
s01_e15_c11_u185	Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
s01_e15_c11_u186	Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
s01_e15_c11_u187	Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets up and goes into the kitchen)
s01_e15_c11_u188	Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
s01_e15_c11_u189	You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
s01_e15_c11_u190	(from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "You see!") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
s01_e15_c11_u191	(joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
s01_e15_c11_u192	(looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)
s01_e15_c11_u193	You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
s01_e15_c11_u194	Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
s01_e15_c11_u195	No, we don't. (reaches for box)
s01_e15_c11_u196	Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends down to pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.)
s01_e15_c11_u197	Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
s01_e15_c11_u198	(childishly) No.
s01_e15_c11_u199	Give them to me.
s01_e15_c11_u200	Alright, we'll share.
s01_e15_c11_u201	No, give me the...
s01_e15_c11_u202	Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaks open. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
s01_e15_c11_u203	(furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
s01_e15_c11_u204	What?
s01_e15_c11_u205	What?
s01_e15_c11_u206	Why?
s01_e15_c11_u207	Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
s01_e15_c11_u208	(excited) Hey!
s01_e15_c12_u209	What a tool!
s01_e15_c12_u210	You don't want to work for a guy like that.
s01_e15_c12_u211	I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
s01_e15_c12_u212	Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
s01_e15_c12_u213	Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
s01_e15_c12_u214	(to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?
s01_e15_c12_u215	Oh, I was unbelievable.
s01_e15_c12_u216	All right, Ross!
s01_e15_c12_u217	I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
s01_e15_c12_u218	Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
s01_e15_c12_u219	Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
s01_e15_c12_u220	You cuddled.
s01_e15_c12_u221	Yeah, which was nice.
s01_e15_c12_u222	You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
s01_e15_c12_u223	Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
s01_e15_c12_u224	Yeah, where the hell is he?
s01_e15_c13_u225	(on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....
s01_e15_c14_u226	How's this? (presses down hard)
s01_e15_c14_u227	Eeeee!
s01_e15_c14_u228	Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)
s01_e15_c14_u229	Aaaaah!
s01_e15_c14_u230	See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses down elsewhere)
s01_e15_c14_u231	No.
s01_e15_c14_u232	What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain)
s06_e24_c01_u001	God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
s06_e24_c01_u002	Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of em.
s06_e24_c01_u003	Yeah, you didn't get one.
s06_e24_c01_u004	Okay, well tonight's the big night.
s06_e24_c01_u005	Yeah!
s06_e24_c01_u006	Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
s06_e24_c01_u007	It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
s06_e24_c01_u008	Ohh
s06_e24_c01_u009	That sounds perfect!
s06_e24_c01_u010	Yeah.
s06_e24_c01_u011	You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
s06_e24_c01_u012	I'm not gonna mess it up.
s06_e24_c01_u013	If she says no, can I have the ring?
s06_e24_c01_u014	She's not gonna say no.
s06_e24_c01_u015	If!
s06_e24_c01_u016	(entering) Hey!
s06_e24_c01_u017	Hey!
s06_e24_c01_u018	Hey!
s06_e24_c01_u019	(with her mouthful) Hi Monica.
s06_e24_c01_u020	(To Phoebe) Give me it!
s06_e24_c01_u021	It's gone.
s06_e24_c01_u022	Phoebe!
s06_e24_c01_u023	Hey!
s06_e24_c01_u024	(with his mouthful) Hi Monica.
s06_e24_c01_u025	(To Chandler) We're practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and winks at him.)
s06_e24_c02_u026	(entering) Hey!
s06_e24_c02_u027	Hey!
s06_e24_c02_u028	Hey Rach!
s06_e24_c02_u029	Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?
s06_e24_c02_u030	(glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
s06_e24_c02_u031	Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
s06_e24_c02_u032	What's the big deal?
s06_e24_c02_u033	I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
s06_e24_c02_u034	Where are you going?
s06_e24_c02_u035	How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.)
s06_e24_c02_u036	Open bar?
s06_e24_c02_u037	I think so.
s06_e24_c02_u038	I can do that for the kids.
s06_e24_c02_u039	Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
s06_e24_c02_u040	Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
s06_e24_c02_u041	Okay. Have a benefit.
s06_e24_c02_u042	(entering) Hey!
s06_e24_c02_u043	Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
s06_e24_c02_u044	Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
s06_e24_c02_u045	Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
s06_e24_c02_u046	I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
s06_e24_c02_u047	Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
s06_e24_c02_u048	Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
s06_e24_c02_u049	Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
s06_e24_c02_u050	I don't know.
s06_e24_c02_u051	Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
s06_e24_c02_u052	Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
s06_e24_c02_u053	Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
s06_e24_c02_u054	Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
s06_e24_c02_u055	That's not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)
s06_e24_c02_u056	See? Now, he could date her.
s06_e24_c03_u057	Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in all excited.) What's going on little elves?
s06_e24_c03_u058	It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
s06_e24_c03_u059	Yeah, yeah you have the ring?
s06_e24_c03_u060	Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?
s06_e24_c03_u061	Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)
s06_e24_c03_u062	Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.
s06_e24_c03_u063	(to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
s06_e24_c03_u064	Hi guys.
s06_e24_c03_u065	(To Monica) You are beautiful.
s06_e24_c03_u066	Oh, thank you! (The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears knowing glances.) (Monica giggles.) What's going on?
s06_e24_c03_u067	(breaking up) We're just really-very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
s06_e24_c04_u068	Here.
s06_e24_c04_u069	Oh! Thank you!
s06_e24_c04_u070	So now what's going on here?
s06_e24_c04_u071	Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
s06_e24_c04_u072	No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?
s06_e24_c04_u073	(suddenly worried) Uh, wh-why?
s06_e24_c04_u074	No! It's nice!
s06_e24_c04_u075	Nice to see you Rachel.
s06_e24_c04_u076	Oh, hi!
s06_e24_c04_u077	So glad you brought someone.
s06_e24_c04_u078	Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) He's the head of my department.
s06_e24_c04_u079	Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)
s06_e24_c04_u080	And I also brought my friend Joey
s06_e24_c04_u081	(behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his way for the shrimp toast.)
s06_e24_c04_u082	Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.
s06_e24_c04_u083	Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.
s06_e24_c04_u084	Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.
s06_e24_c04_u085	Ohh, nice choice.
s06_e24_c04_u086	Yeah.
s06_e24_c04_u087	Good luck.
s06_e24_c04_u088	Thank you. (Mr. Thompson walks away and after he's left.) Okay, (writing her bid down) twenty dollars.
s06_e24_c05_u089	Shut the door! Shut the door!! (Runs over and closes the door.)
s06_e24_c05_u090	What's-what's going on?
s06_e24_c05_u091	The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
s06_e24_c05_u092	Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!
s06_e24_c05_u093	No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!
s06_e24_c05_u094	Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same
s06_e24_c05_u095	(ignoring him and picking up a pitcher) Who drank all the Kamikazes?
s06_e24_c05_u096	(approaching with two filled balloons in her hands) Nobody! We put them in here! (Indicates the aforementioned balloons causing both of them to scream in delight and start drinking from the balloons.)
s06_e24_c05_u097	(To Ross) You want some?! (Starts to squirt the Kamikaze at him.)
s06_e24_c05_u098	No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
s06_e24_c05_u099	Yeah, sure.
s06_e24_c05_u100	Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh
s06_e24_c05_u101	Attack!
s06_e24_c05_u102	Put your balloons down!
s06_e24_c05_u103	You put your balloons down!!
s06_e24_c05_u104	(screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)
s06_e24_c06_u105	Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris. (Pause.) It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.
s06_e24_c06_u106	Ugh! So close!
s06_e24_c06_u107	Hey you guys! Look!
s06_e24_c06_u108	Hey!
s06_e24_c06_u109	I got me some drinks!
s06_e24_c06_u110	What are you doing?
s06_e24_c06_u111	Open bar!
s06_e24_c06_u112	Well now it's an empty bar.
s06_e24_c06_u113	You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
s06_e24_c06_u114	And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000! (Joey suddenly gets excited.)
s06_e24_c06_u115	I won! That was my guess!
s06_e24_c06_u116	What?! What?! What?!
s06_e24_c06_u117	I guessed 20,000!
s06_e24_c06_u118	Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!
s06_e24_c06_u119	What?! I don't have 20,000!
s06_e24_c06_u120	Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!
s06_e24_c06_u121	Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)
s06_e24_c06_u122	Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.]
s06_e24_c07_u123	What are you doing?
s06_e24_c07_u124	(trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It's a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)
s06_e24_c07_u125	Are you okay?
s06_e24_c07_u126	Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
s06_e24_c07_u127	Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
s06_e24_c07_u128	Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
s06_e24_c07_u129	(laughs) Are you sure you're okay?
s06_e24_c07_u130	Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
s06_e24_c07_u131	Ohh that's sweet!
s06_e24_c07_u132	Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with
s06_e24_c07_u133	(interrupting him) Oh my God!
s06_e24_c07_u134	(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.
s06_e24_c07_u135	Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richard's back.)
s06_e24_c07_u136	What?! I'm Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks) Oh, that's Richard!
s06_e24_c07_u137	Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
s06_e24_c07_u138	(approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!
s06_e24_c07_u139	Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don't know why I did that!
s06_e24_c07_u140	Hey, it's good to see you!
s06_e24_c07_u141	You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
s06_e24_c07_u142	Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
s06_e24_c07_u143	Well, my nose got lonely.
s06_e24_c07_u144	(to Richard's date) And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.) I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
s06_e24_c07_u145	Hi.
s06_e24_c07_u146	Oh, I'm sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa, (nodding at each) Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
s06_e24_c07_u147	Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, did it again.
s06_e24_c07_u148	Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
s06_e24_c07_u149	Yeah, I'll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)
s06_e24_c07_u150	(to Richard) It's good to see you
s06_e24_c07_u151	(to Richard) You're table's ready sir.
s06_e24_c07_u152	Oh. Good to see you guys.
s06_e24_c07_u153	Yes. (Thinking he's gone.)
s06_e24_c07_u154	(motioning to the empty table next to Monica and Chandler's) Or if you prefer, this table is available.
s06_e24_c07_u155	That might be fun. (Richard and Lisa sit down.)
s06_e24_c08_u156	What were you thinking?!
s06_e24_c08_u157	I didn't know it was an auction!
s06_e24_c08_u158	Wh?!
s06_e24_c08_u159	I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
s06_e24_c08_u160	Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
s06_e24_c08_u161	I don't know! Charity?
s06_e24_c08_u162	Ugh!
s06_e24_c08_u163	Well, just buy the damn boat! (She's still working her way through her tray of booze.)
s06_e24_c08_u164	Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
s06_e24_c08_u165	I'm just helping the kids!
s06_e24_c08_u166	How is you drinking helping the kids?
s06_e24_c08_u167	Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
s06_e24_c08_u168	(approaching) Mr. Tribbiani.
s06_e24_c08_u169	Oh hi!
s06_e24_c08_u170	Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
s06_e24_c08_u171	Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
s06_e24_c08_u172	I think it was valued at 19,000
s06_e24_c08_u173	(To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
s06_e24_c08_u174	Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)
s06_e24_c08_u175	That's good. Very good! (Walks away.)
s06_e24_c08_u176	So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)
s06_e24_c08_u177	(stopping him) Hey! You-can't-leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
s06_e24_c08_u178	Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
s06_e24_c08_u179	I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
s06_e24_c08_u180	Okay.
s06_e24_c08_u181	Okay.
s06_e24_c08_u182	Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
s06_e24_c08_u183	Not great.
s06_e24_c09_u184	And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
s06_e24_c09_u185	And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
s06_e24_c09_u186	So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
s06_e24_c09_u187	(laughing) Oh my God!
s06_e24_c09_u188	I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
s06_e24_c09_u189	It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
s06_e24_c09_u190	Ohh.
s06_e24_c09_u191	What?!
s06_e24_c10_u192	Oh my God, you guys!! (He's excited about what he thought happened.)
s06_e24_c10_u193	(stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
s06_e24_c10_u194	Who?
s06_e24_c10_u195	Richard!
s06_e24_c10_u196	What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
s06_e24_c10_u197	Oh you knew that. Good!
s06_e24_c10_u198	I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
s06_e24_c10_u199	Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
s06_e24_c10_u200	Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
s06_e24_c10_u201	Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
s06_e24_c10_u202	Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.
s06_e24_c10_u203	Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
s06_e24_c10_u204	If the school finds out you're fired.
s06_e24_c10_u205	Hmm.
s06_e24_c10_u206	She's leaving for three months.
s06_e24_c10_u207	For camp!
s06_e24_c10_u208	Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and
s06_e24_c10_u209	Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
s06_e24_c10_u210	No! No! I-didn't do that. It's just- Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
s06_e24_c10_u211	Okay well I think-that's your answer.
s06_e24_c10_u212	I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
s06_e24_c10_u213	Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
s06_e24_c11_u214	Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
s06_e24_c11_u215	Oh great!
s06_e24_c11_u216	(To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
s06_e24_c11_u217	Oh, okay.
s06_e24_c11_u218	(To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
s06_e24_c11_u219	It's a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she's wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.) Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
s06_e24_c11_u220	Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.)
s06_e24_c11_u221	Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
s06_e24_c11_u222	That's me.
s06_e24_c11_u223	Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the talking.)
s06_e24_c11_u224	Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
s06_e24_c11_u225	You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
s06_e24_c11_u226	(To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)
s06_e24_c11_u227	I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
s06_e24_c11_u228	Ohh
s06_e24_c11_u229	Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
s06_e24_c11_u230	Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
s06_e24_c11_u231	It's Pam.
s06_e24_c11_u232	Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
s06_e24_c11_u233	Aw-awww!
s06_e24_c11_u234	I don't think she'd like that.
s06_e24_c11_u235	Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
s06_e24_c11_u236	Oooooh
s06_e24_c11_u237	I don't think so dear.
s06_e24_c11_u238	Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to him.) All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h-(sees that he's bald)-arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
s06_e24_c11_u239	What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
s06_e24_c11_u240	No way! It's mine!!
s06_e24_c11_u241	(To Joey) What?! What?!
s06_e24_c11_u242	All that stuff you just said? I want that!
s06_e24_c11_u243	But Joey you don't have $20,000!
s06_e24_c11_u244	Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
s06_e24_c12_u245	Oh my God, you're back!
s06_e24_c12_u246	Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)
s06_e24_c12_u247	Why do you want to see my hand?
s06_e24_c12_u248	I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
s06_e24_c12_u249	Yeah.
s06_e24_c12_u250	Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
s06_e24_c12_u251	(suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe's wishes.)
s06_e24_c12_u252	(after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
s06_e24_c12_u253	What happened?
s06_e24_c12_u254	Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
s06_e24_c12_u255	What?! Noooo- (Phoebe gasps.)
s06_e24_c12_u256	I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
s06_e24_c12_u257	We didn't ruin it!
s06_e24_c12_u258	Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
s06_e24_c12_u259	Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor
s06_e24_c12_u260	Glove salesman!
s06_e24_c12_u261	Good one! Yeah.
s06_e24_c12_u262	This is terrible. What am I going to do?
s06_e24_c12_u263	Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
s06_e24_c12_u264	That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
s06_e24_c12_u265	Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
s06_e24_c12_u266	I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
s06_e24_c12_u267	Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)
s06_e24_c12_u268	(entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
s06_e24_c12_u269	That guy's still doing that?!
s06_e24_c12_u270	(entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
s06_e24_c12_u271	No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
s06_e24_c13_u272	(in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
s06_e24_c13_u273	(sticking her head out her window) Ross! Wait!
s06_e24_c13_u274	Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
s06_e24_c13_u275	You suck!!
s06_e24_c13_u276	What?!
s06_e24_c13_u277	Okay, break-up's still on!
s06_e24_c14_u278	Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
s06_e24_c14_u279	Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each other.) I never noticed that before.
s06_e24_c14_u280	(entering) Hi guys!
s06_e24_c14_u281	Hey!
s06_e24_c14_u282	Hey!
s06_e24_c14_u283	What are you up too?
s06_e24_c14_u284	Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
s06_e24_c14_u285	(laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.
s06_e24_c14_u286	Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
s06_e24_c14_u287	Yeah, well- Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
s06_e24_c14_u288	Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
s06_e24_c14_u289	Eh
s06_e24_c14_u290	Okay well that's good to know.
s06_e24_c14_u291	(all excited) The Mr. Bowmont's here!!! (Jumps over the back off the couch and runs out into the street.)
s06_e24_c15_u292	Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
s06_e24_c15_u293	Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)
s06_e24_c15_u294	(to the customer) Come on in.
s06_e24_c15_u295	Hi!
s06_e24_c15_u296	Richard!
s06_e24_c15_u297	Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
s06_e24_c15_u298	Ohh- Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
s06_e24_c15_u299	Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
s06_e24_c15_u300	Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
s06_e24_c15_u301	No! I came here to tell you something else. (Pause) I came here (Pause) to tell you I still love you.
s06_e24_c16_u302	What uh-What did you-What?!
s06_e24_c16_u303	I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
s06_e24_c16_u304	Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
s06_e24_c16_u305	Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
s06_e24_c16_u306	Oh God- (Starts looking around.) Why don't they put chairs back here?!
s06_e24_c16_u307	I know this is crazy but am I too late?
s06_e24_c16_u308	What the- Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
s06_e24_c16_u309	Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
s06_e24_c16_u310	What were you doing in Africa?
s06_e24_c16_u311	Working with blind kids.
s06_e24_c16_u312	Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I- I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
s06_e24_c16_u313	Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
s06_e24_c16_u314	Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
s06_e24_c16_u315	You are?
s06_e24_c16_u316	Yeah!
s06_e24_c16_u317	Why?
s06_e24_c16_u318	Why? Because of the government.
s06_e24_c17_u319	Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
s06_e24_c17_u320	I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
s06_e24_c17_u321	Ohh- I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
s06_e24_c17_u322	Not that often!
s06_e24_c17_u323	No! I'm so happy for them!
s06_e24_c17_u324	Me too! So happy for them!
s06_e24_c17_u325	I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
s06_e24_c17_u326	Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
s06_e24_c17_u327	I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
s06_e24_c17_u328	Totally. I'm like 90/10.
s06_e24_c17_u329	Yeah me too.
s06_e24_c17_u330	Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
s06_e24_c17_u331	(staring at him) Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
s06_e24_c18_u332	So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
s06_e24_c18_u333	Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
s06_e24_c18_u334	Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
s06_e24_c18_u335	If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
s06_e24_c18_u336	Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
s06_e24_c18_u337	Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
s06_e24_c18_u338	Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
s06_e24_c18_u339	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of The Rules' huh mantrap?!
s06_e24_c18_u340	Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
s06_e24_c18_u341	(to them) It's okay, I got a plan.
s06_e24_c19_u342	We're gonna find love!
s06_e24_c19_u343	Definitely!
s06_e24_c19_u344	Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
s06_e24_c19_u345	What do you mean?
s06_e24_c19_u346	Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
s06_e24_c19_u347	You mean a backup?
s06_e24_c19_u348	Exactly!
s06_e24_c19_u349	Yeah, yeah I got that.
s06_e24_c19_u350	You do?
s06_e24_c19_u351	Hm-mmm.
s06_e24_c19_u352	Who?
s06_e24_c19_u353	Joey.
s06_e24_c19_u354	Joey?!
s06_e24_c19_u355	Yeah!
s06_e24_c19_u356	Are you serious?!
s06_e24_c19_u357	Yeah, I locked him years ago!
s06_e24_c19_u358	Wh- So- If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
s06_e24_c19_u359	Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
s06_e24_c19_u360	Oh, seriously?
s06_e24_c19_u361	Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were- (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
s06_e24_c19_u362	Charming.
s06_e24_c19_u363	Well hey, it's just a backup.
s06_e24_c19_u364	Yeah.
s06_e24_c20_u365	Hey Monica!
s06_e24_c20_u366	Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
s06_e24_c20_u367	This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
s06_e24_c20_u368	Yeah, it's great.
s06_e24_c20_u369	Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
s06_e24_c20_u370	I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
s06_e24_c20_u371	Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
s06_e24_c20_u372	It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
s06_e24_c20_u373	Well, you know Chandler.
s06_e24_c20_u374	No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
s06_e24_c20_u375	Maybe you changed?
s06_e24_c20_u376	I didn't change!
s06_e24_c20_u377	Maybe that's the problem.
s06_e24_c20_u378	What?!
s06_e24_c20_u379	Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
s06_e24_c20_u380	Is that some kind of boat talk?
s06_e24_c20_u381	I don't know! (All excited) I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
s06_e24_c20_u382	What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
s06_e24_c20_u383	Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
s06_e24_c20_u384	(starts for the door) Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
s06_e24_c20_u385	There are?
s06_e24_c20_u386	Yeah! Richard!
s06_e24_c20_u387	R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
s06_e24_c20_u388	That's right.
s06_e24_c20_u389	Chandler loves marriage!!
s06_e24_c20_u390	You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
s06_e24_c20_u391	You got that from what I said?!
s06_e24_c21_u392	What happened you guys?
s06_e24_c21_u393	Rach!
s06_e24_c21_u394	Hey you!
s06_e24_c21_u395	Hey, come on in.
s06_e24_c21_u396	Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
s06_e24_c21_u397	Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
s06_e24_c21_u398	Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
s06_e24_c21_u399	I guess so.
s06_e24_c21_u400	So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
s06_e24_c21_u401	Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
s06_e24_c21_u402	Exactly.
s06_e24_c21_u403	Ohh, yeah I already have one.
s06_e24_c21_u404	What? Who?
s06_e24_c21_u405	Phoebe.
s06_e24_c21_u406	Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
s06_e24_c21_u407	Ohh, I don't think so.
s06_e24_c21_u408	Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
s06_e24_c21_u409	That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
s06_e24_c22_u410	Where the hell have you been?!
s06_e24_c22_u411	I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
s06_e24_c22_u412	Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
s06_e24_c22_u413	What?!
s06_e24_c22_u414	Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
s06_e24_c22_u415	My-Oh my God!
s06_e24_c22_u416	I know! They suck!!
s06_e24_c22_u417	He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
s06_e24_c22_u418	I know!
s06_e24_c22_u419	Well what- Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!
s06_e24_c22_u420	Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
s06_e24_c22_u421	You're right.
s06_e24_c22_u422	Yeah!
s06_e24_c22_u423	Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! (Does so) I'm gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) I'm just going to propose!
s06_e24_c22_u424	Okay.
s06_e24_c22_u425	Okay great.
s06_e24_c22_u426	Dude-dude-dude!
s06_e24_c22_u427	What?!
s06_e24_c22_u428	Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
s06_e24_c23_u429	Hi.
s06_e24_c23_u430	Hi.
s06_e24_c23_u431	I don't know why I'm here.
s06_e24_c23_u432	I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
s06_e24_c23_u433	I don't know.
s06_e24_c23_u434	Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch. (Does so.)
s06_e24_c23_u435	(entering) Chandler is such an idiot!
s06_e24_c23_u436	(standing up quickly) Drink?
s06_e24_c23_u437	Yeah, I'll have a scotch
s06_e24_c23_u438	on the rocks with a twist? I remember. (Goes to make her drink.)
s06_e24_c23_u439	(moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?
s06_e24_c23_u440	Uh, no! No! That's-art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
s06_e24_c23_u441	No that's, that's okay.
s06_e24_c23_u442	So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
s06_e24_c23_u443	Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
s06_e24_c23_u444	Oh really?
s06_e24_c23_u445	Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
s06_e24_c23_u446	Who is it?
s06_e24_c23_u447	Edward Nevski?
s06_e24_c23_u448	Yeah he's no good. Do you ever (pause) think about me in a (pause) non-eye doctor way?
s06_e24_c23_u449	No.
s06_e24_c23_u450	Ahh.
s06_e24_c23_u451	But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
s06_e24_c24_u452	Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
s06_e24_c24_u453	Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
s06_e24_c24_u454	What?!
s06_e24_c24_u455	(entering) Hey!
s06_e24_c24_u456	(entering) Hey!
s06_e24_c24_u457	Phoebe! We're both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!
s06_e24_c24_u458	Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
s06_e24_c24_u459	I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
s06_e24_c24_u460	No we weren't!
s06_e24_c24_u461	I was not!
s06_e24_c24_u462	Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
s06_e24_c24_u463	Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
s06_e24_c24_u464	Pick me!!
s06_e24_c24_u465	No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
s06_e24_c24_u466	All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
s06_e24_c24_u467	This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
s06_e24_c24_u468	Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
s06_e24_c24_u469	No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
s06_e24_c24_u470	Oh God, Phoebe!
s06_e24_c24_u471	(To Rachel) I'm talking about massages.
s06_e24_c24_u472	Oh.
s06_e24_c24_u473	Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so) and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
s06_e24_c24_u474	Okay that's fair.
s06_e24_c24_u475	All right.
s06_e24_c24_u476	Good!
s06_e24_c24_u477	Pick one.
s06_e24_c24_u478	Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) Thank you.
s06_e24_c24_u479	You're welcome.
s06_e24_c24_u480	(reading) Ross!
s06_e24_c24_u481	(reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.
s06_e24_c24_u482	Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)
s06_e24_c24_u483	Yeah.
s06_e24_c25_u484	(to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
s06_e24_c25_u485	Excuse me?
s06_e24_c25_u486	Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.
s06_e24_c25_u487	Oh. (Laughs.) Whew!
s06_e24_c25_u488	I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
s06_e24_c25_u489	Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
s06_e24_c25_u490	Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
s06_e24_c25_u491	I think that's fair.
s06_e24_c25_u492	Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
s06_e24_c25_u493	It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. (Hugs her) Shhhh.
s06_e24_c25_u494	Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes.) I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm
s06_e24_c25_u495	I know. (Backs away.)
s06_e24_c25_u496	Y'know, I-I- I have to figure-some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can
s06_e24_c25_u497	Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. (Pause) Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking. (Monica leaves.)
s06_e24_c26_u498	Chandler.
s06_e24_c26_u499	Where is she? I'm not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks in.)
s06_e24_c26_u500	She's not here and please come in.
s06_e24_c26_u501	(examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
s06_e24_c26_u502	Okay, she was here, but she left.
s06_e24_c26_u503	Well where did she go?
s06_e24_c26_u504	Well she said she had to think things over.
s06_e24_c26_u505	Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought-I thought you were a good guy.
s06_e24_c26_u506	Oh, hey look nothing happened.
s06_e24_c26_u507	Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
s06_e24_c26_u508	Well all right, one thing happened?
s06_e24_c26_u509	Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
s06_e24_c26_u510	Well I'm sorry.
s06_e24_c26_u511	And what does she have to think about? I love her!
s06_e24_c26_u512	Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
s06_e24_c26_u513	But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
s06_e24_c26_u514	Well if it helps, it worked very well.
s06_e24_c26_u515	It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.
s06_e24_c26_u516	You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)
s06_e24_c26_u517	Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?
s06_e24_c26_u518	No I don't have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause) And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
s06_e24_c26_u519	Y'know Richard-you are a good guy.
s06_e24_c26_u520	I know. (Pause) I hate that!
s06_e24_c27_u521	Dude!
s06_e24_c27_u522	I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
s06_e24_c27_u523	She's gone.
s06_e24_c27_u524	What?
s06_e24_c27_u525	She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
s06_e24_c27_u526	What are you talking about?
s06_e24_c27_u527	She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
s06_e24_c27_u528	Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
s06_e24_c27_u529	I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
s06_e24_c27_u530	Well where- Where did she go?
s06_e24_c27_u531	To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
s06_e24_c27_u532	I can't believe I ruined this.
s06_e24_c27_u533	I am so sorry man.
s06_e24_c27_u534	You wanted it to be a surprise.
s06_e24_c27_u535	Oh my God.
s06_e24_c27_u536	Chandler- In all my life- I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As to-fall in love with my best-my best- There's a reason why girls don't do this!
s06_e24_c27_u537	Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought- (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
s06_e24_c27_u538	Yes.
s06_e24_c27_u539	I knew you were likely to take a wife!
s06_e24_c27_u540	(yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
s06_e24_c27_u541	Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We're engaged!!!
s06_e24_c27_u542	Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
s06_e24_c27_u543	Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
s06_e24_c27_u544	Oh
s06_e24_c27_u545	Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
s06_e24_c27_u546	Yeah!
s10_e11_c01_u001	Hey guys!
s10_e11_c01_u002	Hey, let me tell them!
s10_e11_c01_u003	Sure.
s10_e11_c01_u004	Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
s10_e11_c01_u005	Great!
s10_e11_c01_u006	Really? Which one?
s10_e11_c01_u007	(stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
s10_e11_c01_u008	Things you find in the ocean, (to Joey) You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
s10_e11_c01_u009	Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
s10_e11_c01_u010	Except for "Match game"...
s10_e11_c01_u011	Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
s10_e11_c01_u012	What did I marry into?
s10_e11_c01_u013	Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
s10_e11_c01_u014	Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
s10_e11_c01_u015	Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
s10_e11_c01_u016	Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
s10_e11_c01_u017	Seriously?
s10_e11_c01_u018	(very excited) Yeah-uh!
s10_e11_c01_u019	Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
s10_e11_c01_u020	You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
s10_e11_c01_u021	Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
s10_e11_c01_u022	Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
s10_e11_c01_u023	(singing) "I'm a little bit country"...
s10_e11_c01_u024	(singing) "...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
s10_e11_c01_u025	(to Monica) I'm leaving you.
s10_e11_c02_u026	So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
s10_e11_c02_u027	Who?
s10_e11_c02_u028	He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
s10_e11_c02_u029	(looking around) Did I go to this school?
s10_e11_c02_u030	Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
s10_e11_c02_u031	(looks over at her) Sure, nice.
s10_e11_c02_u032	Dude. You're married to my sister.
s10_e11_c02_u033	You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
s10_e11_c02_u034	Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
s10_e11_c02_u035	Are you asking permission to break the pact?
s10_e11_c02_u036	Yes please.
s10_e11_c02_u037	Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
s10_e11_c02_u038	Awesome, the name really stands out.
s10_e11_c02_u039	Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
s10_e11_c02_u040	Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
s10_e11_c02_u041	Hey guys!
s10_e11_c02_u042	Hey!
s10_e11_c02_u043	Hey, Missy...
s10_e11_c02_u044	You know, our band is playing on Friday.
s10_e11_c02_u045	Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".
s10_e11_c02_u046	No way!
s10_e11_c02_u047	Way!
s10_e11_c02_u048	Right. I'll be there. (she leaves)
s10_e11_c02_u049	Fresh!
s10_e11_c02_u050	Boss!
s10_e11_c02_u051	Mint!
s10_e11_c02_u052	She's gone.
s10_e11_c02_u053	I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
s10_e11_c02_u054	Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
s10_e11_c02_u055	I said it first, bro.
s10_e11_c02_u056	Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
s10_e11_c02_u057	(angrily) Look, if you did...
s10_e11_c02_u058	Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
s10_e11_c02_u059	Totally. I had sex in High school...
s10_e11_c02_u060	Me too. I'm good at it.
s10_e11_c02_u061	All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
s10_e11_c02_u062	You got it.
s10_e11_c02_u063	All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
s10_e11_c02_u064	Those are the pacts!
s10_e11_c02_u065	Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
s10_e11_c02_u066	Oh, oh... maybe not you!
s10_e11_c02_u067	Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
s10_e11_c02_u068	Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
s10_e11_c02_u069	Your hands are shaking.
s10_e11_c02_u070	I know, and I can't stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)
s10_e11_c03_u071	Five! Four! Three! Applause!
s10_e11_c03_u072	Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let's meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he's gonna be playing with "Days of Our Life's" star Joey Tribbiani! (Joey's amazed at the place and he keeps looking around till he realizes the audience is applauding him)
s10_e11_c03_u073	(to Gene) I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! (pause) Only better looking and richer.
s10_e11_c03_u074	...should be playing with the star of "General Hospital" Leslie Charleson. (applause) Welcome everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let's play Pyramid. All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show, Gene, you won the toss, so you're gonna start. Which category would you like?
s10_e11_c03_u075	I'll take "You crossed the line".
s10_e11_c03_u076	You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!
s10_e11_c03_u077	(on the screen there's the word "Supermarket") Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, "notebook") Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
s10_e11_c03_u078	Diary.
s10_e11_c03_u079	Noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... Damn it! (next word appears: "blueprint") Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey... (the last word is "Football field" and there are 5 seconds left) In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
s10_e11_c03_u080	Cafeteria.
s10_e11_c03_u081	Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for. (time's finished) OOOH!
s10_e11_c04_u082	(to Rachel) Thank you so much for this.
s10_e11_c04_u083	Oh, d'you like it?
s10_e11_c04_u084	Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
s10_e11_c04_u085	What?
s10_e11_c04_u086	You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
s10_e11_c04_u087	Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
s10_e11_c04_u088	Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy!
s10_e11_c04_u089	Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
s10_e11_c04_u090	Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
s10_e11_c04_u091	Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
s10_e11_c05_u092	Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.
s10_e11_c05_u093	Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
s10_e11_c05_u094	Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!
s10_e11_c05_u095	You put this in your coffee.
s10_e11_c05_u096	A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
s10_e11_c05_u097	It's white!
s10_e11_c05_u098	Paper, snow, a ghost!
s10_e11_c05_u099	It's heavier then milk!
s10_e11_c05_u100	A rock, a dog, the earth.
s10_e11_c05_u101	Pass!
s10_e11_c05_u102	You put this on a sandwich.
s10_e11_c05_u103	Salami, anchovies, jam!
s10_e11_c05_u104	It's white!
s10_e11_c05_u105	Paper, snow, a ghost!
s10_e11_c05_u106	It's made from eggs!
s10_e11_c05_u107	Chickens?
s10_e11_c05_u108	Pass!
s10_e11_c05_u109	Oh!
s10_e11_c05_u110	You put this on a hamburger!
s10_e11_c05_u111	Ketchup!
s10_e11_c05_u112	Yes!
s10_e11_c05_u113	Relish!
s10_e11_c05_u114	Stop!
s10_e11_c05_u115	Oh.
s10_e11_c05_u116	Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there...
s10_e11_c05_u117	Yeah...
s10_e11_c05_u118	Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.
s10_e11_c05_u119	And we're out!
s10_e11_c05_u120	Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
s10_e11_c05_u121	Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
s10_e11_c05_u122	Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
s10_e11_c05_u123	Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.
s10_e11_c05_u124	Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause). Yeah!
s10_e11_c06_u125	So, Saturday night!
s10_e11_c06_u126	I'd love to!
s10_e11_c06_u127	Great!
s10_e11_c06_u128	So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
s10_e11_c06_u129	Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
s10_e11_c06_u130	Sure, he was in your "band"? (she air quotes band)
s10_e11_c06_u131	It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
s10_e11_c06_u132	Sorry.
s10_e11_c06_u133	That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
s10_e11_c06_u134	Really?
s10_e11_c06_u135	Yeah, why?
s10_e11_c06_u136	Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
s10_e11_c06_u137	You did?
s10_e11_c06_u138	Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
s10_e11_c06_u139	(angrily) AND ON MY TURF?
s10_e11_c07_u140	(to Rachel) Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
s10_e11_c07_u141	Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
s10_e11_c07_u142	Who is it?
s10_e11_c07_u143	It's the police!
s10_e11_c07_u144	(pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!
s10_e11_c07_u145	(Excited, running back to her seat) Oh!
s10_e11_c07_u146	That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
s10_e11_c07_u147	What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)
s10_e11_c07_u148	(coughs) Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!
s10_e11_c07_u149	Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
s10_e11_c07_u150	Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
s10_e11_c07_u151	Goodbody!
s10_e11_c07_u152	...If-you-say-so.
s10_e11_c07_u153	So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take (he shakes his hips) downtown! (Monica points Phoebe)
s10_e11_c07_u154	Oh, God!
s10_e11_c07_u155	All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! (he thrusts his pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug in his cd player) Here? All right.
s10_e11_c07_u156	Rachel?
s10_e11_c07_u157	Yeah?
s10_e11_c07_u158	Are you kidding?
s10_e11_c07_u159	All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
s10_e11_c07_u160	How old is your phonebook?
s10_e11_c07_u161	Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
s10_e11_c07_u162	Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
s10_e11_c07_u163	Are you talking about me?
s10_e11_c07_u164	Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
s10_e11_c07_u165	Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? (pause) Did someone call for the long arm of the law? (He extends his arm from around his crotch and then upward and outward, towards Phoebe) I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! (Puts his hands over his crotch) I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
s10_e11_c07_u166	Whoa, whoa, whoa (he turn off the music). She cringed!
s10_e11_c07_u167	This is how I look when I'm turned on!
s10_e11_c07_u168	You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? (goes to get it) Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
s10_e11_c07_u169	Shocking!
s10_e11_c07_u170	Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
s10_e11_c07_u171	Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
s10_e11_c07_u172	No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
s10_e11_c07_u173	No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
s10_e11_c07_u174	Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!
s10_e11_c07_u175	I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
s10_e11_c07_u176	Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
s10_e11_c07_u177	Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)
s10_e11_c07_u178	I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin)... is all man.
s10_e11_c07_u179	I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
s10_e11_c07_u180	(making a crying face) Oh, you're mean!
s10_e11_c07_u181	(walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
s10_e11_c07_u182	Damnit. OH! (To Phoebe) Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
s10_e11_c08_u183	Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.
s10_e11_c08_u184	(To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)
s10_e11_c08_u185	Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. (Joey goes form looking very confident to looking very shocked the instant the word congress is said) Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!
s10_e11_c08_u186	Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word: "Rotunda") Pass. (Next word: "Filibuster" stares at it a moment) Pass. (Henrietta is looking very confused) (Next word: "Addendum" 4 seconds remaining) Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
s10_e11_c08_u187	Uvula!
s10_e11_c08_u188	Oh, then pass. (Next word: "Joint session", but time's up, Joey acts very disappointed)
s10_e11_c08_u189	O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! (Gene is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey) And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)
s10_e11_c09_u190	(To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
s10_e11_c09_u191	(to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!
s10_e11_c09_u192	You broke the pact!
s10_e11_c09_u193	Ross, that was 16 years ago!
s10_e11_c09_u194	That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
s10_e11_c09_u195	I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
s10_e11_c09_u196	I didn't.
s10_e11_c09_u197	Oh really?
s10_e11_c09_u198	No.
s10_e11_c09_u199	Oh really!?
s10_e11_c09_u200	NO!
s10_e11_c09_u201	ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
s10_e11_c09_u202	Yes?
s10_e11_c09_u203	Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)
s10_e11_c09_u204	I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
s10_e11_c09_u205	Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
s10_e11_c09_u206	I don't know what... you're talking about.
s10_e11_c09_u207	Really?
s10_e11_c09_u208	I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!
s10_e11_c09_u209	This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
s10_e11_c09_u210	Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
s10_e11_c09_u211	I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)
s10_e11_c09_u212	Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
s10_e11_c09_u213	It... You can so totally tell.
s10_e11_c09_u214	I KNOW!
s10_e11_c09_u215	Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).
s10_e11_c09_u216	Aren't you...?
s10_e11_c09_u217	Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).
s10_e11_c09_u218	(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?
s10_e11_c09_u219	Bitchin'
s10_e11_c09_u220	Hi Monica.
s10_e11_c09_u221	Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)
s10_e11_c09_u222	O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
s10_e11_c09_u223	Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
s10_e11_c09_u224	Oh.
s10_e11_c09_u225	Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
s10_e11_c09_u226	Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
s10_e11_c09_u227	Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
s10_e11_c09_u228	Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)
s10_e11_c10_u229	I didn't know you knew about that.
s10_e11_c10_u230	Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
s10_e11_c10_u231	(looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm sorry.
s10_e11_c10_u232	Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
s10_e11_c10_u233	So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
s10_e11_c10_u234	(smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
s10_e11_c10_u235	We are even, right?
s10_e11_c10_u236	(sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
s10_e11_c10_u237	(thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?
s10_e11_c10_u238	Not her!
s10_e11_c10_u239	I am sooo drunk.
s10_e11_c10_u240	That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)
s10_e11_c10_u241	Soo... you girls having fun?
s10_e11_c10_u242	For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)
s10_e11_c10_u243	SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
s10_e11_c10_u244	Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)
s10_e11_c10_u245	(finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
s10_e11_c10_u246	Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
s10_e11_c10_u247	(sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
s10_e11_c10_u248	Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
s10_e11_c10_u249	(blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers "Oh my God!")
s10_e11_c10_u250	So where are you applying to?
s10_e11_c10_u251	Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!
s10_e11_c10_u252	I'm in college and I'm in a band.
s10_e11_c10_u253	(She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
s10_e11_c11_u254	What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
s10_e11_c11_u255	You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
s10_e11_c11_u256	No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
s10_e11_c11_u257	No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
s10_e11_c11_u258	I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
s10_e11_c11_u259	So maybe something in an office.
s10_e11_c11_u260	Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
s10_e11_c11_u261	You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
s10_e11_c11_u262	There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
s10_e11_c11_u263	Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
s10_e11_c11_u264	(after a pause) Finish it!
s10_e11_c11_u265	What?
s10_e11_c11_u266	Your last dance. Do it for us.
s10_e11_c11_u267	Really?
s10_e11_c11_u268	(to Phoebe) Really?
s10_e11_c11_u269	Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
s10_e11_c11_u270	Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
s10_e11_c11_u271	Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
s10_e11_c11_u272	Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
s10_e11_c11_u273	(out of breath) Have to...
s10_e11_c12_u274	Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?
s10_e11_c12_u275	(nervously) Yeah...
s10_e11_c12_u276	(irritable) Sure. (Joey gets even more nervous)
s10_e11_c12_u277	Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO! (runs off)
s10_e11_c12_u278	Oak, maple, elm, birch...
s10_e11_c12_u279	I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
s10_e11_c12_u280	Uhm... Buenos días, enchilada, por favor...
s10_e11_c12_u281	(sympathetic) Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
s10_e11_c12_u282	A match, a candle...
s10_e11_c12_u283	Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
s10_e11_c12_u284	A torch, a bonfire... (Joey seems lost) uhm, your pee...
s10_e11_c12_u285	Things that burn.
s10_e11_c12_u286	"I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly".
s10_e11_c12_u287	Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
s10_e11_c12_u288	Uhm, "I have fur", "I like to bark".
s10_e11_c12_u289	Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
s10_e11_c12_u290	Pepperoni...
s10_e11_c12_u291	(instantly) Pizza toppings, next!
s10_e11_c12_u292	Cindy Crawford, Christie Brinkley, Heidi Klum, Claudia Schiffer...
s10_e11_c12_u293	Oh, oh, oh... (5 seconds left)
s10_e11_c12_u294	Christie Turlington, Kate Moss...
s10_e11_c12_u295	Girls Chandler could never get?
s10_e11_c12_u296	(irritated) Supermodels!
s10_e11_c12_u297	Where? (looking around)
s10_e11_c13_u298	Hey, where's Rachel?
s10_e11_c13_u299	She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
s10_e11_c13_u300	Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
s10_e11_c13_u301	What? When was this?
s10_e11_c13_u302	Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
s10_e11_c13_u303	Oh my God! That's wild!
s10_e11_c13_u304	Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
s10_e11_c13_u305	Well, it matters to me.
s10_e11_c13_u306	Why?
s10_e11_c13_u307	Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
s10_e11_c13_u308	You kissed her that night too?
s10_e11_c13_u309	Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
s10_e11_c13_u310	Seriously, where did this happen?
s10_e11_c13_u311	Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
s10_e11_c13_u312	Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
s10_e11_c13_u313	Mine.
s10_e11_c13_u314	I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
s10_e11_c13_u315	No, she was definitely on my bed.
s10_e11_c13_u316	Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
s10_e11_c13_u317	Well, then who was on my bed?
s10_e11_c13_u318	(screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)
s10_e11_c13_u319	(realizing) NO! No, no!
s10_e11_c13_u320	YES! (Chandler gets an "oh no!" look on his face)
s10_e11_c13_u321	You were under the pile of coats?
s10_e11_c13_u322	I was the pile of coats!
s10_e11_c13_u323	OH MY GOD!
s10_e11_c13_u324	You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
s10_e11_c13_u325	You were my first kiss with Rachel?
s10_e11_c13_u326	You were my first kiss ever?
s10_e11_c13_u327	What did I marry into?
s10_e11_c14_u328	Oh, crap!
s10_e04_c02_u001	No, no, no, no, no!
s10_e04_c03_u002	Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
s06_e07_c01_u001	Ready?
s06_e07_c01_u002	Yeah.
s06_e07_c01_u003	Okay.
s06_e07_c01_u004	Hi...
s06_e07_c01_u005	it's...
s06_e07_c01_u006	Rachel...
s06_e07_c01_u007	and
s06_e07_c01_u008	Phoebe's...
s06_e07_c01_u009	please...
s06_e07_c01_u010	leave...
s06_e07_c01_u011	leave
s06_e07_c01_u012	Wait, I-I just said "leave."
s06_e07_c01_u013	Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it's," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
s06_e07_c01_u014	Phoebe, come on that's silly.
s06_e07_c01_u015	All right, so let's switch.
s06_e07_c01_u016	No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
s06_e07_c01_u017	Okay.
s06_e07_c01_u018	Okay.
s06_e07_c01_u019	Hi
s06_e07_c01_u020	Everybody
s06_e07_c01_u021	It's
s06_e07_c01_u022	Rachel
s06_e07_c01_u023	and
s06_e07_c01_u024	Phoebe's
s06_e07_c01_u025	Please...wait, how did you do that?
s06_e07_c01_u026	What?
s06_e07_c01_u027	Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?
s06_e07_c01_u028	Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
s06_e07_c01_u029	Really?
s06_e07_c01_u030	Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
s06_e07_c01_u031	Okay, let's go running!
s06_e07_c01_u032	Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
s06_e07_c01_u033	Let's run towards them!
s06_e07_c01_u034	OK!
s06_e07_c01_u035	All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!
s06_e07_c01_u036	Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
s06_e07_c01_u037	Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
s06_e07_c02_u038	So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
s06_e07_c02_u039	(not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
s06_e07_c02_u040	Hey!
s06_e07_c02_u041	(jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
s06_e07_c02_u042	I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
s06_e07_c02_u043	Oh, So you can move them!
s06_e07_c02_u044	Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
s06_e07_c02_u045	Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
s06_e07_c02_u046	Hi.
s06_e07_c02_u047	Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
s06_e07_c02_u048	Hi
s06_e07_c02_u049	Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
s06_e07_c02_u050	It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
s06_e07_c02_u051	Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
s06_e07_c02_u052	I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
s06_e07_c02_u053	So, uh, wh-where ya from?
s06_e07_c02_u054	Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
s06_e07_c02_u055	(shocked) From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
s06_e07_c02_u056	So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
s06_e07_c02_u057	I'm a dancer.
s06_e07_c02_u058	You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
s06_e07_c02_u059	Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
s06_e07_c02_u060	Oh, hey let me. (Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the door behind her gasps ecstatically.)
s06_e07_c02_u061	Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
s06_e07_c02_u062	Of course I did.
s06_e07_c02_u063	Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
s06_e07_c02_u064	"When can you move in?"
s06_e07_c02_u065	Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
s06_e07_c02_u066	Unbelievable
s06_e07_c02_u067	Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
s06_e07_c02_u068	Hey, look at all the boxes!
s06_e07_c02_u069	Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
s06_e07_c02_u070	Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
s06_e07_c02_u071	Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
s06_e07_c02_u072	All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
s06_e07_c02_u073	Oh God, yeah.
s06_e07_c02_u074	Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
s06_e07_c02_u075	(happily) Okay!
s06_e07_c02_u076	No-no
s06_e07_c02_u077	Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
s06_e07_c02_u078	Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
s06_e07_c02_u079	Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
s06_e07_c02_u080	(chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
s06_e07_c02_u081	You a little sad about that sweetheart?
s06_e07_c03_u082	I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
s06_e07_c03_u083	Okay. (Runs off.)
s06_e07_c03_u084	Okay. (Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far apart) Come on! That's not running! Let's go! (Rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)
s06_e07_c04_u085	You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
s06_e07_c04_u086	Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
s06_e07_c04_u087	Oh! I used to do that too!
s06_e07_c04_u088	Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
s06_e07_c04_u089	Aw, Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)
s06_e07_c04_u090	So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
s06_e07_c04_u091	Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
s06_e07_c04_u092	Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
s06_e07_c04_u093	Yeah.
s06_e07_c04_u094	You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
s06_e07_c04_u095	Hey!
s06_e07_c04_u096	Hey!
s06_e07_c04_u097	Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
s06_e07_c04_u098	Why? Why would you do that?
s06_e07_c04_u099	I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
s06_e07_c04_u100	Ankle.
s06_e07_c04_u101	We'll see.
s06_e07_c05_u102	OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the giggling again)
s06_e07_c05_u103	(jumps out of the box) I Gotcha!!
s06_e07_c05_u104	(pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
s06_e07_c05_u105	Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
s06_e07_c05_u106	Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
s06_e07_c05_u107	(raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
s06_e07_c05_u108	Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
s06_e07_c05_u109	Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. (Gives Chandler the "Joey-love," look.) How you doin?
s06_e07_c06_u110	(voice cracking) Ohhhh man
s06_e07_c06_u111	Sorry, there's just more room out here.
s06_e07_c06_u112	No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too. (Starts to stretch, groans painfully)
s06_e07_c06_u113	(touches his waist) Why don't you try to do-
s06_e07_c06_u114	(jumps up and yells)
s06_e07_c06_u115	What's wrong?
s06_e07_c06_u116	Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. (Goes into the bathroom and comes back out quickly) Oh my God!
s06_e07_c07_u117	(jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
s06_e07_c07_u118	No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
s06_e07_c07_u119	Please Rachel, I am not an idiot. (Runs off)
s06_e07_c07_u120	No, wait Phoebe.
s06_e07_c08_u121	(enters) Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin?
s06_e07_c08_u122	What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
s06_e07_c08_u123	Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
s06_e07_c08_u124	Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
s06_e07_c08_u125	Put it back exactly where you found it?
s06_e07_c08_u126	Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found it.
s06_e07_c08_u127	Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
s06_e07_c08_u128	She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
s06_e07_c08_u129	Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
s06_e07_c08_u130	She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
s06_e07_c08_u131	Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
s06_e07_c08_u132	I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
s06_e07_c08_u133	Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak-out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
s06_e07_c08_u134	No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.
s06_e07_c08_u135	(on phone) Hi!
s06_e07_c08_u136	Hey Mon, how's it going?
s06_e07_c08_u137	Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
s06_e07_c08_u138	Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
s06_e07_c08_u139	It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
s06_e07_c08_u140	No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
s06_e07_c08_u141	It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.
s06_e07_c08_u142	Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a picture frame off the table.) And that goes back up there.
s06_e07_c09_u143	We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
s06_e07_c09_u144	Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
s06_e07_c09_u145	What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
s06_e07_c09_u146	Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
s06_e07_c09_u147	OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
s06_e07_c09_u148	Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
s06_e07_c09_u149	Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
s06_e07_c09_u150	(entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffee table...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!? (Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
s06_e07_c09_u151	Hey, I've been married 3 times
s06_e07_c09_u152	No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
s06_e07_c09_u153	Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
s06_e07_c09_u154	Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
s06_e07_c09_u155	Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
s06_e07_c09_u156	Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
s06_e07_c09_u157	Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
s06_e07_c09_u158	That's not specific to girls.
s06_e07_c09_u159	This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
s06_e07_c09_u160	Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
s06_e07_c09_u161	And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
s06_e07_c09_u162	They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
s06_e07_c09_u163	Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
s06_e07_c09_u164	(nonchalantly) I'm never gonna find love again.
s06_e07_c10_u165	Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
s06_e07_c10_u166	Sure
s06_e07_c10_u167	Okay, um, I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
s06_e07_c10_u168	So, what should you have done?
s06_e07_c10_u169	Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
s06_e07_c10_u170	Uh-Huh, Which is...?
s06_e07_c10_u171	Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)
s06_e07_c10_u172	So?
s06_e07_c10_u173	Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
s06_e07_c10_u174	Why do you care?
s06_e07_c10_u175	Because they're people.
s06_e07_c10_u176	But people that you don't know and will never see again.
s06_e07_c10_u177	Yes, but still. They're people-with eyes.
s06_e07_c10_u178	Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
s06_e07_c10_u179	I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
s06_e07_c10_u180	That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbor's dog.
s06_e07_c11_u181	Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
s06_e07_c11_u182	Who cares? I repel women.
s06_e07_c11_u183	(blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
s06_e07_c11_u184	What?!
s06_e07_c11_u185	(whispers) What?!
s06_e07_c11_u186	(to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
s06_e07_c11_u187	Why does anyone have to be naked?
s06_e07_c11_u188	Why is Ross naked?
s06_e07_c11_u189	I-I had to show Chandler something?
s06_e07_c11_u190	Naked?
s06_e07_c11_u191	Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
s06_e07_c11_u192	Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
s06_e07_c11_u193	Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
s06_e07_c11_u194	Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
s06_e07_c11_u195	Bye! Thank God
s06_e07_c11_u196	Dude, what'd you have?
s06_e07_c11_u197	Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
s06_e07_c11_u198	(realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
s06_e07_c11_u199	That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo album)
s06_e07_c11_u200	So really, what'd ya have?
s06_e07_c12_u201	Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
s06_e07_c12_u202	Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
s06_e07_c12_u203	Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
s06_e07_c12_u204	Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
s06_e07_c12_u205	Is there something wrong?
s06_e07_c12_u206	All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
s06_e07_c12_u207	Joey...
s06_e07_c12_u208	No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
s06_e07_c12_u209	Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
s06_e07_c12_u210	Oh!
s06_e07_c12_u211	No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
s06_e07_c12_u212	Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
s06_e07_c12_u213	I don't think so.
s06_e07_c12_u214	Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?
s06_e07_c12_u215	I'm OK
s06_e07_c12_u216	What?!?!
s06_e07_c12_u217	What?
s06_e07_c12_u218	Oh dear God!
s06_e07_c13_u219	(Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!
s06_e07_c13_u220	Hey!
s06_e07_c13_u221	Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
s06_e07_c13_u222	See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
s06_e07_c13_u223	Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs off.)
s06_e07_c14_u224	Is it okay for me to come in now?
s06_e07_c14_u225	Uh-huh
s06_e07_c14_u226	Why is everything different?
s06_e07_c14_u227	Bye! (Runs out)
s06_e07_c14_u228	No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)
s06_e07_c14_u229	Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
s06_e07_c14_u230	Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
s06_e07_c14_u231	It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
s06_e07_c14_u232	Do you want me to be afraid of you?
s06_e07_c14_u233	Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
s06_e07_c14_u234	Really?
s06_e07_c14_u235	Of course!
s06_e07_c14_u236	Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
s06_e07_c14_u237	All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves on) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
s06_e07_c15_u238	So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
s06_e07_c15_u239	...and live forever as a machine!
s06_e07_c15_u240	That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
s06_e07_c15_u241	Yeah, I gotta go.
s06_e07_c15_u242	Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
s07_e08_c01_u001	(entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
s07_e08_c01_u002	No, no, no. No-no-no.
s07_e08_c01_u003	What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
s07_e08_c01_u004	No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
s07_e08_c01_u005	What? That's like insanely easy!
s07_e08_c01_u006	Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).
s07_e08_c01_u007	It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
s07_e08_c01_u008	What? You forgot fourteen states?
s07_e08_c01_u009	Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (That's true in so many ways, trust me, I've lived in one and been to the other.)
s07_e08_c01_u010	Oh, okay, time's up!
s07_e08_c01_u011	All right, I got 48.
s07_e08_c01_u012	Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
s07_e08_c01_u013	Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.
s07_e08_c01_u014	Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in-vegetables, Joey?
s07_e08_c01_u015	Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
s07_e08_c01_u016	Wow, how many have you got?
s07_e08_c01_u017	Fifty-six!
s07_e08_c02_u018	Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
s07_e08_c02_u019	Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.
s07_e08_c02_u020	(counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?
s07_e08_c02_u021	'Cause you invited your assistant.
s07_e08_c02_u022	Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
s07_e08_c02_u023	Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
s07_e08_c02_u024	Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
s07_e08_c02_u025	Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but I still do.
s07_e08_c02_u026	Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)
s07_e08_c02_u027	Done! With time a-to-spare.
s07_e08_c02_u028	Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)
s07_e08_c02_u029	You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
s07_e08_c02_u030	Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)
s07_e08_c02_u031	What? That's impossible.
s07_e08_c02_u032	46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
s07_e08_c02_u033	All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
s07_e08_c02_u034	I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!
s07_e08_c02_u035	No, just give me another minute.
s07_e08_c02_u036	Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
s07_e08_c02_u037	This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
s07_e08_c02_u038	Okay, but if you can't-no dinner!
s07_e08_c02_u039	You're on!
s07_e08_c02_u040	(gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
s07_e08_c02_u041	(entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
s07_e08_c02_u042	But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
s07_e08_c02_u043	Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
s07_e08_c02_u044	Pshhshhh!
s07_e08_c02_u045	Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)
s07_e08_c02_u046	Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
s07_e08_c02_u047	Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
s07_e08_c02_u048	Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
s07_e08_c02_u049	Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
s07_e08_c02_u050	Oh, it's not!
s07_e08_c02_u051	Seriously, it's moving!
s07_e08_c02_u052	What the hell is in there?
s07_e08_c02_u053	It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
s07_e08_c03_u054	Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
s07_e08_c03_u055	I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
s07_e08_c03_u056	That's my pie!
s07_e08_c03_u057	Which smells delicious!
s07_e08_c03_u058	Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
s07_e08_c03_u059	What?
s07_e08_c03_u060	We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
s07_e08_c04_u061	(answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
s07_e08_c04_u062	Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
s07_e08_c04_u063	I'm sorry, who's this?
s07_e08_c04_u064	Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
s07_e08_c04_u065	Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
s07_e08_c04_u066	No, there's no dog here?
s07_e08_c04_u067	Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica's apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
s07_e08_c04_u068	Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)
s07_e08_c04_u069	I'll be right there!
s07_e08_c04_u070	(Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're here already? How are they doing this?
s07_e08_c04_u071	(gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
s07_e08_c04_u072	I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
s07_e08_c04_u073	Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
s07_e08_c04_u074	We kinda broke up this morning.
s07_e08_c04_u075	Oh, I'm sorry.
s07_e08_c04_u076	Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
s07_e08_c04_u077	Ohio!! Thank you!
s07_e08_c04_u078	Huh! Where is the dog?!
s07_e08_c04_u079	What dog? There-there's no dog here.
s07_e08_c04_u080	Yeah that dog left!
s07_e08_c04_u081	(walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
s07_e08_c04_u082	There's no dog in here.
s07_e08_c04_u083	Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
s07_e08_c04_u084	No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
s07_e08_c04_u085	What is it doing here?
s07_e08_c04_u086	Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
s07_e08_c04_u087	Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
s07_e08_c04_u088	Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
s07_e08_c04_u089	That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
s07_e08_c04_u090	(gasping) Really?
s07_e08_c04_u091	Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
s07_e08_c04_u092	Well, it still has to go, right?
s07_e08_c04_u093	Okay, it's um
s07_e08_c04_u094	(interrupting him) Don't do it!
s07_e08_c04_u095	Don't do what?
s07_e08_c04_u096	(to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, "Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs.
s07_e08_c04_u097	What?
s07_e08_c04_u098	Are you crazy?
s07_e08_c04_u099	Are you out of your mind?
s07_e08_c04_u100	Why?
s07_e08_c04_u101	Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)
s07_e08_c04_u102	They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
s07_e08_c04_u103	Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
s07_e08_c04_u104	Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
s07_e08_c04_u105	(scared) Is there a puppy here?
s07_e08_c04_u106	You don't like puppies?
s07_e08_c04_u107	(to Tag) Okay, you are new!
s07_e08_c04_u108	Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
s07_e08_c04_u109	You don't like ice cream?
s07_e08_c04_u110	It's too cold.
s07_e08_c04_u111	Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
s07_e08_c04_u112	(to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.
s07_e08_c04_u113	And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!
s07_e08_c04_u114	How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
s07_e08_c04_u115	1250.
s07_e08_c04_u116	Damn, I forgot you were here.
s07_e08_c04_u117	All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)
s07_e08_c04_u118	Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
s07_e08_c04_u119	Yeah.
s07_e08_c04_u120	When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
s07_e08_c04_u121	Oh, I'd say about a month.
s07_e08_c04_u122	Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
s07_e08_c04_u123	Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
s07_e08_c04_u124	Interesting.
s07_e08_c04_u125	When it's your assistant, I would say never.
s07_e08_c04_u126	All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
s07_e08_c04_u127	Huh. A moo-point?
s07_e08_c04_u128	Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
s07_e08_c04_u129	(to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
s07_e08_c04_u130	Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
s07_e08_c04_u131	You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
s07_e08_c04_u132	Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
s07_e08_c04_u133	Hey!
s07_e08_c04_u134	Hey.
s07_e08_c04_u135	How are you holding up?
s07_e08_c04_u136	Not bad.
s07_e08_c04_u137	Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
s07_e08_c04_u138	Thanks.
s07_e08_c04_u139	So were you guys together a long time?
s07_e08_c04_u140	A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
s07_e08_c04_u141	Now that she broke up with you?
s07_e08_c04_u142	Yeah.
s07_e08_c04_u143	Yeah. Hmmmm.
s07_e08_c04_u144	It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
s07_e08_c04_u145	No-Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it-it has to work out.
s07_e08_c04_u146	Why?
s07_e08_c04_u147	Because, uh-it has to.
s07_e08_c04_u148	You have all the answers, don't you?
s07_e08_c04_u149	Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
s07_e08_c04_u150	Hey, thanks for talking to me.
s07_e08_c04_u151	Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)
s07_e08_c04_u152	(through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
s07_e08_c04_u153	What?
s07_e08_c04_u154	(realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)
s07_e08_c05_u155	What did Joey say? I like you back?
s07_e08_c05_u156	Uh, yeah, well, see, he- Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and-you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
s07_e08_c05_u157	Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
s07_e08_c05_u158	No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
s07_e08_c05_u159	Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.)
s07_e08_c05_u160	Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
s07_e08_c05_u161	(looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (He points down to the street)
s07_e08_c05_u162	What?
s07_e08_c05_u163	Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!!
s07_e08_c05_u164	Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
s07_e08_c05_u165	I can't believe this! (He walks back in again)
s07_e08_c05_u166	(she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too)
s07_e08_c06_u167	Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.
s07_e08_c06_u168	(doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
s07_e08_c06_u169	Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
s07_e08_c06_u170	Yeah, okay.
s07_e08_c06_u171	Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!
s07_e08_c06_u172	You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
s07_e08_c06_u173	That's not gonna work.
s07_e08_c06_u174	I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
s07_e08_c06_u175	Hey! I didn't know either.
s07_e08_c06_u176	Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
s07_e08_c06_u177	Yeah, I knew.
s07_e08_c07_u178	Where's Chandler?
s07_e08_c07_u179	(comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.
s07_e08_c07_u180	Wash your hands!!!
s07_e08_c07_u181	How did you-know? (Heads back into the bathroom)
s07_e08_c07_u182	Hey! What's she doing back here?
s07_e08_c07_u183	Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
s07_e08_c07_u184	Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
s07_e08_c07_u185	(interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
s07_e08_c07_u186	Yeah, but, but look what I'm...
s07_e08_c07_u187	See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)
s07_e08_c07_u188	(comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?
s07_e08_c07_u189	Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
s07_e08_c07_u190	Why not?
s07_e08_c07_u191	Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
s07_e08_c07_u192	Well, I, I should go in there.
s07_e08_c07_u193	No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
s07_e08_c07_u194	Why not?
s07_e08_c07_u195	Because you sent away the dog!
s07_e08_c07_u196	This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)
s07_e08_c07_u197	Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend-Phyllis-take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
s07_e08_c07_u198	(entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?
s07_e08_c07_u199	Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
s07_e08_c07_u200	So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.
s07_e08_c07_u201	Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
s07_e08_c07_u202	Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
s07_e08_c07_u203	And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)
s07_e08_c07_u204	Ross, you need some help?
s07_e08_c07_u205	From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying) Yes, please!
s07_e08_c07_u206	(sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
s07_e08_c07_u207	I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
s07_e08_c07_u208	Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
s07_e08_c07_u209	Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
s07_e08_c07_u210	If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
s07_e08_c07_u211	(opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?
s07_e08_c07_u212	No, no he went for a walk.
s07_e08_c07_u213	Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
s07_e08_c07_u214	(gasps) Hi!
s07_e08_c07_u215	Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
s07_e08_c07_u216	Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
s07_e08_c07_u217	You think?
s07_e08_c07_u218	Hi, honey.
s07_e08_c07_u219	Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
s07_e08_c07_u220	What? Why, why would...
s07_e08_c07_u221	(interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
s07_e08_c07_u222	Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and-(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)
s07_e08_c07_u223	We have good news, look whose back!
s07_e08_c07_u224	(uncovers the dog) Hi!
s07_e08_c07_u225	Clunkers?! Oh my god!
s07_e08_c07_u226	That's right, she came back all by herself.
s07_e08_c07_u227	It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
s07_e08_c07_u228	(to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!
s07_e08_c07_u229	Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in-(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
s07_e08_c07_u230	Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.
s07_e08_c07_u231	It's up to you.
s07_e08_c07_u232	Oh, hi! How are you doing?
s07_e08_c07_u233	I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
s07_e08_c07_u234	Oh.
s07_e08_c07_u235	Thanks for having me over, you guys.
s07_e08_c07_u236	Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
s07_e08_c07_u237	Colorado.
s07_e08_c07_u238	Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)
s07_e08_c07_u239	Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
s07_e08_c07_u240	Okay.
s07_e08_c07_u241	Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?
s07_e08_c07_u242	Um, I'm not.
s07_e08_c07_u243	Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.
s07_e08_c07_u244	No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
s07_e08_c07_u245	Really?
s07_e08_c07_u246	Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her)
s07_e08_c07_u247	Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
s07_e08_c08_u248	Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!
s07_e08_c08_u249	All right.
s07_e08_c08_u250	(hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!
s07_e08_c08_u251	You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice.
s07_e08_c08_u252	(pauses) I know.
s07_e08_c08_u253	Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
s05_e12_c01_u001	Come on Joey!!!
s05_e12_c01_u002	Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
s05_e12_c01_u003	I can't believe you would say that!
s05_e12_c01_u004	Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
s05_e12_c01_u005	No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the couch.) Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
s05_e12_c01_u006	(thinks) I don't know.
s05_e12_c01_u007	Is he romantic with her?
s05_e12_c01_u008	I don't know.
s05_e12_c01_u009	Are they in love?
s05_e12_c01_u010	(thinks) I don't know.
s05_e12_c01_u011	You don't know anything.
s05_e12_c01_u012	Ohh, I know one thing!
s05_e12_c01_u013	What?
s05_e12_c01_u014	They did it right there on the couch.
s05_e12_c02_u015	Hey Ross!
s05_e12_c02_u016	Hey!
s05_e12_c02_u017	(disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
s05_e12_c02_u018	What? Oh!
s05_e12_c02_u019	Sorry man.
s05_e12_c02_u020	Here's your scone.
s05_e12_c02_u021	Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
s05_e12_c02_u022	Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
s05_e12_c02_u023	Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
s05_e12_c02_u024	Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.
s05_e12_c02_u025	Exactly! Because it's in the past!
s05_e12_c02_u026	(eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?
s05_e12_c03_u027	Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
s05_e12_c03_u028	Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
s05_e12_c03_u029	I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
s05_e12_c03_u030	I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)
s05_e12_c03_u031	Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)
s05_e12_c03_u032	Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
s05_e12_c03_u033	I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
s05_e12_c03_u034	Hi, nice to meet you!
s05_e12_c03_u035	Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
s05_e12_c03_u036	Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! (Slaps Chandler on his butt.)
s05_e12_c03_u037	Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?
s05_e12_c03_u038	No, sir.
s05_e12_c03_u039	Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe.
s05_e12_c03_u040	Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. (They walk off leaving Chandler and Monica alone.)
s05_e12_c03_u041	What was that?
s05_e12_c03_u042	What?
s05_e12_c03_u043	That noise you just made?
s05_e12_c03_u044	Oh, that was my work laugh.
s05_e12_c03_u045	Really? Your work laugh?
s05_e12_c03_u046	Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
s05_e12_c03_u047	All right, check me out.
s05_e12_c03_u048	Okay.
s05_e12_c03_u049	says $30 Father; same as in town.
s05_e12_c04_u050	Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
s05_e12_c04_u051	Really?
s05_e12_c04_u052	And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
s05_e12_c04_u053	Hey, I thought you already had one.
s05_e12_c04_u054	Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at-bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
s05_e12_c04_u055	Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
s05_e12_c04_u056	Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)
s05_e12_c04_u057	(To Monica) Hey!
s05_e12_c04_u058	Hi!
s05_e12_c04_u059	What's up?!
s05_e12_c04_u060	What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
s05_e12_c04_u061	Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
s05_e12_c04_u062	Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
s05_e12_c04_u063	Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
s05_e12_c04_u064	Okay. Umm
s05_e12_c04_u065	Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
s05_e12_c04_u066	Okay, what's going on with you?
s05_e12_c04_u067	Nothing! You go!
s05_e12_c04_u068	Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
s05_e12_c04_u069	Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?
s05_e12_c04_u070	Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
s05_e12_c04_u071	No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.
s05_e12_c05_u072	Okay, then what happened?
s05_e12_c05_u073	(gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!
s05_e12_c05_u074	(entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
s05_e12_c05_u075	Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This is not over!
s05_e12_c05_u076	No! No! No!
s05_e12_c05_u077	What?!
s05_e12_c05_u078	I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in- (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!
s05_e12_c05_u079	(entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
s05_e12_c05_u080	Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
s05_e12_c05_u081	Really?
s05_e12_c05_u082	Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
s05_e12_c05_u083	Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
s05_e12_c05_u084	That's okay, Joe.
s05_e12_c05_u085	All right, let's go Pheebs.
s05_e12_c05_u086	(licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!
s05_e12_c06_u087	Bing!
s05_e12_c06_u088	Oww!!
s05_e12_c06_u089	Game!
s05_e12_c06_u090	Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. (To his wife.) Are you all right sweethart?
s05_e12_c06_u091	(out of breath and mouths) I'm not all right.
s05_e12_c06_u092	We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.
s05_e12_c06_u093	Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
s05_e12_c06_u094	Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
s05_e12_c06_u095	I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
s05_e12_c06_u096	Let them win one.
s05_e12_c06_u097	Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.
s05_e12_c06_u098	You're not even giving them a chance!
s05_e12_c06_u099	They have racquets don't they?!
s05_e12_c06_u100	Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
s05_e12_c06_u101	Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!
s05_e12_c06_u102	I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
s05_e12_c06_u103	Oopsey, missed it!
s05_e12_c06_u104	I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and Kara and scores a point.)
s05_e12_c06_u105	Nice shot.
s05_e12_c06_u106	I got it!!
s05_e12_c06_u107	Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
s05_e12_c07_u108	I can't believe you let them win!
s05_e12_c07_u109	Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)
s05_e12_c07_u110	I was frustrated.
s05_e12_c07_u111	It was my racquet.
s05_e12_c07_u112	I was frustrated with you!
s05_e12_c07_u113	If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
s05_e12_c07_u114	Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.
s05_e12_c07_u115	Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
s05_e12_c08_u116	I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
s05_e12_c08_u117	Maybe we should check the trash chute.
s05_e12_c08_u118	Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
s05_e12_c08_u119	That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
s05_e12_c08_u120	Hey!
s05_e12_c08_u121	There he is!
s05_e12_c08_u122	Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.) Where the hell have you been?!!
s05_e12_c08_u123	Just, y'know out.
s05_e12_c08_u124	Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
s05_e12_c08_u125	What were you doing?
s05_e12_c08_u126	I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
s05_e12_c08_u127	You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
s05_e12_c08_u128	(snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
s05_e12_c08_u129	Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
s05_e12_c08_u130	He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
s05_e12_c08_u131	(entering) Ross you left you scarf in-(sees everyone.) Hey you guys. (Does the laugh.)
s05_e12_c09_u132	Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
s05_e12_c09_u133	Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
s05_e12_c09_u134	So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.
s05_e12_c09_u135	Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)
s05_e12_c09_u136	Oh! Okay! (To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Does her famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)
s05_e12_c09_u137	Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say
s05_e12_c09_u138	You two will have very hairy children.
s05_e12_c09_u139	Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
s05_e12_c09_u140	Ross! Janice?!
s05_e12_c09_u141	All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
s05_e12_c09_u142	Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
s05_e12_c09_u143	So are you actually gonna see her again?
s05_e12_c09_u144	Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
s05_e12_c09_u145	I am gonna see her again.
s05_e12_c09_u146	Damnit Phoebe!!
s05_e12_c10_u147	(entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!
s05_e12_c10_u148	My turn? What-what are you talking about?
s05_e12_c10_u149	Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.
s05_e12_c10_u150	What?!
s05_e12_c10_u151	I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
s05_e12_c10_u152	Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
s05_e12_c10_u153	Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
s05_e12_c10_u154	Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big-(Thinks)-ot.
s05_e12_c10_u155	What?!
s05_e12_c10_u156	Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
s05_e12_c10_u157	All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
s05_e12_c10_u158	Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)
s05_e12_c11_u159	All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
s05_e12_c11_u160	Uh-hmm.
s05_e12_c11_u161	All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
s05_e12_c11_u162	Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
s05_e12_c11_u163	Judge rules, no violation.
s05_e12_c11_u164	Ohhh.
s05_e12_c11_u165	(entering) Hey guys!
s05_e12_c11_u166	Hey!
s05_e12_c11_u167	Yeah!
s05_e12_c11_u168	Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
s05_e12_c11_u169	What?!
s05_e12_c11_u170	Are you serious?!
s05_e12_c11_u171	Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
s05_e12_c11_u172	You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We
s05_e12_c11_u173	And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
s05_e12_c11_u174	(turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
s05_e12_c11_u175	Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
s05_e12_c11_u176	Ohh, tough call.
s05_e12_c11_u177	Yeah.
s05_e12_c12_u178	But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill. (Chandler does the laugh.)
s05_e12_c12_u179	So how do you kids like your coffee?
s05_e12_c12_u180	Oh, none for me. Thanks.
s05_e12_c12_u181	Just a little bit of sugar.
s05_e12_c12_u182	Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh? (Once again, with the laugh.)
s05_e12_c12_u183	(To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?
s05_e12_c12_u184	Oh, you get used to it.
s05_e12_c12_u185	Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
s05_e12_c12_u186	So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
s05_e12_c12_u187	I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
s05_e12_c12_u188	Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
s05_e12_c12_u189	(entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not laugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?
s05_e12_c12_u190	What?
s05_e12_c12_u191	The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?
s05_e12_c12_u192	Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
s05_e12_c12_u193	Excuse me?
s05_e12_c12_u194	Well, I just
s05_e12_c12_u195	(interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
s05_e12_c12_u196	Really?
s05_e12_c12_u197	Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
s05_e12_c12_u198	I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.
s05_e12_c12_u199	I thought you could use the help.
s05_e12_c12_u200	Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)
s05_e12_c13_u201	(entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?
s05_e12_c13_u202	Sure! Why?
s05_e12_c13_u203	Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
s05_e12_c13_u204	What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
s05_e12_c13_u205	(from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
s05_e12_c13_u206	Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
s05_e12_c13_u207	But we're not ready to tell yet!
s05_e12_c13_u208	I know! It's just that-ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
s05_e12_c13_u209	(entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
s05_e12_c13_u210	Hey! Hi!
s05_e12_c13_u211	Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]
s05_e12_c13_u212	Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
s05_e12_c13_u213	Okay great!
s05_e12_c13_u214	Yeah!
s05_e12_c13_u215	Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
s05_e12_c13_u216	Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
s05_e12_c13_u217	Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
s05_e12_c13_u218	That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
s05_e12_c13_u219	Okay.
s05_e12_c13_u220	Okay.
s05_e12_c13_u221	I'll get back to my new job.
s05_e12_c13_u222	'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and is almost in tears.)
s05_e12_c13_u223	Man, she is really gullible.
s05_e12_c14_u224	Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)
s05_e12_c14_u225	Thanks!
s05_e12_c14_u226	Actually, I should get going.
s05_e12_c14_u227	Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
s05_e12_c14_u228	Yes! Yes! You did!
s05_e12_c14_u229	Oh
s05_e12_c14_u230	What is wrong now?!
s05_e12_c14_u231	This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then
s05_e12_c14_u232	I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
s05_e12_c14_u233	Okay. Sometimes I feel
s05_e12_c14_u234	No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
s05_e12_c14_u235	Huh?
s05_e12_c14_u236	(starting to cry) You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
s05_e12_c14_u237	Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
s05_e12_c14_u238	Well yeah!!
s05_e12_c14_u239	OH-MY-GOD!!
s05_e12_c14_u240	Are you gonna be okay?
s05_e12_c14_u241	I am now.
s05_e12_c14_u242	Okay.
s05_e12_c14_u243	Umm, hi.
s05_e12_c14_u244	Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey. (Laughs and exits.)
s05_e12_c15_u245	Dude, we got to talk.
s05_e12_c15_u246	Okay.
s05_e12_c15_u247	I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?
s05_e12_c15_u248	Why would I be mad?
s05_e12_c15_u249	Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
s05_e12_c15_u250	(realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
s05_e12_c15_u251	Okay.
s05_e12_c15_u252	I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
s05_e12_c15_u253	All right.
s05_e12_c15_u254	And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!
s03_e16_c01_u001	I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
s03_e16_c01_u002	You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
s03_e16_c01_u003	Is this about Mark?
s03_e16_c01_u004	(shocked) Oh my God.
s03_e16_c01_u005	Okay, it's not, it's not.
s03_e16_c01_u006	Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
s03_e16_c01_u007	Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, (goes to the door) let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. (opens the door)
s03_e16_c01_u008	No. A break from us.
s03_e16_c02_u009	Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
s03_e16_c02_u010	(on the phone) I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
s03_e16_c02_u011	Hey, what do you want to drink?
s03_e16_c02_u012	Who's that?
s03_e16_c02_u013	Nobody.
s03_e16_c02_u014	Is that Mark?
s03_e16_c02_u015	Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
s03_e16_c02_u016	Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)
s03_e16_c03_u017	Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? Cause that's okay.
s03_e16_c04_u018	Hey.
s03_e16_c04_u019	Hey.
s03_e16_c04_u020	How's the big anniversary dinner?
s03_e16_c04_u021	Well, we never actually got to dinner.
s03_e16_c04_u022	Ohhh, nice.
s03_e16_c04_u023	No, we kinda broke up instead.
s03_e16_c04_u024	What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.)
s03_e16_c04_u025	(looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
s03_e16_c04_u026	That's okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on my ceiling! You broke up?!
s03_e16_c04_u027	Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
s03_e16_c04_u028	Oh no!!
s03_e16_c04_u029	No.
s03_e16_c04_u030	Rachel, you and Mark?!
s03_e16_c04_u031	No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
s03_e16_c05_u032	(entering from bathroom) Morning!
s03_e16_c06_u033	(on answering machine) Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
s03_e16_c06_u034	Yeah!!
s03_e16_c06_u035	Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
s03_e16_c06_u036	Na-huh.
s03_e16_c06_u037	So, I love you.
s03_e16_c06_u038	I love you.
s03_e16_c06_u039	And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30.
s03_e16_c06_u040	Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)
s03_e16_c06_u041	Bye.
s03_e16_c06_u042	Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
s03_e16_c06_u043	(entering from bedroom) Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
s03_e16_c06_u044	Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
s03_e16_c06_u045	But my apartment is so...
s03_e16_c06_u046	Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
s03_e16_c06_u047	Wait! Where's my shoes?
s03_e16_c06_u048	You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down and picks up a shoe)
s03_e16_c06_u049	Do I know why we're rushing?
s03_e16_c06_u050	Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He's frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
s03_e16_c06_u051	That's so great for you guys!
s03_e16_c06_u052	Yeah!
s03_e16_c06_u053	You must be so happy!
s03_e16_c06_u054	Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well.... (picks up her coat)
s03_e16_c06_u055	Good luck, with your girlfriend.
s03_e16_c06_u056	Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!
s03_e16_c06_u057	Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
s03_e16_c06_u058	Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
s03_e16_c06_u059	So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
s03_e16_c06_u060	Yes, you can, very much.
s03_e16_c06_u061	(seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
s03_e16_c07_u062	Hey!
s03_e16_c07_u063	Hey.
s03_e16_c07_u064	Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
s03_e16_c07_u065	Oh, there's banana on it.
s03_e16_c07_u066	Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
s03_e16_c07_u067	So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)
s03_e16_c07_u068	The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
s03_e16_c07_u069	Oh, good. Thanks.
s03_e16_c07_u070	Now what is Fabutec?
s03_e16_c07_u071	Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
s03_e16_c07_u072	Waxine!!
s03_e16_c07_u073	Yes! Have you seen it?
s03_e16_c07_u074	Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
s03_e16_c07_u075	I know!!
s03_e16_c07_u076	God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? Cause how can they do that?
s03_e16_c07_u077	Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
s03_e16_c07_u078	They have the best stuff in there.
s03_e16_c08_u079	Oh my God! Oh my God!
s03_e16_c08_u080	Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
s03_e16_c08_u081	You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
s03_e16_c08_u082	Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
s03_e16_c08_u083	What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
s03_e16_c08_u084	Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
s03_e16_c08_u085	He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
s03_e16_c08_u086	Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
s03_e16_c08_u087	Yeah, but don't you think....
s03_e16_c08_u088	All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
s03_e16_c08_u089	Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)
s03_e16_c08_u090	All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?
s03_e16_c08_u091	What trail?
s03_e16_c08_u092	(stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!
s03_e16_c08_u093	Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
s03_e16_c08_u094	Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
s03_e16_c09_u095	(reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
s03_e16_c09_u096	Did that!
s03_e16_c09_u097	Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
s03_e16_c09_u098	Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
s03_e16_c09_u099	Was it not pain-free?
s03_e16_c09_u100	No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
s03_e16_c09_u101	Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
s03_e16_c09_u102	That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
s03_e16_c09_u103	(Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
s03_e16_c09_u104	Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
s03_e16_c10_u105	(entering) Chloe? Hi..
s03_e16_c10_u106	Is this about me taking your watch?
s03_e16_c10_u107	You took my watch?
s03_e16_c10_u108	I'm sorry, I do that.
s03_e16_c10_u109	Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
s03_e16_c10_u110	Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
s03_e16_c10_u111	Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
s03_e16_c10_u112	Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
s03_e16_c10_u113	You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
s03_e16_c10_u114	You dog!
s03_e16_c10_u115	Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
s03_e16_c10_u116	Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
s03_e16_c10_u117	Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
s03_e16_c10_u118	Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
s03_e16_c10_u119	Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
s03_e16_c10_u120	Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
s03_e16_c10_u121	Actually, no, we're not.
s03_e16_c10_u122	Yeah, we are.
s03_e16_c10_u123	No, we're not.
s03_e16_c10_u124	Yeah, we are.
s03_e16_c10_u125	No, we're not!!
s03_e16_c10_u126	Okay, we're not.
s03_e16_c10_u127	Right.
s03_e16_c10_u128	But, we are.
s03_e16_c10_u129	Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
s03_e16_c10_u130	I can promise not to tell her again.
s03_e16_c11_u131	(entering out of breath) Jasmine?
s03_e16_c11_u132	Uh-huh.
s03_e16_c11_u133	We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
s03_e16_c11_u134	You did a bad thing!
s03_e16_c11_u135	Yes, I did.
s03_e16_c11_u136	Very bad!
s03_e16_c11_u137	Very bad.
s03_e16_c11_u138	Very, very bad.
s03_e16_c11_u139	I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
s03_e16_c11_u140	No.
s03_e16_c11_u141	Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
s03_e16_c11_u142	All right.
s03_e16_c11_u143	Thank you, thank you.
s03_e16_c11_u144	But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
s03_e16_c11_u145	(angrily) Who's your roommate?
s03_e16_c12_u146	Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
s03_e16_c12_u147	I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
s03_e16_c13_u148	Ow!
s03_e16_c13_u149	Oh!!
s03_e16_c13_u150	Ow!! Ow!!
s03_e16_c13_u151	Ow!!!
s03_e16_c13_u152	Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
s03_e16_c13_u153	We're all right.
s03_e16_c13_u154	It's okay, it's okay.
s03_e16_c13_u155	We're all right.
s03_e16_c13_u156	We were just waxing our legs.
s03_e16_c13_u157	Off?!!
s03_e16_c13_u158	For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
s03_e16_c13_u159	Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
s03_e16_c13_u160	Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
s03_e16_c13_u161	Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey's arm and puts a strip on it.)
s03_e16_c13_u162	Oh, that's mature.
s03_e16_c13_u163	Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
s03_e16_c13_u164	Uh-huh.
s03_e16_c13_u165	That's right.
s03_e16_c13_u166	(forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
s03_e16_c13_u167	I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
s03_e16_c13_u168	What?
s03_e16_c13_u169	Nothing, nothing.
s03_e16_c13_u170	(going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.
s03_e16_c13_u171	(to Joey) What, what are they talking about?
s03_e16_c13_u172	Rachel?
s03_e16_c13_u173	Just get away from me!
s03_e16_c13_u174	No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
s03_e16_c13_u175	A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
s03_e16_c13_u176	Whe-where did he put it?!
s03_e16_c13_u177	Ross, you had sex with another woman!
s03_e16_c13_u178	Oh my God.
s03_e16_c13_u179	Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
s03_e16_c13_u180	Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
s03_e16_c13_u181	Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
s03_e16_c13_u182	(to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
s03_e16_c13_u183	(opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
s03_e16_c13_u184	No!!
s03_e16_c13_u185	Just get out! Now!!
s03_e16_c13_u186	No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
s03_e16_c13_u187	Okay! All right! How was she?
s03_e16_c13_u188	Uh-oh.
s03_e16_c13_u189	What?
s03_e16_c13_u190	Was she good?
s03_e16_c13_u191	Don't answer that.
s03_e16_c13_u192	Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
s03_e16_c13_u193	She was...
s03_e16_c13_u194	Awful! Horrible!
s03_e16_c13_u195	She was not good. Not good.
s03_e16_c13_u196	She was nothing compared to you.
s03_e16_c13_u197	She, she was different.
s03_e16_c13_u198	Ewwwww!
s03_e16_c13_u199	Uh-oh.
s03_e16_c13_u200	Good different?
s03_e16_c13_u201	Nobody likes change.
s03_e16_c13_u202	What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
s03_e16_c13_u203	Should we do something?
s03_e16_c13_u204	Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
s03_e16_c13_u205	I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
s03_e16_c13_u206	Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can't answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
s03_e16_c13_u207	Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
s03_e16_c13_u208	And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
s03_e16_c13_u209	Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
s03_e16_c13_u210	We were on a break!
s03_e16_c13_u211	That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
s03_e16_c13_u212	You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
s03_e16_c13_u213	Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
s03_e16_c13_u214	Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
s03_e16_c13_u215	Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to open the door)
s03_e16_c13_u216	(stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
s03_e16_c13_u217	Why not?! (to Chandler) I'm hungry.
s03_e16_c13_u218	Because they'll know we've been listening.
s03_e16_c13_u219	God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
s03_e16_c13_u220	Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
s03_e16_c13_u221	Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
s03_e16_c13_u222	Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
s03_e16_c13_u223	Yeah, we'll be fine.
s03_e16_c13_u224	Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
s03_e16_c13_u225	(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
s03_e16_c13_u226	Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.
s03_e16_c13_u227	Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
s03_e16_c13_u228	All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
s03_e16_c13_u229	(pause) Yes I would.
s03_e16_c13_u230	You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
s03_e16_c13_u231	(less sure) Yes.
s03_e16_c13_u232	You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
s03_e16_c13_u233	(covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
s03_e16_c13_u234	Ohhhhh!
s03_e16_c13_u235	What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
s03_e16_c13_u236	I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
s03_e16_c13_u237	Order a pizza like, I forgive you?'
s03_e16_c13_u238	Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.
s03_e16_c13_u239	We could eat the wax! It's organic.
s03_e16_c13_u240	Oh great, food with hair on it.
s03_e16_c13_u241	No, not the used wax.
s03_e16_c13_u242	Because that would be crazy?
s03_e16_c13_u243	Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
s03_e16_c13_u244	Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
s03_e16_c13_u245	No anchovies.
s03_e16_c13_u246	With ah, extra anchovies.
s03_e16_c13_u247	That's okay, I'll just pick em off.
s03_e16_c13_u248	Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
s03_e16_c13_u249	You can have the last piece, if you want.
s03_e16_c13_u250	Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
s03_e16_c13_u251	They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
s03_e16_c13_u252	Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
s03_e16_c13_u253	What if they don't?
s03_e16_c13_u254	You think I need a new walk?
s03_e16_c13_u255	What?
s03_e16_c13_u256	Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a take notice' walk.
s03_e16_c13_u257	Are you actually saying these words?
s03_e16_c13_u258	What, now you're not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
s03_e16_c13_u259	Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a come on' look.) Yeah, okay.
s03_e16_c13_u260	Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
s03_e16_c13_u261	Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
s03_e16_c13_u262	Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
s03_e16_c13_u263	That's....
s03_e16_c13_u264	That's what?!
s03_e16_c13_u265	That is neither here nor there.
s03_e16_c13_u266	Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
s03_e16_c13_u267	No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
s03_e16_c13_u268	Okay, okay, okay.
s03_e16_c13_u269	(softly) I think you should go.
s03_e16_c13_u270	What?
s03_e16_c13_u271	(softly) I really think you need to go now.
s03_e16_c13_u272	(moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
s03_e16_c13_u273	Yeah, what the hell did I know!
s03_e16_c13_u274	Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....
s03_e16_c13_u275	(crying) No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
s03_e16_c13_u276	(crying) Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
s03_e16_c13_u277	Then how come it is?
s03_e16_c14_u278	They've been quiet for a long time.
s03_e16_c14_u279	Maybe she killed him?
s03_e16_c14_u280	Let's go.
s03_e16_c14_u281	(to Joey) Is that your new walk?
s03_e16_c14_u282	(whispering) No, I really have to pee.
s03_e11_c01_u001	Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
s03_e11_c01_u002	Um-mm.
s03_e11_c01_u003	All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.
s03_e11_c01_u004	Real magic does exist.
s03_e11_c01_u005	Wow.
s03_e11_c01_u006	Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?
s03_e11_c01_u007	I can't tell you that, no.
s03_e11_c01_u008	Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
s03_e11_c01_u009	Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
s03_e11_c01_u010	He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
s03_e11_c01_u011	Why don't you go up there and ask him to step lightly, please?'
s03_e11_c01_u012	I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
s03_e11_c01_u013	Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
s03_e11_c01_u014	All right, be my guest.
s03_e11_c01_u015	Good luck.
s03_e11_c01_u016	All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow motion)
s03_e11_c01_u017	Oh, I got it.
s03_e11_c01_u018	(muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the rest is unintelligible).
s03_e11_c01_u019	(muffled) Whoa, you are very beautiful.
s03_e11_c01_u020	(muffled) Oh, thank you.
s03_e11_c02_u021	(entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
s03_e11_c02_u022	Honey, what's the matter?
s03_e11_c02_u023	I just saw Janice.
s03_e11_c02_u024	Oh.
s03_e11_c02_u025	Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
s03_e11_c02_u026	Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
s03_e11_c02_u027	Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
s03_e11_c02_u028	Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
s03_e11_c02_u029	Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
s03_e11_c02_u030	Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
s03_e11_c02_u031	It's Joey's birthday.
s03_e11_c02_u032	Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
s03_e11_c02_u033	Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
s03_e11_c02_u034	Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
s03_e11_c03_u035	(entering) How's that coffee comin,' dear?
s03_e11_c03_u036	(jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
s03_e11_c03_u037	I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
s03_e11_c03_u038	I know!
s03_e11_c03_u039	I'll bet your thinking, What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
s03_e11_c03_u040	Op.
s03_e11_c03_u041	Eh.
s03_e11_c03_u042	Oh, you got me.
s03_e11_c03_u043	Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
s03_e11_c03_u044	Oh, that sounds great.
s03_e11_c03_u045	Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)
s03_e11_c03_u046	Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
s03_e11_c03_u047	(opening the closet door revealing that it's full of tangled up hangers.) I need these hangers separated ASAP. (she is stunned) You're welcome.
s03_e11_c04_u048	Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
s03_e11_c04_u049	I know honey, I'm sorry.
s03_e11_c04_u050	Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
s03_e11_c04_u051	(gives her a look) Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
s03_e11_c04_u052	Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
s03_e11_c04_u053	(to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
s03_e11_c04_u054	I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... (starts to laugh again)
s03_e11_c04_u055	It's not funny, this is actually my job.
s03_e11_c04_u056	Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
s03_e11_c04_u057	Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
s03_e11_c04_u058	Ah, just one other thing.
s03_e11_c04_u059	Yes?!
s03_e11_c04_u060	I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
s03_e11_c04_u061	(looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?
s03_e11_c05_u062	(to Monica and Phoebe) Hey guys.
s03_e11_c05_u063	Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
s03_e11_c05_u064	Well, he's very charming.
s03_e11_c05_u065	I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
s03_e11_c05_u066	Well, you're just gonna have to try.
s03_e11_c05_u067	Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
s03_e11_c05_u068	I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' em around...
s03_e11_c05_u069	Chandler!
s03_e11_c05_u070	Hello-dillillio!!
s03_e11_c05_u071	Oh, somebody's feeling better.
s03_e11_c05_u072	(to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.
s03_e11_c05_u073	(to Monica) Take off your shirt!
s03_e11_c05_u074	Oh my!!
s03_e11_c05_u075	Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
s03_e11_c05_u076	Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
s03_e11_c05_u077	(entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
s03_e11_c05_u078	Hi!
s03_e11_c05_u079	Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
s03_e11_c05_u080	Wow!
s03_e11_c05_u081	I know!
s03_e11_c05_u082	What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
s03_e11_c05_u083	Uh-huh!
s03_e11_c05_u084	And he's, he's a total stranger?
s03_e11_c05_u085	Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
s03_e11_c05_u086	Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
s03_e11_c05_u087	What!?
s03_e11_c05_u088	Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
s03_e11_c05_u089	To be nice.
s03_e11_c05_u090	Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
s03_e11_c05_u091	No, only for sex.
s03_e11_c05_u092	Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
s03_e11_c05_u093	I didn't have to, because I was wearing my I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
s03_e11_c05_u094	Uh-huh.
s03_e11_c05_u095	(entering) Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! (all 7 of them look almost identical)
s03_e11_c05_u096	Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
s03_e11_c05_u097	(to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
s03_e11_c05_u098	How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
s03_e11_c05_u099	Hi Joey's sisters!
s03_e11_c05_u100	(to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!
s03_e11_c05_u101	Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
s03_e11_c05_u102	Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
s03_e11_c05_u103	No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
s03_e11_c05_u104	Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
s03_e11_c05_u105	(to Chandler) What cha doing?
s03_e11_c05_u106	Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
s03_e11_c05_u107	Oh!!
s03_e11_c05_u108	No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey's sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.
s03_e11_c05_u109	Hi.
s03_e11_c05_u110	Hi.
s03_e11_c05_u111	Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
s03_e11_c05_u112	Isn't that great?
s03_e11_c05_u113	Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
s03_e11_c05_u114	Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, Hummina-hummina-hummina.' (walks away)
s03_e11_c05_u115	That's excellent.
s03_e11_c06_u116	(to Rachel) So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
s03_e11_c06_u117	Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
s03_e11_c06_u118	How ya feelin'?
s03_e11_c06_u119	Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
s03_e11_c06_u120	Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
s03_e11_c06_u121	Yeah.
s03_e11_c06_u122	Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
s03_e11_c06_u123	Woooo hoooo!!!
s03_e11_c06_u124	Ow, no woo-hooing,' no woo-hooing.'
s03_e11_c06_u125	Why, what happened?
s03_e11_c06_u126	Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well, that's not the worst part.
s03_e11_c06_u127	What is the worse part?
s03_e11_c06_u128	I can't remember which sister.
s03_e11_c06_u129	(to Rachel) You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! (points to Chandler) This is men!!
s03_e11_c07_u130	Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
s03_e11_c07_u131	Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
s03_e11_c07_u132	How can you not know which one?
s03_e11_c07_u133	I mean that's unbelievable.
s03_e11_c07_u134	I mean, was it Gina?
s03_e11_c07_u135	Which one is Gina?
s03_e11_c07_u136	Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
s03_e11_c07_u137	No, no, no, that's Dina.
s03_e11_c07_u138	(to Monica) You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
s03_e11_c07_u139	We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
s03_e11_c07_u140	Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
s03_e11_c07_u141	That was me.
s03_e11_c07_u142	Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
s03_e11_c07_u143	That's okay.
s03_e11_c07_u144	That's all right.
s03_e11_c07_u145	That's okay.
s03_e11_c07_u146	(angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!
s03_e11_c07_u147	Hey, Joey.
s03_e11_c07_u148	Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)
s03_e11_c07_u149	Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)
s03_e11_c07_u150	Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
s03_e11_c07_u151	I just got off the phone with my sister.
s03_e11_c07_u152	Ah, which, which one?
s03_e11_c07_u153	Mary-Angela.
s03_e11_c07_u154	Mary-Angela.
s03_e11_c07_u155	Yeah.
s03_e11_c07_u156	Y'know which one was she again?
s03_e11_c07_u157	Why don't you ask Chandler, cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
s03_e11_c07_u158	It's gotta be the first one.
s03_e11_c07_u159	Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
s03_e11_c07_u160	Yep, I'm in a tree.
s03_e11_c08_u161	Did he call? Did Mark call?
s03_e11_c08_u162	No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
s03_e11_c08_u163	Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
s03_e11_c08_u164	I guess they're back from their date.
s03_e11_c08_u165	Music. Very nice.
s03_e11_c08_u166	Oh my God!
s03_e11_c08_u167	So, how are you?
s03_e11_c08_u168	I am good. I finished my book.
s03_e11_c08_u169	Oh yeah, what's it about?
s03_e11_c08_u170	I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
s03_e11_c08_u171	Yeah, I do. (they both run out)
s03_e11_c09_u172	Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
s03_e11_c09_u173	Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
s03_e11_c09_u174	All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
s03_e11_c09_u175	What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
s03_e11_c09_u176	Where in Cuba?
s03_e11_c10_u177	(shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
s03_e11_c10_u178	Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
s03_e11_c10_u179	I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
s03_e11_c10_u180	You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
s03_e11_c10_u181	Where's Mary-Angela?
s03_e11_c10_u182	She's right in there. (motions to the living room)
s03_e11_c10_u183	Hey, Chandler!
s03_e11_c11_u184	I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
s03_e11_c11_u185	Bummer.
s03_e11_c11_u186	(to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
s03_e11_c11_u187	No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
s03_e11_c11_u188	Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. (they both look up in shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
s03_e11_c11_u189	But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
s03_e11_c11_u190	(to Ross) Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
s03_e11_c11_u191	(to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
s03_e11_c11_u192	Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
s03_e11_c11_u193	That's right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at Monica)
s03_e11_c11_u194	(on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no, don't you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I'll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
s03_e11_c11_u195	That is so made up!
s03_e11_c11_u196	(on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!
s03_e11_c11_u197	Yay!
s03_e11_c11_u198	There you go.
s03_e11_c11_u199	He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
s03_e11_c11_u200	Oh, that is amazing!
s03_e11_c11_u201	Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
s03_e11_c11_u202	I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
s03_e11_c11_u203	High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
s03_e11_c11_u204	Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo hoo!
s03_e11_c11_u205	You go get em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
s03_e11_c11_u206	What?
s03_e11_c11_u207	Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
s03_e11_c11_u208	Are you crazy?!
s03_e11_c11_u209	Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
s03_e11_c11_u210	What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
s03_e11_c11_u211	No.
s03_e11_c11_u212	I mean don't you trust her?
s03_e11_c11_u213	Well, yeah!
s03_e11_c11_u214	Then get over yourself! Grow up!
s03_e11_c11_u215	(shyly) You grow up.
s03_e11_c12_u216	This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
s03_e11_c12_u217	No! I did!
s03_e11_c12_u218	Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
s03_e11_c12_u219	Of course! It's her favorite.
s03_e11_c12_u220	So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
s03_e11_c12_u221	More of Grandma's teramisu.
s03_e11_c12_u222	Would you just please....give me the receipt cause this is great. It's top notch.
s03_e11_c12_u223	That dies with me.
s03_e11_c12_u224	So will I.
s03_e11_c12_u225	Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
s03_e11_c12_u226	Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
s03_e11_c12_u227	(whispering in his ear) Just do it.
s03_e11_c12_u228	Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
s03_e11_c12_u229	(startled) Hey!
s03_e11_c12_u230	Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)
s03_e11_c12_u231	Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
s03_e11_c12_u232	So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
s03_e11_c12_u233	Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
s03_e11_c12_u234	No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
s03_e11_c12_u235	This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
s03_e11_c12_u236	(standing behind Chandler) I am!
s03_e11_c12_u237	Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn't see Mary-Angela)
s03_e11_c12_u238	Joey!!!
s03_e11_c12_u239	No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
s03_e11_c12_u240	What's goin' on?
s03_e11_c12_u241	(pats him on the shoulder) You're it! Now run and hide!
s03_e11_c12_u242	It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
s03_e11_c12_u243	What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
s03_e11_c12_u244	I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey's sisters gasp) Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
s03_e11_c12_u245	I say, punch him Joey.
s03_e11_c12_u246	Yeah! Punch him!!
s03_e11_c12_u247	Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?
s03_e11_c12_u248	Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
s03_e11_c12_u249	Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
s03_e11_c12_u250	So what. I say, punch him.
s03_e11_c12_u251	Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
s03_e11_c12_u252	No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
s03_e11_c12_u253	I'll do it.
s03_e11_c12_u254	No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, (to Chandler) you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
s03_e11_c12_u255	Okay, absolutely!
s03_e11_c12_u256	All right.
s03_e11_c12_u257	You've got it. (he starts to look at his sister's, but he still doesn't know which one is Mary-Angela.)
s03_e11_c12_u258	Cookie, now you can punch him!
s03_e11_c12_u259	What?! (Cookie punches him)
s03_e11_c13_u260	(getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!
s03_e11_c13_u261	Hi!
s03_e11_c13_u262	What are you doing here?
s03_e11_c13_u263	Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)
s03_e11_c13_u264	Oh.
s03_e11_c13_u265	Hi. (kisses her)
s03_e11_c13_u266	Hi.
s03_e11_c13_u267	How'd did it go?
s03_e11_c13_u268	Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
s03_e11_c13_u269	I'm so proud of you.
s03_e11_c13_u270	Me too!
s03_e11_c13_u271	Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
s03_e11_c13_u272	I know.
s03_e11_c13_u273	Yeah.
s03_e11_c13_u274	Yeah.
s03_e11_c13_u275	Rachel?
s03_e11_c13_u276	Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!
s03_e11_c13_u277	Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
s03_e11_c13_u278	Oh, I did!
s03_e11_c13_u279	Yes.
s03_e11_c13_u280	(to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)
s03_e11_c13_u281	Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.
s03_e11_c14_u282	So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
s03_e11_c14_u283	Oh well y'know. (laughs)
s03_e11_c14_u284	Yeah, I do know.
s03_e11_c14_u285	Ick, you were eavesdropping.
s03_e11_c14_u286	Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
s03_e11_c14_u287	Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
s03_e11_c14_u288	Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
s03_e11_c14_u289	Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
s03_e11_c14_u290	All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel) But, is he a big guy?
s03_e11_c14_u291	Ah, we'll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)
s03_e11_c14_u292	Thanks you guys! Thank you.
s03_e11_c14_u293	Don't worry.
s03_e11_c14_u294	God, I hope they kick his ass!
s03_e11_c14_u295	Honey, I'm sorry.
s03_e11_c14_u296	Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)
s03_e11_c14_u297	(muffled) May I help you?
s10_e13_c01_u001	Hi
s10_e13_c01_u002	Hey! Hi!
s10_e13_c01_u003	How was the honeymoon?
s10_e13_c01_u004	Oh!
s10_e13_c01_u005	So, where's Mike?
s10_e13_c01_u006	Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
s10_e13_c01_u007	Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
s10_e13_c01_u008	Oh, why? What's up?
s10_e13_c01_u009	I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
s10_e13_c01_u010	Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
s10_e13_c01_u011	Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to Ross, sarcastically) By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
s10_e13_c01_u012	(whispering) It was ok...
s10_e13_c01_u013	I did not know you spoke French.
s10_e13_c01_u014	Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
s10_e13_c01_u015	Oh... you're so sexy!
s10_e13_c01_u016	Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
s10_e13_c01_u017	Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
s10_e13_c01_u018	Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
s10_e13_c02_u019	Hey.
s10_e13_c02_u020	Hey.
s10_e13_c02_u021	Why are you wearing my apron?
s10_e13_c02_u022	I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
s10_e13_c02_u023	Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?
s10_e13_c02_u024	(he enters) Hey.
s10_e13_c02_u025	Hey.
s10_e13_c02_u026	You guys know where Rachel is?
s10_e13_c02_u027	No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
s10_e13_c02_u028	So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)
s10_e13_c02_u029	Hey!
s10_e13_c02_u030	Hey!
s10_e13_c02_u031	These are for Erica!
s10_e13_c02_u032	What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
s10_e13_c02_u033	Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
s10_e13_c02_u034	So, why is Erica coming to visit?
s10_e13_c02_u035	Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
s10_e13_c02_u036	Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
s10_e13_c02_u037	Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
s10_e13_c02_u038	(looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
s10_e13_c02_u039	Ross...
s10_e13_c02_u040	No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
s10_e13_c02_u041	My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney’s.
s10_e13_c02_u042	Oh my God.
s10_e13_c02_u043	Honey.
s10_e13_c02_u044	I'm so sorry...
s10_e13_c02_u045	Is-is he ok?
s10_e13_c02_u046	Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
s10_e13_c02_u047	Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
s10_e13_c02_u048	No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
s10_e13_c02_u049	Still-still, let me come... for me.
s10_e13_c02_u050	Ok. If you really need to.
s10_e13_c02_u051	I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
s10_e13_c02_u052	Oh, I really could.
s10_e13_c02_u053	Oh!
s10_e13_c02_u054	Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
s10_e13_c03_u055	All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".

s10_e13_c03_u063	It does, really?
s10_e13_c03_u064	Yeah.

s10_e13_c03_u066	Got it.

s10_e13_c03_u074	I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
s10_e13_c03_u075	Oh!
s10_e13_c03_u076	Joey. Erica, baby!
s10_e13_c03_u077	Hi.
s10_e13_c03_u078	Everyone. Erica, baby!
s10_e13_c03_u079	Monica. Calm, self.
s10_e13_c03_u080	Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!
s10_e13_c03_u081	Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
s10_e13_c03_u082	Why would you say that?
s10_e13_c03_u083	Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
s10_e13_c03_u084	I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
s10_e13_c03_u085	Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
s10_e13_c03_u086	Oh yeah, let's do that!
s10_e13_c03_u087	Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.
s10_e13_c04_u088	(stopping a nurse who's coming out of a room) Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
s10_e13_c04_u089	And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
s10_e13_c04_u090	Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
s10_e13_c04_u091	Can somebody please go in?
s10_e13_c04_u092	Absolutely.
s10_e13_c04_u093	Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
s10_e13_c04_u094	Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
s10_e13_c04_u095	I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
s10_e13_c04_u096	He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
s10_e13_c04_u097	I'm feeling better.
s10_e13_c04_u098	Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
s10_e13_c04_u099	Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
s10_e13_c04_u100	Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
s10_e13_c04_u101	He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
s10_e13_c04_u102	Did the TV wake you?
s10_e13_c04_u103	No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
s10_e13_c04_u104	Ouchy.
s10_e13_c04_u105	What are you doing here, Geller?
s10_e13_c04_u106	Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! (pause) So what's new?
s10_e13_c04_u107	Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
s10_e13_c04_u108	Right, is it painful?
s10_e13_c04_u109	What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?
s10_e13_c04_u110	So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
s10_e13_c04_u111	Nope, just the one. RACH!
s10_e13_c05_u112	Je m'appelle Claude.
s10_e13_c05_u113	Je do call blue!
s10_e13_c05_u114	Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
s10_e13_c05_u115	je.
s10_e13_c05_u116	m'ap
s10_e13_c05_u117	mah

s10_e13_c05_u120	Great, ok faster! "je"
s10_e13_c05_u121	je.

s10_e13_c05_u123	mah
s10_e13_c05_u124	pelle
s10_e13_c05_u125	pel.
s10_e13_c05_u126	Je m'appelle!
s10_e13_c05_u127	Me pooh pooh!
s10_e13_c05_u128	Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
s10_e13_c05_u129	What are you doing?
s10_e13_c05_u130	I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall. (she leaves)
s10_e13_c05_u131	(he goes out calling her) Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! (he gives up). Pooh.
s10_e13_c06_u132	Hey!
s10_e13_c06_u133	Hi!
s10_e13_c06_u134	I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. (pause) I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
s10_e13_c06_u135	Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?
s10_e13_c06_u136	Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
s10_e13_c06_u137	Oh good.
s10_e13_c06_u138	Wow.
s10_e13_c06_u139	What?
s10_e13_c06_u140	Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
s10_e13_c06_u141	What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
s10_e13_c06_u142	Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
s10_e13_c06_u143	Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
s10_e13_c06_u144	Sorry. (Rachel sits on her bed). You ok?
s10_e13_c06_u145	Yeah.
s10_e13_c06_u146	You had a rough day, uh?
s10_e13_c06_u147	Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
s10_e13_c06_u148	But we do! (pause) It's gonna be ok, Rach!
s10_e13_c06_u149	(she's sad) Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
s10_e13_c06_u150	What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
s10_e13_c06_u151	What?
s10_e13_c06_u152	They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
s10_e13_c06_u153	Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
s10_e13_c06_u154	No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
s10_e13_c06_u155	Ok, maybe you're right.
s10_e13_c06_u156	(he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.
s10_e13_c06_u157	Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
s10_e13_c06_u158	Sure!
s10_e13_c06_u159	Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.
s10_e13_c06_u160	Oh, of course...
s10_e13_c06_u161	Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
s10_e13_c06_u162	Me too. Come here. (They hug)
s10_e13_c06_u163	I just don't want to be alone tonight.
s10_e13_c06_u164	Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(There's one of those moments. They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
s10_e13_c06_u165	Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
s10_e13_c06_u166	No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
s10_e13_c06_u167	Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
s10_e13_c06_u168	Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
s10_e13_c06_u169	Wow. Ok.
s10_e13_c06_u170	I'll see you in the morning (he leaves).
s10_e13_c06_u171	Mhm-mh!
s10_e13_c06_u172	(outside her room, talking by himself) Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
s10_e13_c07_u173	Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
s10_e13_c07_u174	Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
s10_e13_c07_u175	(enters the room wearing an "I love New York" t-shirt, a "Statue of Liberty" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!
s10_e13_c07_u176	What is with you?
s10_e13_c07_u177	Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
s10_e13_c07_u178	Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
s10_e13_c07_u179	Thanks so much for showing me around.
s10_e13_c07_u180	Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
s10_e13_c07_u181	Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)
s10_e13_c07_u182	Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
s10_e13_c07_u183	Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)
s10_e13_c07_u184	That's great.
s10_e13_c07_u185	Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look confused now)
s10_e13_c07_u186	How's that now?
s10_e13_c07_u187	Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
s10_e13_c07_u188	So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
s10_e13_c07_u189	No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)
s10_e13_c07_u190	Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful)
s10_e13_c07_u191	No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy.
s10_e13_c07_u192	I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
s10_e13_c07_u193	Are you awake?
s10_e13_c07_u194	Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
s10_e13_c07_u195	Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
s10_e13_c07_u196	Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
s10_e13_c07_u197	Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
s10_e13_c07_u198	I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
s10_e13_c07_u199	How?
s10_e13_c07_u200	I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
s10_e13_c07_u201	Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
s10_e13_c07_u202	Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
s10_e13_c08_u203	We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.
s10_e13_c08_u204	Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
s10_e13_c08_u205	Good job.
s10_e13_c08_u206	Thank you.
s10_e13_c08_u207	Hey Joey.
s10_e13_c08_u208	Hey!
s10_e13_c08_u209	Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
s10_e13_c08_u210	Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
s10_e13_c08_u211	Really, can I hear some of it.
s10_e13_c08_u212	Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?
s10_e13_c08_u213	Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
s10_e13_c08_u214	(offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
s10_e13_c08_u215	How could you possibly think that?
s10_e13_c08_u216	For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
s10_e13_c09_u217	Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
s10_e13_c09_u218	(She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
s10_e13_c09_u219	You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
s10_e13_c09_u220	Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)
s10_e13_c09_u221	You sure you're alright?
s10_e13_c09_u222	(coldly) Yep.
s10_e13_c09_u223	(knowing she's not alright) O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)
s10_e13_c09_u224	FYI..
s10_e13_c09_u225	(knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)
s10_e13_c09_u226	In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)
s10_e13_c09_u227	(half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little) You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
s10_e13_c09_u228	(sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
s10_e13_c09_u229	(acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...
s10_e13_c09_u230	Oh stop that!
s10_e13_c09_u231	I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
s10_e13_c09_u232	(sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
s10_e13_c09_u233	Hey, I was looking out for you.
s10_e13_c09_u234	Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
s10_e13_c09_u235	I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
s10_e13_c09_u236	Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
s10_e13_c09_u237	Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
s10_e13_c09_u238	What?
s10_e13_c09_u239	That's right, sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green, are you feeling better? (Rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)
s10_e13_c10_u240	Hey! How was lunch?
s10_e13_c10_u241	(To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles at Chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)
s10_e13_c10_u242	(struggling) Oh, really?
s10_e13_c10_u243	No! (To Monica) You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
s10_e13_c10_u244	O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?
s10_e13_c10_u245	Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
s10_e13_c10_u246	Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
s10_e13_c10_u247	(smiling) No it's not.
s10_e13_c10_u248	How do you know?
s10_e13_c10_u249	Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
s10_e13_c10_u250	Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
s10_e13_c10_u251	The thing we never do.
s10_e13_c10_u252	(nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!
s10_e13_c11_u253	Whenever you're ready Joey.
s10_e13_c11_u254	Right. (clears his throat) Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
s10_e13_c11_u255	I'm sorry, what's going on?
s10_e13_c11_u256	Dude, come on! French it u-up!
s10_e13_c11_u257	Joey, do you speak French?
s10_e13_c11_u258	Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
s10_e13_c11_u259	You know what. I think this audition is over. (Joey looks disappointed, but understands.)
s10_e13_c11_u260	(in a French accent) Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
s10_e13_c11_u261	You really think this man is speaking French?
s10_e13_c11_u262	Sa-sa-saw!
s10_e13_c11_u263	Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé. (Translation: Listen, I will tell you the truth. He's my little bother. He's a bit retarded.)
s10_e13_c11_u264	Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... (Translation: So, would you please just humor him?)
s10_e13_c11_u265	(to Joey) Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
s10_e13_c11_u266	Ah. All right. But my French was good?
s10_e13_c11_u267	It was great.
s10_e13_c11_u268	(to Phoebe) Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
s10_e13_c11_u269	(to the director) Merci. Au revoir. (Translation: Thanks, goodbye.)
s10_e13_c11_u270	Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
s10_e13_c12_u271	Emma's down for the night.
s10_e13_c12_u272	Oh, good.
s10_e13_c12_u273	So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
s10_e13_c12_u274	Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
s10_e13_c12_u275	Oh, no problem.
s10_e13_c12_u276	And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
s10_e13_c12_u277	Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
s10_e13_c12_u278	It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
s10_e13_c12_u279	Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
s10_e13_c12_u280	Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
s10_e13_c12_u281	Oh, ye-ah!
s10_e13_c12_u282	You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
s10_e13_c12_u283	...Valentine's day...
s10_e13_c12_u284	(long pause, they realize) Oh yeah!
s10_e13_c12_u285	Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
s10_e13_c12_u286	Hmmm-mmmm.
s10_e13_c12_u287	(after a pause) Not even one more time?
s10_e13_c12_u288	Not even once.
s10_e13_c12_u289	No matter how much we want it.
s10_e13_c12_u290	Even if we want it really bad.
s10_e13_c12_u291	That's what we decided.
s10_e13_c12_u292	Uhm, right!
s10_e13_c12_u293	...It's kinda hard though!
s10_e13_c12_u294	Yeah.
s10_e13_c12_u295	You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
s10_e13_c12_u296	...I hate waste.
s10_e13_c12_u297	...Ross?
s10_e13_c12_u298	Yes?
s10_e13_c12_u299	Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
s10_e13_c12_u300	Damn it. It's never off the table. (he leaves the apartment)
s10_e13_c13_u301	Okay, can you really tapdance?
s10_e13_c13_u302	No.
s10_e13_c13_u303	It's off the resumé. (she strikes it through with a pencil)
s10_e13_c13_u304	Archery?
s10_e13_c13_u305	No.
s10_e13_c13_u306	Horseback riding?
s10_e13_c13_u307	Would fall off a lot.
s10_e13_c13_u308	You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
s10_e13_c13_u309	That I can do.
s10_e13_c13_u310	Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
s10_e13_c13_u311	All right, watch me! (he takes a full container of milk from the fridge) Okay, you time me. Ready?
s10_e13_c13_u312	Ready... GO!
s10_e13_c13_u313	(checking her watch) You did it!
s10_e01_c01_u001	Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)
s10_e01_c01_u002	You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
s10_e01_c01_u003	I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
s10_e01_c01_u004	You're on!
s10_e01_c01_u005	Hey!
s10_e01_c01_u006	What's up?
s10_e01_c01_u007	Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
s10_e01_c01_u008	... finally...
s10_e01_c01_u009	Is that Ross?
s10_e01_c01_u010	Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
s10_e01_c01_u011	Sounds like he's with someone.
s10_e01_c01_u012	He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
s10_e01_c01_u013	Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
s10_e01_c01_u014	Ooh... Dr. Geller!
s10_e01_c01_u015	God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
s10_e01_c01_u016	Oh my God, that's Charlie!
s10_e01_c01_u017	She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
s10_e01_c01_u018	Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
s10_e01_c01_u019	I'm not sure about this.
s10_e01_c01_u020	Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
s10_e01_c01_u021	No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
s10_e01_c01_u022	Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
s10_e01_c01_u023	(through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!
s10_e01_c01_u024	Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
s10_e01_c01_u025	I know, I'm her!
s10_e01_c01_u026	(whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
s10_e01_c01_u027	What?
s10_e01_c01_u028	Get over here!
s10_e01_c01_u029	ooh...
s10_e01_c01_u030	Wow!
s10_e01_c01_u031	(in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
s10_e01_c01_u032	(muffled) Thank you.
s10_e01_c01_u033	Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
s10_e01_c01_u034	Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
s10_e01_c01_u035	What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
s10_e01_c01_u036	I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
s10_e01_c01_u037	How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
s10_e01_c01_u038	I'm on it!
s10_e01_c01_u039	Anything?
s10_e01_c01_u040	I think I hear curtains closing...
s10_e01_c01_u041	We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
s10_e01_c01_u042	Bedsprings, unmistakable!
s10_e01_c01_u043	You do realise that's your brother?
s10_e01_c01_u044	Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
s10_e01_c01_u045	That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
s10_e01_c01_u046	Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
s10_e01_c01_u047	Okay Buckwheat!
s10_e01_c01_u048	You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)
s10_e01_c01_u049	Weh...*sigh*
s10_e01_c01_u050	uhm... Is everything okay?
s10_e01_c01_u051	Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
s10_e01_c01_u052	Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...
s10_e01_c01_u053	No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
s10_e01_c01_u054	I uhm... I completely understand.
s10_e01_c01_u055	Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later.
s10_e01_c01_u056	Okay...
s10_e01_c01_u057	That's the door. He's gone...
s10_e01_c01_u058	And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
s10_e01_c01_u059	Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
s10_e01_c01_u060	Hey, what are you guys doing?
s10_e01_c01_u061	Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)
s10_e01_c01_u062	(also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)
s10_e01_c01_u063	(caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!
s10_e01_c01_u064	Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
s10_e01_c01_u065	He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
s10_e01_c01_u066	Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
s10_e01_c01_u067	You got it!
s10_e01_c01_u068	Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)
s10_e01_c01_u069	Other wall, people! Other wall!
s10_e01_c01_u070	(knocks on door) Rach, you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)
s10_e01_c01_u071	Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
s10_e01_c01_u072	Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!
s10_e01_c01_u073	No idea what it means.
s10_e01_c01_u074	Oh... okay, just hide!
s10_e01_c01_u075	(knocks) Rach?
s10_e01_c01_u076	Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
s10_e01_c01_u077	There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)
s10_e01_c01_u078	Is everything okay?
s10_e01_c01_u079	Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)
s10_e01_c01_u080	Hey.
s10_e01_c01_u081	Hi...
s10_e01_c01_u082	You know where Joey is?
s10_e01_c01_u083	...I really don't... (looks around again)
s10_e01_c01_u084	Can I talk to you for a minute?
s10_e01_c01_u085	Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)
s10_e01_c01_u086	I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
s10_e01_c01_u087	Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
s10_e01_c01_u088	And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
s10_e01_c01_u089	(clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...
s10_e01_c01_u090	And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
s10_e01_c01_u091	(still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
s10_e01_c01_u092	Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
s10_e01_c01_u093	(now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
s10_e01_c01_u094	You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
s10_e01_c01_u095	You would think!
s10_e01_c01_u096	Joey!
s10_e01_c01_u097	Is he gone?
s10_e01_c01_u098	(still can't find him) How are you doing this?
s10_e01_c01_u099	Pssst...
s10_e01_c01_u100	How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
s10_e01_c01_u101	YE-AH!
s10_e01_c01_u102	Now, what is this?
s10_e01_c01_u103	Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
s10_e01_c01_u104	Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
s10_e01_c01_u105	Well, he's with Charlie now.
s10_e01_c01_u106	Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
s10_e01_c01_u107	(long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
s10_e01_c01_u108	All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
s10_e01_c01_u109	Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
s10_e01_c01_u110	Sure...
s10_e01_c01_u111	Enunciate!
s10_e01_c01_u112	Get out!
s10_e01_c01_u113	Are they right?
s10_e01_c01_u114	Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
s10_e01_c01_u115	Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
s10_e01_c01_u116	Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
s10_e01_c01_u117	(Joey walks to the door) Although...
s10_e01_c01_u118	(turns around very fast) I like although!
s10_e01_c01_u119	I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
s10_e01_c01_u120	Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
s10_e01_c01_u121	Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
s10_e01_c01_u122	Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
s10_e01_c01_u123	No...
s10_e01_c01_u124	I'm thinking about you...
s10_e01_c01_u125	Yeah...
s10_e01_c01_u126	Let's forget about Ross...
s10_e01_c01_u127	Forgotten.
s10_e01_c01_u128	What's wrong?
s10_e01_c01_u129	Nothing...
s10_e01_c01_u130	Seriously... What is it?
s10_e01_c01_u131	Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
s10_e01_c01_u132	What's wrong?
s10_e01_c01_u133	Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
s10_e01_c01_u134	Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)
s10_e01_c01_u135	Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head away again...)
s10_e01_c01_u136	Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
s10_e01_c01_u137	Yeah
s10_e01_c02_u138	Hey!
s10_e01_c02_u139	Hey!
s10_e01_c02_u140	You guys ready to go?
s10_e01_c02_u141	Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
s10_e01_c02_u142	Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
s10_e01_c02_u143	You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
s10_e01_c02_u144	Learn about Jesus...
s10_e01_c02_u145	Hey!
s10_e01_c02_u146	So, did you talk to Joey?
s10_e01_c02_u147	Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
s10_e01_c02_u148	Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
s10_e01_c02_u149	Stop it!
s10_e01_c02_u150	PHD
s10_e01_c02_u151	You're filthy!
s10_e01_c02_u152	Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
s10_e01_c02_u153	Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
s10_e01_c02_u154	Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
s10_e01_c02_u155	Check it out!
s10_e01_c02_u156	Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
s10_e01_c02_u157	Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
s10_e01_c02_u158	What do you think?
s10_e01_c02_u159	I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
s10_e01_c02_u160	Don't you just love it?
s10_e01_c02_u161	Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
s10_e01_c02_u162	It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
s10_e01_c02_u163	You've never said that in your life, have you?
s10_e01_c02_u164	Not once.
s10_e01_c02_u165	I thought so.
s10_e01_c02_u166	And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)
s10_e01_c02_u167	What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
s10_e01_c03_u168	Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
s10_e01_c03_u169	Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
s10_e01_c03_u170	Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
s10_e01_c03_u171	Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
s10_e01_c03_u172	I understand...
s10_e01_c03_u173	No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)
s10_e01_c03_u174	Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
s10_e01_c03_u175	Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
s10_e01_c03_u176	You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...
s10_e01_c03_u177	Aaah... you're not good at this...
s10_e01_c03_u178	You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
s10_e01_c03_u179	No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
s10_e01_c03_u180	Oh...
s10_e01_c03_u181	What?
s10_e01_c03_u182	Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
s10_e01_c03_u183	Why not?
s10_e01_c03_u184	I have a date.
s10_e01_c03_u185	You have a... You have a date? With who?
s10_e01_c03_u186	Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
s10_e01_c03_u187	(lets go of his hand) You have... have a girlfriend?
s10_e01_c03_u188	Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.
s10_e01_c03_u189	For how long?
s10_e01_c03_u190	Three months.
s10_e01_c03_u191	Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
s10_e01_c03_u192	I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
s10_e01_c03_u193	Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
s10_e01_c03_u194	Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
s10_e01_c03_u195	You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
s10_e01_c03_u196	Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
s10_e01_c03_u197	Okay... Good luck.
s10_e01_c03_u198	Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
s10_e01_c03_u199	I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
s10_e01_c03_u200	Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
s10_e01_c03_u201	Ooh...
s10_e01_c03_u202	Still nervous?
s10_e01_c03_u203	I'm gonna get the lasagna.
s10_e01_c03_u204	Hey Rach...
s10_e01_c03_u205	Yeah!
s10_e01_c03_u206	Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
s10_e01_c03_u207	Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths "Good luck" to Joey and gets up from her seat)
s10_e01_c03_u208	Hey!
s10_e01_c03_u209	Hey!
s10_e01_c03_u210	So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
s10_e01_c03_u211	Yeah?
s10_e01_c03_u212	Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
s10_e01_c03_u213	You kissed.
s10_e01_c03_u214	Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?
s10_e01_c03_u215	I saw you.
s10_e01_c03_u216	Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
s10_e01_c03_u217	Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
s10_e01_c03_u218	What?
s10_e01_c03_u219	It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
s10_e01_c03_u220	Are you serious?
s10_e01_c03_u221	Yeah... Now I have something...
s10_e01_c03_u222	I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
s10_e01_c03_u223	Oh... uh... look... before you...
s10_e01_c03_u224	No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
s10_e01_c03_u225	I am those things, yeah.
s10_e01_c03_u226	You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
s10_e01_c03_u227	Dude!
s10_e01_c03_u228	Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
s10_e01_c03_u229	I can't think of anything.
s10_e01_c03_u230	Thanks!
s10_e01_c03_u231	Yeah.
s10_e01_c03_u232	So hi!
s10_e01_c03_u233	Hi!
s10_e01_c03_u234	So you eh, you talked to Joey?
s10_e01_c03_u235	Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
s10_e01_c03_u236	Oh! That's great!
s10_e01_c03_u237	Yeah!
s10_e01_c03_u238	Oh, so everything's okay?
s10_e01_c03_u239	Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
s10_e01_c03_u240	Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
s10_e01_c03_u241	Well, I'm so excited about this.
s10_e01_c03_u242	Really? Excited?
s10_e01_c03_u243	Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
s10_e01_c03_u244	Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?
s10_e01_c03_u245	I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
s10_e01_c03_u246	Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
s10_e01_c03_u247	Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
s10_e01_c04_u248	Hi, Mike's place.
s10_e01_c04_u249	Hey, it's Mike.
s10_e01_c04_u250	Ooh, that was fast.
s10_e01_c04_u251	Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
s10_e01_c04_u252	Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
s10_e01_c04_u253	One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
s10_e01_c04_u254	Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
s10_e01_c04_u255	Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
s10_e01_c04_u256	Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)
s10_e01_c04_u257	Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
s10_e01_c04_u258	(stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.
s10_e01_c04_u259	Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
s10_e01_c04_u260	Enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)
s10_e01_c05_u261	Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!
s10_e01_c05_u262	You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
s10_e01_c05_u263	Yeah!
s10_e01_c05_u264	So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
s10_e01_c05_u265	Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)
s10_e01_c05_u266	What are you singing?
s10_e01_c05_u267	It's "Bolero" from "10".
s10_e01_c05_u268	It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
s10_e01_c05_u269	You what? You said you liked them.
s10_e01_c05_u270	Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
s10_e01_c05_u271	Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
s10_e01_c05_u272	Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
s10_e01_c05_u273	You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!
s10_e01_c05_u274	Hit yourself in the tooth?
s10_e01_c05_u275	And the eye!
s10_e01_c06_u276	(gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)
s10_e01_c06_u277	That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
s10_e01_c06_u278	Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
s10_e01_c06_u279	Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
s10_e01_c06_u280	(unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!
s10_e01_c06_u281	Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
s10_e01_c06_u282	(gasps) OH NO!
s10_e01_c06_u283	What? What is it?
s10_e01_c06_u284	Oh, major shampoo explosion!
s10_e01_c06_u285	Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
s10_e01_c06_u286	Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? (looks up)
s10_e01_c06_u287	Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
s10_e01_c06_u288	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
s10_e01_c06_u289	Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
s10_e01_c06_u290	Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
s10_e01_c06_u291	Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
s10_e01_c06_u292	Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)
s10_e01_c07_u293	Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
s10_e01_c07_u294	I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
s10_e01_c07_u295	Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
s10_e01_c07_u296	My name is Precious.
s10_e01_c07_u297	Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
s10_e01_c07_u298	I just can't believe this... Why?
s10_e01_c07_u299	Well, I don't...
s10_e01_c07_u300	Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
s10_e01_c07_u301	Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
s10_e01_c07_u302	I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
s10_e01_c07_u303	Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
s10_e01_c07_u304	I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
s10_e01_c07_u305	But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
s10_e01_c07_u306	He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever. (she starts to cry again)
s10_e01_c07_u307	Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
s10_e01_c07_u308	Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
s10_e01_c07_u309	Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.
s10_e01_c07_u310	You're welcome!
s10_e01_c08_u311	Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
s10_e01_c08_u312	Not really.
s10_e01_c08_u313	I have a problem.
s10_e01_c08_u314	Really? What happened?
s10_e01_c08_u315	Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
s10_e01_c08_u316	You can't move at all?
s10_e01_c08_u317	Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)
s10_e01_c08_u318	If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
s10_e01_c08_u319	(looking disappointed) I guess so...
s10_e01_c08_u320	(trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.
s10_e01_c08_u321	Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
s10_e01_c09_u322	Hey!
s10_e01_c09_u323	Hi!
s10_e01_c09_u324	So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
s10_e01_c09_u325	Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
s10_e01_c09_u326	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)
s10_e01_c09_u327	Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
s10_e01_c09_u328	Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
s10_e01_c09_u329	Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
s10_e01_c09_u330	I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
s10_e01_c09_u331	No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
s10_e01_c09_u332	Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)
s10_e01_c09_u333	Goo--ood night!
s10_e01_c09_u334	Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)
s10_e01_c09_u335	Seriously, good night!
s10_e01_c09_u336	Stop saying good night.
s10_e01_c09_u337	Okay.
s10_e01_c10_u338	Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...
s10_e01_c10_u339	Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
s10_e01_c10_u340	Sure, what do you have in mind?
s10_e01_c10_u341	I think you know.
s10_e01_c10_u342	Really? I don't really feel like it.
s10_e01_c10_u343	This is what I want to do.
s10_e01_c10_u344	Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
s10_e01_c10_u345	(Picks up the "Miss Congeniality" DVD) She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
s05_e10_c01_u001	What are you doing?
s05_e10_c01_u002	I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. (There's nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (There's one lone tomato.) And top shelf: expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)
s05_e10_c01_u003	Why are you doing this?
s05_e10_c01_u004	Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
s05_e10_c01_u005	Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
s05_e10_c01_u006	Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
s05_e10_c01_u007	Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little confused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here-sit down. (Ross sits down.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
s05_e10_c01_u008	So what, we just sit?
s05_e10_c01_u009	Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and hits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)
s05_e10_c01_u010	(Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.
s05_e10_c01_u011	(In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
s05_e10_c01_u012	(Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and Joey laugh silently.) It's been six months! It's not funny!
s05_e10_c01_u013	But, I love you.
s05_e10_c01_u014	Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!! (Joey hangs up.)
s05_e10_c01_u015	And that's Wednesday. (He reclines in his chair.) Ohh.
s05_e10_c02_u016	Hey you guys, guess what?
s05_e10_c02_u017	The British are coming?
s05_e10_c02_u018	Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.) Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
s05_e10_c02_u019	(Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
s05_e10_c02_u020	Ohh.
s05_e10_c02_u021	Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
s05_e10_c02_u022	You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. (Chandler laughs.)
s05_e10_c02_u023	So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
s05_e10_c02_u024	Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.
s05_e10_c02_u025	Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. (He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
s05_e10_c02_u026	Hey guys.
s05_e10_c02_u027	Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
s05_e10_c02_u028	Thanks, Mon.
s05_e10_c02_u029	Well, of course.
s05_e10_c02_u030	Do you want to go out on a date with her?
s05_e10_c02_u031	Monica!!!
s05_e10_c02_u032	(Looking at Monica) Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
s05_e10_c02_u033	Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
s05_e10_c02_u034	(To Monica) On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? (To Rachel) See ya Friday. (He walks out.)
s05_e10_c02_u035	(Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.
s05_e10_c03_u036	How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
s05_e10_c03_u037	She's a woman!
s05_e10_c03_u038	(Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?
s05_e10_c04_u039	Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put some change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up and down as if she is spreading joy.)
s05_e10_c04_u040	(Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!
s05_e10_c04_u041	Hey!
s05_e10_c04_u042	I just wanted to see how it's going.
s05_e10_c04_u043	Well, it's going okay.
s05_e10_c04_u044	(Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out.
s05_e10_c04_u045	Oh, thanks!
s05_e10_c04_u046	Yeah!
s05_e10_c04_u047	Wow!
s05_e10_c04_u048	Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
s05_e10_c04_u049	Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)
s05_e10_c04_u050	Just get your nails done?
s05_e10_c04_u051	Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her change purse into the bucket.)
s05_e10_c04_u052	Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and spreads her joy.)
s05_e10_c04_u053	Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
s05_e10_c04_u054	Wait, you can't take the money out.
s05_e10_c04_u055	I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
s05_e10_c04_u056	But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
s05_e10_c04_u057	I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
s05_e10_c04_u058	Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still
s05_e10_c04_u059	Bite me, blondie! (The man storms off.)
s05_e10_c04_u060	Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just- (She scowls at him.)
s05_e10_c05_u061	That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
s05_e10_c05_u062	I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
s05_e10_c05_u063	Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
s05_e10_c05_u064	Wait a second, I could star in it!
s05_e10_c05_u065	Or that.
s05_e10_c05_u066	I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
s05_e10_c05_u067	I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
s05_e10_c05_u068	Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
s05_e10_c05_u069	Yeah!
s05_e10_c05_u070	Thanks!
s05_e10_c05_u071	(grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
s05_e10_c05_u072	Done!
s05_e10_c05_u073	And it can't be Joey.
s05_e10_c05_u074	It's not.
s05_e10_c05_u075	Or Joseph.
s05_e10_c05_u076	(disappointed) Oh.
s05_e10_c06_u077	Hey, what's up?
s05_e10_c06_u078	I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
s05_e10_c06_u079	Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
s05_e10_c06_u080	Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
s05_e10_c06_u081	You had no relationship!!
s05_e10_c06_u082	No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
s05_e10_c06_u083	Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
s05_e10_c06_u084	She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
s05_e10_c06_u085	Come on, hurry!
s05_e10_c07_u086	Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
s05_e10_c07_u087	Why?
s05_e10_c07_u088	Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
s05_e10_c07_u089	Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
s05_e10_c07_u090	You're driving me crazy with that!
s05_e10_c07_u091	Okay, I'll stop.
s05_e10_c07_u092	Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
s05_e10_c07_u093	Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
s05_e10_c07_u094	You wanna play?
s05_e10_c07_u095	Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
s05_e10_c07_u096	Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
s05_e10_c07_u097	(jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
s05_e10_c07_u098	I'm intrigued.
s05_e10_c07_u099	All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
s05_e10_c07_u100	Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
s05_e10_c07_u101	Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
s05_e10_c07_u102	Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
s05_e10_c07_u103	Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the door.)
s05_e10_c08_u104	Thank you, Happy Holidays.
s05_e10_c08_u105	Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't- (The lady ignores her and walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
s05_e10_c08_u106	Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that. (She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!
s05_e10_c09_u107	All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! (Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The official rulebook of Fireball.
s05_e10_c09_u108	Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
s05_e10_c09_u109	(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
s05_e10_c09_u110	This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
s05_e10_c09_u111	You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
s05_e10_c09_u112	(To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. (To Joey) Now come on!
s05_e10_c09_u113	Hey!
s05_e10_c09_u114	No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! (After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)
s05_e10_c10_u115	I had a really nice time tonight.
s05_e10_c10_u116	So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
s05_e10_c10_u117	I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
s05_e10_c10_u118	You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods, "Yes.") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
s05_e10_c10_u119	Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
s05_e10_c10_u120	Hi!
s05_e10_c10_u121	Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
s05_e10_c10_u122	Like it would help.
s05_e10_c10_u123	You are so bad! (Hits him softly.)
s05_e10_c10_u124	You are! (Hits her back.)
s05_e10_c10_u125	You are! (Hits him softly.)
s05_e10_c10_u126	You are! (Hits her back.)
s05_e10_c10_u127	You are! (Hits him softly.)
s05_e10_c10_u128	You are! (Hits her back.)
s05_e10_c10_u129	You are! (Hits him harder this time.)
s05_e10_c10_u130	You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
s05_e10_c10_u131	(not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue to ignore her.)
s05_e10_c11_u132	Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
s05_e10_c11_u133	No.
s05_e10_c11_u134	Does it look like an ashtray?
s05_e10_c11_u135	No.
s05_e10_c11_u136	Does it look like a urinal?
s05_e10_c11_u137	Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)
s05_e10_c11_u138	So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
s05_e10_c11_u139	Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
s05_e10_c11_u140	Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
s05_e10_c11_u141	Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)
s05_e10_c11_u142	(entering from her room) Hey!
s05_e10_c11_u143	Hey!
s05_e10_c11_u144	Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
s05_e10_c11_u145	Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
s05_e10_c11_u146	Oh-oh, yeah.
s05_e10_c11_u147	All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
s05_e10_c11_u148	Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
s05_e10_c11_u149	Still, I was quick as a cat.
s05_e10_c11_u150	Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
s05_e10_c11_u151	Oh, you're kidding.
s05_e10_c11_u152	Yeah, they were very y'know-wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
s05_e10_c11_u153	(laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.
s05_e10_c11_u154	Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
s05_e10_c11_u155	Too strong for me?
s05_e10_c11_u156	Yeah.
s05_e10_c11_u157	You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
s05_e10_c11_u158	Oh fine.
s05_e10_c11_u159	Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start wrestling.)
s05_e10_c11_u160	Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. (She leaves them to wrestle.)
s05_e10_c12_u161	(entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
s05_e10_c12_u162	Joey's not going.
s05_e10_c12_u163	(To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.
s05_e10_c12_u164	Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
s05_e10_c12_u165	Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
s05_e10_c12_u166	Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
s05_e10_c12_u167	(To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
s05_e10_c12_u168	I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
s05_e10_c12_u169	Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
s05_e10_c12_u170	The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
s05_e10_c12_u171	I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
s05_e10_c12_u172	Come on look guys, don't fight.
s05_e10_c12_u173	And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
s05_e10_c12_u174	Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
s05_e10_c12_u175	If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
s05_e10_c12_u176	Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
s05_e10_c12_u177	How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
s05_e10_c12_u178	I paid for those tickets!
s05_e10_c12_u179	No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
s05_e10_c12_u180	Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
s05_e10_c13_u181	so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here (His sister) forgets the camera!
s05_e10_c13_u182	Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
s05_e10_c13_u183	When did that happen to you?!
s05_e10_c13_u184	Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
s05_e10_c13_u185	Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
s05_e10_c13_u186	Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (She takes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does it again. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of it and some filling falls into his lap.)
s05_e10_c13_u187	Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
s05_e10_c13_u188	Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. The thing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his crotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)
s05_e10_c13_u189	We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
s05_e10_c13_u190	Yep. (To Rachel) I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
s05_e10_c13_u191	Oh, great!
s05_e10_c13_u192	Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!
s05_e10_c13_u193	That was unbelievable!
s05_e10_c13_u194	Okay, see? I told you!
s05_e10_c13_u195	Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
s05_e10_c13_u196	I don't believe they're brother and sister.
s05_e10_c13_u197	They're brother and sister!!!
s05_e10_c14_u198	Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. (The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)
s05_e10_c14_u199	Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought I told you to get outta here!
s05_e10_c14_u200	Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
s05_e10_c14_u201	What?!
s05_e10_c14_u202	Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
s05_e10_c14_u203	That chick can't handle my corner.
s05_e10_c14_u204	Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
s05_e10_c14_u205	Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.) (The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. (The old lady.)
s05_e10_c15_u206	Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
s05_e10_c15_u207	Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
s05_e10_c15_u208	What?! Why?!
s05_e10_c15_u209	Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
s05_e10_c15_u210	Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
s05_e10_c15_u211	Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's
s05_e10_c15_u212	Do-do you, do you have brothers?
s05_e10_c15_u213	No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
s05_e10_c15_u214	Are you close with them?
s05_e10_c15_u215	No-no, they're not very nice people.
s05_e10_c15_u216	Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
s05_e10_c15_u217	Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of
s05_e10_c15_u218	(calling from the bathroom) Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
s05_e10_c15_u219	(seeing Rachel's shocked look) What?
s05_e10_c15_u220	Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)
s05_e10_c16_u221	Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
s05_e10_c16_u222	Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
s05_e10_c16_u223	(entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
s05_e10_c16_u224	Yay!
s05_e10_c16_u225	Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!
s05_e10_c16_u226	No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
s05_e10_c16_u227	I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
s05_e10_c16_u228	Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
s05_e10_c16_u229	Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
s05_e10_c16_u230	All right. (Takes a copy.)
s05_e10_c16_u231	All right. (Takes another copy.)
s05_e10_c16_u232	Okay. (Reading.) "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross (Points to him.)
s05_e10_c16_u233	Hey man.
s05_e10_c16_u234	What is up?
s05_e10_c16_u235	About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
s05_e10_c16_u236	No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
s05_e10_c16_u237	Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest- (Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
s05_e10_c16_u238	Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
s05_e10_c16_u239	I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.
s05_e10_c16_u240	(To Ross) I'm sorry too.
s05_e10_c16_u241	Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
s05_e10_c16_u242	(reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.
s05_e10_c16_u243	I am sorry, Ross.
s05_e10_c16_u244	A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well you co-created Fireball. The end.
s05_e10_c16_u245	This took you all day?!
s05_e10_c16_u246	No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!
s05_e10_c17_u247	(Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
s05_e10_c17_u248	Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
s05_e10_c17_u249	I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
s05_e10_c17_u250	It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
s05_e10_c17_u251	Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
s05_e10_c17_u252	This is disgusting!
s05_e10_c17_u253	I'm not reading this!
s05_e10_c17_u254	What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
s10_e12_c01_u001	Oh, hey Joey.
s10_e12_c01_u002	Uh, hey.
s10_e12_c01_u003	Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
s10_e12_c01_u004	(afraid) Yeah.
s10_e12_c01_u005	Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
s10_e12_c01_u006	So he can't come?
s10_e12_c01_u007	No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
s10_e12_c01_u008	Seriously?
s10_e12_c01_u009	Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
s10_e12_c01_u010	I am pretty wisdomous.
s10_e12_c01_u011	So... what do you say?
s10_e12_c01_u012	Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored. (they hug)
s10_e12_c01_u013	Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
s10_e12_c01_u014	(takes her hand) Listen, I hope... that you know... (has difficulty saying it) I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
s10_e12_c02_u015	Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
s10_e12_c02_u016	(her mobile phone rings) Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! (she answers) Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
s10_e12_c02_u017	(she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone) Well, it matters to me!
s10_e12_c02_u018	Well, I don't care, so you pick!
s10_e12_c02_u019	Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
s10_e12_c02_u020	Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
s10_e12_c02_u021	You don't know military time?
s10_e12_c02_u022	Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
s10_e12_c02_u023	Just subtract twelve.
s10_e12_c02_u024	Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
s10_e12_c02_u025	(screaming) Six o'clock!
s10_e12_c02_u026	Ok.
s10_e12_c02_u027	Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
s10_e12_c02_u028	Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
s10_e12_c02_u029	Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
s10_e12_c02_u030	What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
s10_e12_c02_u031	Ooh... she backed out.
s10_e12_c02_u032	She did? Why?
s10_e12_c02_u033	I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
s10_e12_c02_u034	(looking angry) Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
s10_e12_c03_u035	Hey!
s10_e12_c03_u036	Hey!
s10_e12_c03_u037	You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
s10_e12_c03_u038	Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
s10_e12_c03_u039	No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
s10_e12_c03_u040	Rehearse it!
s10_e12_c03_u041	Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)
s10_e12_c03_u042	Thanks for coming you guys.
s10_e12_c03_u043	Oh, (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
s10_e12_c03_u044	Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
s10_e12_c03_u045	That is why!
s10_e12_c03_u046	Yeah.
s10_e12_c03_u047	So Rach.
s10_e12_c03_u048	Yeah.
s10_e12_c03_u049	Where is Emma?
s10_e12_c03_u050	Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
s10_e12_c03_u051	(coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)
s10_e12_c03_u052	Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
s10_e12_c03_u053	Yes, we are.
s10_e12_c03_u054	Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
s10_e12_c03_u055	How's that?
s10_e12_c03_u056	You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
s10_e12_c03_u057	Who in God's name are you?
s10_e12_c03_u058	Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
s10_e12_c03_u059	(to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
s10_e12_c03_u060	Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
s10_e12_c03_u061	Uh... November?
s10_e12_c03_u062	I wanna say it's not looking good.
s10_e12_c03_u063	Hey Pheebs...
s10_e12_c03_u064	What's up?
s10_e12_c03_u065	Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
s10_e12_c03_u066	Heh.
s10_e12_c03_u067	Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
s10_e12_c03_u068	What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)
s10_e12_c03_u069	Well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!
s10_e12_c03_u070	I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
s10_e12_c03_u071	Oh, man!
s10_e12_c03_u072	This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!
s10_e12_c03_u073	FOOTBALL!
s10_e12_c03_u074	Thank you.
s10_e12_c03_u075	(looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
s10_e12_c03_u076	Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
s10_e12_c03_u077	Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
s10_e12_c03_u078	I don't have a fax machine.
s10_e12_c03_u079	Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
s10_e12_c03_u080	I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
s10_e12_c03_u081	I know, I hate being left out of things.
s10_e12_c03_u082	And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
s10_e12_c03_u083	Hey guys, how is it going?
s10_e12_c03_u084	Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
s10_e12_c03_u085	Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
s10_e12_c03_u086	What happened?
s10_e12_c03_u087	Who cares, AND?
s10_e12_c03_u088	...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys... (Ross stands up)
s10_e12_c03_u089	I'll do it!
s10_e12_c03_u090	(standing up too) M-Me-me-me!
s10_e12_c03_u091	You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
s10_e12_c03_u092	Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
s10_e12_c03_u093	No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?
s10_e12_c03_u094	You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose. (he leaves)
s10_e12_c03_u095	(to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
s10_e12_c03_u096	Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
s10_e12_c03_u097	Please, you're going down!
s10_e12_c03_u098	You are going downer!
s10_e12_c03_u099	Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
s10_e12_c03_u100	(almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)
s10_e12_c04_u101	So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
s10_e12_c04_u102	Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
s10_e12_c04_u103	Oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
s10_e12_c04_u104	I intend to marry her.
s10_e12_c04_u105	Oh, a wiseacre. (Mike looks bewildered). No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
s10_e12_c04_u106	No more so than acting.
s10_e12_c04_u107	Strike two!
s10_e12_c04_u108	You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
s10_e12_c04_u109	Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!
s10_e12_c04_u110	So, what did you decide?
s10_e12_c04_u111	I decided to pee.
s10_e12_c04_u112	Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
s10_e12_c04_u113	Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
s10_e12_c04_u114	Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
s10_e12_c04_u115	Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
s10_e12_c04_u116	(excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody, what is it!
s10_e12_c04_u117	Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
s10_e12_c04_u118	What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
s10_e12_c04_u119	All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
s10_e12_c04_u120	I'll do it! (Monica approaches)
s10_e12_c04_u121	Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)
s10_e12_c04_u122	Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
s10_e12_c04_u123	You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
s10_e12_c04_u124	Is that what you say to Chandler?
s10_e12_c04_u125	(very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)
s10_e12_c04_u126	Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
s10_e12_c04_u127	And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.
s10_e12_c04_u128	What?
s10_e12_c04_u129	YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)
s10_e12_c05_u130	Hey!
s10_e12_c05_u131	Happy wedding day!
s10_e12_c05_u132	Oh, happy my wedding day to you!
s10_e12_c05_u133	Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
s10_e12_c05_u134	Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
s10_e12_c05_u135	Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
s10_e12_c05_u136	Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
s10_e12_c05_u137	Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)
s10_e12_c05_u138	Wow, this is a lot!
s10_e12_c05_u139	Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
s10_e12_c05_u140	You won awards?
s10_e12_c05_u141	Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
s10_e12_c05_u142	Hey!
s10_e12_c05_u143	Hi.
s10_e12_c05_u144	Where's Rach?
s10_e12_c05_u145	She's in her room, why?
s10_e12_c05_u146	I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
s10_e12_c05_u147	What d'you want?
s10_e12_c05_u148	You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
s10_e12_c05_u149	Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
s10_e12_c05_u150	I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
s10_e12_c05_u151	Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
s10_e12_c05_u152	Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
s10_e12_c05_u153	Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
s10_e12_c05_u154	(waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES, YES!
s10_e12_c06_u155	Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
s10_e12_c06_u156	I know.
s10_e12_c06_u157	Hey.
s10_e12_c06_u158	Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
s10_e12_c06_u159	(thinks a moment) Orchids?
s10_e12_c06_u160	Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
s10_e12_c06_u161	(to Mike) Hello Michael.
s10_e12_c06_u162	Joseph.
s10_e12_c06_u163	May I have a word with you, please?
s10_e12_c06_u164	(looking around the room) This is... great...
s10_e12_c06_u165	Have a seat. (Mike sits on his bed, and Joey towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) I cannot allow this.
s10_e12_c06_u166	(not amused) Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
s10_e12_c06_u167	More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."
s10_e12_c06_u168	Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
s10_e12_c06_u169	I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
s10_e12_c06_u170	(gets up) Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
s10_e12_c06_u171	(very satisfied and smiling) That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
s10_e12_c06_u172	That must have been one lousy movie.
s10_e12_c06_u173	(almost crying) That was ME!
s10_e12_c07_u174	Hi
s10_e12_c07_u175	Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
s10_e12_c07_u176	Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
s10_e12_c07_u177	Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
s10_e12_c07_u178	All right fine, I pick you.
s10_e12_c07_u179	(Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
s10_e12_c07_u180	(not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...
s10_e12_c08_u181	No! We're gonna do it my way. (listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. (switches calls) Hello?
s10_e12_c08_u182	I'm glad we had this little talk.
s10_e12_c08_u183	Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. (walks away) That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
s10_e12_c08_u184	Okay.
s10_e12_c08_u185	Bye.
s10_e12_c08_u186	Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
s10_e12_c08_u187	Oh my God, what's it doing here?
s10_e12_c08_u188	(Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) Uh! What a pickle.
s10_e12_c08_u189	(starting to panic) Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
s10_e12_c08_u190	(staring at the ice sculpture) How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (They all glare at him)
s10_e12_c09_u191	How's it going?
s10_e12_c09_u192	(smiling to himself) Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
s10_e12_c09_u193	(smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.
s10_e12_c09_u194	(barely containing himself at this point) Well, you have fun tonight.
s10_e12_c09_u195	You too.
s10_e12_c09_u196	Oh, I will.
s10_e12_c09_u197	Me too.
s10_e12_c09_u198	Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
s10_e12_c09_u199	I'm not supposed to tell you.
s10_e12_c09_u200	I'm not supposed to tell you!
s10_e12_c09_u201	You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)
s10_e12_c09_u202	Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
s10_e12_c09_u203	Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)
s10_e12_c09_u204	Rach, Rach, knock knock.
s10_e12_c09_u205	Who's there?
s10_e12_c09_u206	I'll tell you at the wedding.
s10_e12_c09_u207	Uh.
s10_e12_c09_u208	Hey, I forgot my scarf.
s10_e12_c09_u209	You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
s10_e12_c09_u210	Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
s10_e12_c09_u211	What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
s10_e12_c09_u212	(sarcastic) Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
s10_e12_c09_u213	Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
s10_e12_c09_u214	(enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going?
s10_e12_c09_u215	(to Monica) Help me.
s10_e12_c09_u216	What?
s10_e12_c09_u217	I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
s10_e12_c09_u218	(Sounds moved) Really?
s10_e12_c09_u219	(Nearly in tears) Please?
s10_e12_c09_u220	You really want me to come back?
s10_e12_c09_u221	More than I wanna get married.
s10_e12_c09_u222	Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
s10_e12_c09_u223	Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
s10_e12_c09_u224	(sounds scared already) About what?
s10_e12_c09_u225	The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)
s10_e12_c09_u226	Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
s10_e12_c09_u227	I don't think they are.
s10_e12_c09_u228	(to Rachel) Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs.
s10_e12_c10_u229	(Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost it's power.
s10_e12_c10_u230	Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
s10_e12_c10_u231	Since when do you watch the news?
s10_e12_c10_u232	Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
s10_e12_c10_u233	(To Phoebe and Mike) I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
s10_e12_c10_u234	I know.
s10_e12_c10_u235	Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
s10_e12_c10_u236	What?
s10_e12_c10_u237	Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
s10_e12_c10_u238	(Turning to Mike) What do you think?
s10_e12_c10_u239	I think I wanna get married to you today.
s10_e12_c10_u240	Me too! (turning to Monica) Monica, do you think we could do it?
s10_e12_c10_u241	(thinking) AFFIRMATIVE!
s10_e12_c11_u242	(walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)
s10_e12_c11_u243	Michael!
s10_e12_c11_u244	Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! (kisses his dad) Hi! (kisses his mom) Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...
s10_e12_c11_u245	No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
s10_e12_c11_u246	(leans in towards Mike) I crushed a pill and put it in her drink... (to his wife) Come on, sweetheart.
s10_e12_c11_u247	(to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
s10_e12_c11_u248	So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
s10_e12_c11_u249	I guess.
s10_e12_c11_u250	I'll do it!
s10_e12_c11_u251	No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
s10_e12_c11_u252	I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
s10_e12_c11_u253	(takes Chappy from Mike) Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!
s10_e12_c11_u254	Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
s10_e12_c11_u255	Oh, no!
s10_e12_c11_u256	Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
s10_e12_c11_u257	Really?
s10_e12_c11_u258	Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
s10_e12_c11_u259	Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
s10_e12_c11_u260	I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
s10_e12_c11_u261	Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
s10_e12_c11_u262	(quickly) I'll do it.
s10_e12_c11_u263	I'll...
s10_e12_c11_u264	(to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah...
s10_e12_c11_u265	Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me. (they walk off, Ross looks down to Chappy, who he's holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. He is clearly disgusted by it.)
s10_e12_c11_u266	Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
s10_e12_c11_u267	Oh, okay. Hi new dad. (Chandler waves)
s10_e12_c11_u268	So, you're ready to do this?
s10_e12_c11_u269	Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
s10_e12_c11_u270	Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)
s10_e12_c11_u271	Oh, thank you.
s10_e12_c11_u272	I love you. (Phoebe leans in to kiss her.) Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. (the girls hug)
s10_e12_c11_u273	I love you guys.
s10_e12_c11_u274	I love you.
s10_e12_c11_u275	Okay. (in her microphone) It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's get this bad boy on the road.
s10_e12_c11_u276	(to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
s10_e12_c11_u277	(checking her clipboard) I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
s10_e12_c11_u278	Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
s10_e12_c11_u279	Okay Marjorie, hit it.
s10_e12_c11_u280	Geez Ross, you could have showered.
s10_e12_c11_u281	It's the dog.
s10_e12_c11_u282	Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me.
s10_e12_c11_u283	Ready?
s10_e12_c11_u284	(nervously) Okay.
s10_e12_c11_u285	Okay.
s10_e12_c11_u286	Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
s10_e12_c11_u287	Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
s10_e12_c11_u288	I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
s10_e12_c11_u289	You look beautiful.
s10_e12_c11_u290	Thank you.
s10_e12_c11_u291	My God! Aren't you freezing?
s10_e12_c11_u292	Na-ah.
s10_e12_c11_u293	Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
s10_e12_c11_u294	(whispering to Phoebe) Okay...
s10_e12_c11_u295	When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)
s10_e12_c11_u296	Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever. (He puts the ring on Phoebe's finger.)
s10_e12_c11_u297	Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
s10_e12_c11_u298	I love you too.
s10_e12_c11_u299	Uh Joey...
s10_e12_c11_u300	Yeah?
s10_e12_c11_u301	Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
s10_e12_c11_u302	Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
s10_e12_c11_u303	I do.
s10_e12_c11_u304	Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
s10_e12_c11_u305	I do.
s10_e12_c11_u306	I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
s10_e12_c11_u307	I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
s10_e12_c12_u308	That really was an incredible wedding.
s10_e12_c12_u309	It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
s10_e12_c12_u310	I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
s10_e12_c12_u311	Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
s10_e12_c12_u312	I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
s10_e12_c12_u313	Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
s04_e10_c01_u001	Hey!
s04_e10_c01_u002	Hey!
s04_e10_c01_u003	I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?
s04_e10_c01_u004	Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious mouth full, nods yes.)
s04_e10_c01_u005	15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles, no!)
s04_e10_c01_u006	Where were you?
s04_e10_c01_u007	Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
s04_e10_c01_u008	Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
s04_e10_c01_u009	Oh, which museum?
s04_e10_c01_u010	(just Phoebe) No, answer his.
s04_e10_c01_u011	Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
s04_e10_c01_u012	Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
s04_e10_c01_u013	No, I'm getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
s04_e10_c01_u014	How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) That joke would've killed in Albany.
s04_e10_c01_u015	Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)
s04_e10_c02_u016	Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
s04_e10_c02_u017	Umm, that paper's two weeks old.
s04_e10_c02_u018	All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.
s04_e10_c02_u019	Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in) Y'know, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.
s04_e10_c02_u020	Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
s04_e10_c02_u021	Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
s04_e10_c02_u022	Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
s04_e10_c02_u023	Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
s04_e10_c02_u024	Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
s04_e10_c02_u025	Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
s04_e10_c02_u026	Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.
s04_e10_c02_u027	Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
s04_e10_c02_u028	Hey!
s04_e10_c02_u029	What's wrong Mon?
s04_e10_c02_u030	Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
s04_e10_c02_u031	Oh.
s04_e10_c02_u032	I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef's hat. (The hat says Quit, bitch')
s04_e10_c02_u033	Hey, maybe they meant to write, Quiet, bitch.'
s04_e10_c02_u034	Hey, honey! What's the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
s04_e10_c02_u035	I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.)
s04_e10_c02_u036	Ohhh!
s04_e10_c02_u037	I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
s04_e10_c02_u038	Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
s04_e10_c02_u039	I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
s04_e10_c02_u040	Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.
s04_e10_c02_u041	Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
s04_e10_c02_u042	That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
s04_e10_c02_u043	Good enough to get fired.
s04_e10_c02_u044	All right, you're hired!
s04_e10_c02_u045	Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
s04_e10_c02_u046	(he glares at him for a while) Yes.
s04_e10_c03_u047	I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm- I mean- No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
s04_e10_c03_u048	I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
s04_e10_c03_u049	See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
s04_e10_c03_u050	Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious.
s04_e10_c03_u051	Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
s04_e10_c03_u052	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
s04_e10_c03_u053	(to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
s04_e10_c03_u054	Oh wow! I'm free for her!
s04_e10_c03_u055	Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!
s04_e10_c03_u056	Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
s04_e10_c03_u057	Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
s04_e10_c03_u058	Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
s04_e10_c03_u059	Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
s04_e10_c03_u060	Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!
s04_e10_c04_u061	Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
s04_e10_c04_u062	(singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!
s04_e10_c04_u063	Pheebs, that's great!
s04_e10_c04_u064	Oh, yay!
s04_e10_c04_u065	But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.
s04_e10_c04_u066	I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
s04_e10_c04_u067	What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
s04_e10_c04_u068	All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
s04_e10_c04_u069	Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
s04_e10_c04_u070	Oh yeah!
s04_e10_c04_u071	Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?
s04_e10_c04_u072	(entering) Hello, children!
s04_e10_c04_u073	Hey!
s04_e10_c04_u074	(to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!
s04_e10_c04_u075	Really?!
s04_e10_c04_u076	Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! (to Joey) Knicks tonight?
s04_e10_c04_u077	Sure! Where are the seats?
s04_e10_c04_u078	Wherever! I've got like 20!
s04_e10_c04_u079	So, will I like any of these guys?
s04_e10_c04_u080	Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more.
s04_e10_c04_u081	Chandler!
s04_e10_c04_u082	Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
s04_e10_c04_u083	(shocked) You work with robots!!
s04_e10_c04_u084	(pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer.
s04_e10_c04_u085	Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!
s04_e10_c04_u086	Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
s04_e10_c04_u087	Op, I like credit cards!
s04_e10_c04_u088	See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
s04_e10_c04_u089	Well, so what does he do?
s04_e10_c04_u090	Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
s04_e10_c04_u091	Your company has a fine foods division?
s04_e10_c04_u092	It's a big company, I don't-if you-I
s04_e10_c04_u093	Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
s04_e10_c04_u094	No! No, the robots just work for them.
s04_e10_c04_u095	(getting up) All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
s04_e10_c04_u096	Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
s04_e10_c04_u097	You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
s04_e10_c04_u098	Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
s04_e10_c04_u099	You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you.
s04_e10_c05_u100	Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
s04_e10_c05_u101	Oh yeah! With who?
s04_e10_c05_u102	You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
s04_e10_c05_u103	Yeah.
s04_e10_c05_u104	Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.
s04_e10_c05_u105	If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
s04_e10_c05_u106	Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.
s04_e10_c05_u107	(entering) Hey!
s04_e10_c05_u108	Hey!
s04_e10_c05_u109	Hey, man!
s04_e10_c05_u110	Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
s04_e10_c05_u111	(checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)
s04_e10_c06_u112	(entering from the dining room) Hey.
s04_e10_c06_u113	Hey.
s04_e10_c06_u114	Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket? (sees there's a burn spot on it)
s04_e10_c06_u115	They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.
s04_e10_c06_u116	You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)
s04_e10_c06_u117	What are you doing?!
s04_e10_c06_u118	It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
s04_e10_c06_u119	Thanks. (Joey's still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!
s04_e10_c07_u120	(entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
s04_e10_c07_u121	Well, like father, like son.
s04_e10_c07_u122	Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
s04_e10_c07_u123	Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
s04_e10_c07_u124	Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn't tell him that, though? Right?
s04_e10_c07_u125	Ummmmmmmm, no.
s04_e10_c07_u126	You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
s04_e10_c07_u127	Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
s04_e10_c07_u128	Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
s04_e10_c08_u129	Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
s04_e10_c08_u130	Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
s04_e10_c08_u131	(entering) Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday. (hands him two envelopes)
s04_e10_c08_u132	(opening an envelope) There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
s04_e10_c08_u133	Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
s04_e10_c08_u134	Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?
s04_e10_c08_u135	Because we can remember them.
s04_e10_c08_u136	Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
s04_e10_c08_u137	Well, sure, that too.
s04_e10_c08_u138	Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere
s04_e10_c08_u139	Can't hear you!
s04_e10_c08_u140	(louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at the money he's holding, and doesn't speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
s04_e10_c08_u141	No ma'am.
s04_e10_c08_u142	Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)
s04_e10_c09_u143	What the hell happened?!
s04_e10_c09_u144	I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It's been a long time since I had- (tries to do the math in his head, but can't) 327 + 238 dollars!"
s04_e10_c09_u145	Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!
s04_e10_c09_u146	And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
s04_e10_c09_u147	What kinda things have you been saying?
s04_e10_c09_u148	Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
s04_e10_c10_u149	(singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry
s04_e10_c10_u150	(interrupting) Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
s04_e10_c10_u151	What?
s04_e10_c10_u152	I'm not Jewish, so
s04_e10_c10_u153	So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which wakes up Ross with a start.)
s04_e10_c10_u154	Bad dream?
s04_e10_c10_u155	I wasn't sleeping.
s04_e10_c10_u156	Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
s04_e10_c10_u157	The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.
s04_e10_c10_u158	So, did you pick one yet?
s04_e10_c10_u159	No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.
s04_e10_c10_u160	Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
s04_e10_c10_u161	Y'know, you're right. Thank you.
s04_e10_c10_u162	Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
s04_e10_c10_u163	Prague?
s04_e10_c10_u164	There's sooo much you don't know.
s04_e10_c11_u165	Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
s04_e10_c11_u166	I did! I absolutely did!
s04_e10_c11_u167	You idiot!!
s04_e10_c11_u168	I'm sure you're right, but why?
s04_e10_c11_u169	You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
s04_e10_c11_u170	Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
s04_e10_c11_u171	Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
s04_e10_c11_u172	I know! I know!
s04_e10_c11_u173	Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)
s04_e10_c11_u174	Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)
s04_e10_c11_u175	Really?
s04_e10_c11_u176	Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
s04_e10_c11_u177	No.
s04_e10_c11_u178	Oh, it doesn't matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
s04_e10_c11_u179	Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
s04_e10_c11_u180	Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
s04_e10_c11_u181	Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)
s04_e10_c11_u182	Have you ever been with a woman?
s04_e10_c11_u183	What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
s04_e10_c11_u184	So there is no good time to ask that question.
s04_e10_c12_u185	The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
s04_e10_c13_u186	I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me some more swordfish?
s04_e10_c13_u187	I don't speak English.
s04_e10_c13_u188	You did a minute ago!
s04_e10_c13_u189	Well, I don't know what to tell ya!
s04_e10_c13_u190	Fine!
s04_e10_c13_u191	Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! (She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door opens)
s04_e10_c13_u192	You found that handle, did ya?
s04_e10_c13_u193	That's not funny.
s04_e10_c13_u194	Well that's not true.
s04_e10_c13_u195	(starting to cry) I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is
s04_e10_c13_u196	(interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
s04_e10_c13_u197	You do?
s04_e10_c13_u198	You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all.
s04_e10_c13_u199	Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
s04_e10_c13_u200	What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
s04_e10_c13_u201	You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
s04_e10_c13_u202	No.
s04_e10_c13_u203	How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
s04_e10_c13_u204	No, it's really good.
s04_e10_c13_u205	Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!
s04_e10_c14_u206	Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
s04_e10_c14_u207	(waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)
s04_e10_c14_u208	I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
s04_e10_c14_u209	What?
s04_e10_c14_u210	We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
s04_e10_c14_u211	(now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!
s04_e10_c14_u212	Yes we are. So, coffee?
s04_e10_c14_u213	Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
s04_e10_c14_u214	Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
s04_e10_c15_u215	Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
s04_e10_c15_u216	Thanks.
s04_e10_c15_u217	Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
s04_e10_c15_u218	Enough!
s04_e10_c15_u219	(leaving) Lean-lean-lean!
s04_e10_c16_u220	(singing) "Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along. No, don't sing along.
s01_e22_c01_u001	Hello Rachel.
s01_e22_c01_u002	Get off.
s01_e22_c01_u003	(points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
s01_e22_c01_u004	I don't know. What are you wearing?
s01_e22_c01_u005	Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
s01_e22_c01_u006	Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
s01_e22_c01_u007	Pirates again?
s01_e22_c01_u008	No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
s01_e22_c01_u009	Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
s01_e22_c01_u010	(sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
s01_e22_c01_u011	What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
s01_e22_c01_u012	Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
s01_e22_c01_u013	I could be a secretary.
s01_e22_c01_u014	Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
s01_e22_c01_u015	I could do that.
s01_e22_c01_u016	What are you playing with?
s01_e22_c01_u017	Oh, it's my new beeper.
s01_e22_c01_u018	What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
s01_e22_c01_u019	Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
s01_e22_c01_u020	No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
s01_e22_c01_u021	A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
s01_e22_c01_u022	All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)
s01_e22_c01_u023	Off to see young Ethan?
s01_e22_c01_u024	Thank you.
s01_e22_c01_u025	How young is young Ethan? Young?
s01_e22_c01_u026	He's... our age.
s01_e22_c01_u027	When we were?
s01_e22_c01_u028	Okay, he's a senior in college.
s01_e22_c01_u029	College?
s01_e22_c01_u030	Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
s01_e22_c01_u031	No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
s01_e22_c01_u032	Oh, I can't pass for 22?
s01_e22_c01_u033	Well, maybe 25-26.
s01_e22_c01_u034	I am 26.
s01_e22_c01_u035	There you go.
s01_e22_c02_u036	Can you hear that?
s01_e22_c02_u037	(plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?
s01_e22_c02_u038	See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
s01_e22_c02_u039	Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)
s01_e22_c02_u040	(with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
s01_e22_c02_u041	I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
s01_e22_c02_u042	Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
s01_e22_c02_u043	What?
s01_e22_c02_u044	Ross says hi.
s01_e22_c02_u045	Ah!
s01_e22_c02_u046	This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
s01_e22_c02_u047	Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
s01_e22_c02_u048	Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
s01_e22_c02_u049	Okay.
s01_e22_c02_u050	All right. Bye bye.
s01_e22_c02_u051	Bye bye.
s01_e22_c02_u052	Whatcha doin'?
s01_e22_c02_u053	Ooh. (leans against the desk)
s01_e22_c03_u054	Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?
s01_e22_c03_u055	Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
s01_e22_c03_u056	What?
s01_e22_c03_u057	Could tonight be the Night?
s01_e22_c03_u058	I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
s01_e22_c03_u059	So, did you shave your legs?
s01_e22_c03_u060	Yeah.
s01_e22_c03_u061	A-ha!
s01_e22_c04_u062	Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
s01_e22_c04_u063	Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
s01_e22_c04_u064	All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
s01_e22_c04_u065	(on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, Andre is not here. (to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
s01_e22_c04_u066	Services? (Ross looks at him) Oh, services.
s01_e22_c04_u067	(on phone) Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. (pause) No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. (pause) All rightie, bye bye.
s01_e22_c04_u068	Hey, hey. How was the first day?
s01_e22_c04_u069	Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
s01_e22_c04_u070	See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me.
s01_e22_c04_u071	No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
s01_e22_c04_u072	Why not?
s01_e22_c04_u073	Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
s01_e22_c04_u074	What?!
s01_e22_c04_u075	I thought you knew that.
s01_e22_c04_u076	Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
s01_e22_c04_u077	Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
s01_e22_c04_u078	What are you talking about?
s01_e22_c04_u079	Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".
s01_e22_c04_u080	I can't belive it.
s01_e22_c04_u081	Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
s01_e22_c04_u082	They do me?
s01_e22_c04_u083	You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
s01_e22_c04_u084	I don't sound like that.
s01_e22_c04_u085	Oh, oh Chandler...
s01_e22_c04_u086	Oh... Yeah, you do.
s01_e22_c04_u087	'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
s01_e22_c04_u088	(reaches for hi scones) My scones.
s01_e22_c04_u089	Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
s01_e22_c04_u090	That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
s01_e22_c05_u091	Did not.
s01_e22_c05_u092	I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
s01_e22_c05_u093	How was that possible?
s01_e22_c05_u094	Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go.
s01_e22_c05_u095	Okay.
s01_e22_c05_u096	Okay.
s01_e22_c05_u097	Unless...
s01_e22_c05_u098	What?
s01_e22_c05_u099	Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
s01_e22_c05_u100	Yeah, I'd really like that.
s01_e22_c05_u101	Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
s01_e22_c05_u102	Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
s01_e22_c05_u103	Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
s01_e22_c05_u104	Ethan?
s01_e22_c05_u105	Yeah?
s01_e22_c05_u106	Are you a virgin?
s01_e22_c05_u107	Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
s01_e22_c05_u108	Really?
s01_e22_c05_u109	Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
s01_e22_c05_u110	Wow!
s01_e22_c05_u111	You keep saying that.
s01_e22_c05_u112	You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
s01_e22_c05_u113	Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
s01_e22_c05_u114	Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
s01_e22_c05_u115	No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
s01_e22_c05_u116	Oh.
s01_e22_c05_u117	Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
s01_e22_c05_u118	Huh!
s01_e22_c05_u119	But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
s01_e22_c05_u120	Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
s01_e22_c05_u121	You're not a senior?
s01_e22_c05_u122	Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
s01_e22_c05_u123	Ok...ay.
s01_e22_c06_u124	What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
s01_e22_c06_u125	I just had sex.
s01_e22_c06_u126	Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
s01_e22_c06_u127	Well, you never told me how old you were.
s01_e22_c06_u128	Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
s01_e22_c06_u129	I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
s01_e22_c06_u130	Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)
s01_e22_c06_u131	...in love with you.
s01_e22_c06_u132	Really?
s01_e22_c06_u133	(nods) Sorry.
s01_e22_c06_u134	Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
s01_e22_c06_u135	Who?
s01_e22_c07_u136	(on phone) Okay, Andre should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way.
s01_e22_c07_u137	Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
s01_e22_c07_u138	No, forget it.
s01_e22_c07_u139	Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
s01_e22_c07_u140	All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades to Ross, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too.
s01_e22_c07_u141	All right. (Moves closer.)
s01_e22_c07_u142	Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
s01_e22_c07_u143	No.
s01_e22_c07_u144	You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
s01_e22_c07_u145	No, it was just the three of us.
s01_e22_c07_u146	Huh!
s01_e22_c07_u147	So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
s01_e22_c07_u148	(laughs) You know what?
s01_e22_c07_u149	What?
s01_e22_c07_u150	There were times when it wasn't even me.
s01_e22_c07_u151	That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)
s01_e22_c07_u152	Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
s01_e22_c07_u153	What?
s01_e22_c07_u154	Ethan called again.
s01_e22_c07_u155	Oh.
s01_e22_c07_u156	Are you not seeing him anymore?
s01_e22_c07_u157	No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
s01_e22_c07_u158	And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
s01_e22_c07_u159	I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
s01_e22_c07_u160	Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
s01_e22_c07_u161	Oh, yeah.
s01_e22_c07_u162	Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
s01_e22_c07_u163	It's morphin time!
s01_e22_c07_u164	Stegosaurus!
s01_e22_c07_u165	Tyrannosaurus!
s01_e22_c07_u166	Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!
s01_e22_c07_u167	Where are you going?
s01_e22_c07_u168	Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
s01_e22_c07_u169	Work people? Nobody told me.
s01_e22_c07_u170	No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
s01_e22_c07_u171	You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
s01_e22_c07_u172	Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
s01_e22_c07_u173	You think I should?
s01_e22_c07_u174	I really do, yeah.
s01_e22_c07_u175	Okay.
s01_e22_c07_u176	Okay.
s01_e22_c07_u177	Okay.
s01_e22_c07_u178	Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
s01_e22_c08_u179	I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
s01_e22_c08_u180	You were great. But they still made fun of you.
s01_e22_c08_u181	What?
s01_e22_c08_u182	You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
s01_e22_c08_u183	Then, I don't get it.
s01_e22_c08_u184	Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
s01_e22_c08_u185	They do?
s01_e22_c08_u186	Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
s01_e22_c08_u187	I just wan't to...
s01_e22_c08_u188	No, but you can't.
s01_e22_c08_u189	But I just wa...
s01_e22_c08_u190	Uh uh.
s01_e22_c09_u191	Aren't you gonna...
s01_e22_c09_u192	Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
s01_e22_c09_u193	What about Andre?
s01_e22_c09_u194	Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
s01_e22_c09_u195	Hey.
s01_e22_c09_u196	That was gonna be my opener.
s01_e22_c09_u197	(understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
s01_e22_c09_u198	I thought that was just a rumour.
s01_e22_c09_u199	True story.
s01_e22_c09_u200	They're here already?
s01_e22_c09_u201	All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
s01_e22_c09_u202	It was.
s01_e22_c09_u203	Then, what's the problem?
s01_e22_c09_u204	Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
s01_e22_c09_u205	Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
s01_e22_c09_u206	This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
s01_e22_c09_u207	No, don't say it. (closes Monica's mouth with his hand)
s01_e22_c09_u208	...love you.
s01_e22_c09_u209	Are you're hands still wet?
s01_e22_c09_u210	Uh, moist, yeah.
s01_e22_c09_u211	Let's dry 'em again.
s01_e22_c10_u212	Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? (They discover that Chandler is listening) Hey, Chandler.
s01_e22_c10_u213	Hello, Mr. Bing.
s01_e22_c10_u214	Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
s01_e22_c10_u215	Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
s01_e22_c10_u216	Sure.
s01_e22_c10_u217	No problem.
s01_e22_c10_u218	You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
s01_e22_c10_u219	Petrie.
s01_e22_c10_u220	Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
s01_e22_c11_u221	(talking in her sleep) Oooooooooh. (Rachel strokes her hand over the pillow. Ross mimicks her silently) Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!
s01_e22_c11_u222	Ross?
s01_e22_c11_u223	I'm here.
s01_e22_c11_u224	You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!
s01_e22_c11_u225	What? (his beeper goes off) Great, now I'm having a baby.
s01_e22_c11_u226	What?
s01_e22_c11_u227	Ooh, Ooh.
s01_e22_c11_u228	What?
s01_e22_c11_u229	I'm having... I'm having a baby. (jumps back onto the table again) I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
s01_e22_c11_u230	I don't know where the phone is.
s01_e22_c11_u231	Ross?
s01_e22_c11_u232	I'm hurt.
s01_e22_c12_u233	Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.
s01_e22_c12_u234	(doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
s01_e22_c12_u235	Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
s01_e22_c12_u236	What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
s01_e22_c12_u237	What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
s01_e22_c12_u238	Joey, get out of the fridge.
s01_e22_c12_u239	All right, all right. (he comes out from their apartment with a huge sandwich in his hand)
s01_e22_c12_u240	What is that? (refering to the sandwich)
s01_e22_c12_u241	For the ride.
s01_e22_c12_u242	Yeah, like in a cab...
s01_e22_c12_u243	Save it.
s01_e22_c12_u244	Okay, hating this.
s01_e22_c12_u245	Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.
s01_e22_c12_u246	I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
s01_e22_c12_u247	That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.
s01_e22_c12_u248	All right, I'm going. I'm going.
s01_e22_c12_u249	Here we go, here we go.
s01_e22_c12_u250	Rossy, Rossy.
s03_e13_c01_u001	(to clerk) Hi.
s03_e13_c01_u002	Six dollars, please.
s03_e13_c01_u003	Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
s03_e13_c01_u004	Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, (looks at his watch) aww, it's 8:02.
s03_e13_c01_u005	Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, cause I only have three.
s03_e13_c01_u006	(standing behind her, without his moustache) I can help with that.
s03_e13_c01_u007	Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!
s03_e13_c01_u008	Hi!
s03_e13_c01_u009	Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.
s03_e13_c01_u010	So, you look great.
s03_e13_c01_u011	Right.
s03_e13_c01_u012	No you do. You... just...
s03_e13_c01_u013	What?
s03_e13_c01_u014	You've got panties stuck to your leg.
s03_e13_c01_u015	(removes them) That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
s03_e13_c01_u016	It's good to see you.
s03_e13_c01_u017	It's good to see you too.
s03_e13_c02_u018	You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.
s03_e13_c02_u019	He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. (they both laugh) This is nice.
s03_e13_c02_u020	Yeah.
s03_e13_c02_u021	I missed this.
s03_e13_c02_u022	Me too.
s03_e13_c02_u023	So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
s03_e13_c02_u024	Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
s03_e13_c02_u025	Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise.
s03_e13_c02_u026	No, I just I think that it's too soon.
s03_e13_c02_u027	No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
s03_e13_c03_u028	Yeah, baby!
s03_e13_c03_u029	What are you doing?
s03_e13_c03_u030	Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
s03_e13_c03_u031	No thanks. I'm 29.
s03_e13_c03_u032	(looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!
s03_e13_c03_u033	Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?
s03_e13_c03_u034	Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
s03_e13_c03_u035	Oh come on, not again.
s03_e13_c03_u036	I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
s03_e13_c03_u037	Hmm.
s03_e13_c03_u038	For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
s03_e13_c03_u039	Yeah.
s03_e13_c03_u040	I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
s03_e13_c03_u041	Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
s03_e13_c03_u042	Right.
s03_e13_c03_u043	(entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.
s03_e13_c03_u044	Hey.
s03_e13_c03_u045	(to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
s03_e13_c03_u046	Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
s03_e13_c03_u047	And what are you going to do for him?
s03_e13_c03_u048	I'm going to let him.
s03_e13_c03_u049	Okay.
s03_e13_c03_u050	Cool.
s03_e13_c03_u051	(entering from her bedroom) Morning.
s03_e13_c03_u052	Hey.
s03_e13_c03_u053	Somebody got in late last night.
s03_e13_c03_u054	Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
s03_e13_c03_u055	When did this happen?
s03_e13_c03_u056	Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
s03_e13_c03_u057	Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
s03_e13_c03_u058	So, are you gonna see him again?
s03_e13_c03_u059	Tomorrow night.
s03_e13_c03_u060	Monica, what are you doing?
s03_e13_c03_u061	Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
s03_e13_c03_u062	It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
s03_e13_c03_u063	Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
s03_e13_c03_u064	We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends.
s03_e13_c03_u065	Naked friends.
s03_e13_c04_u066	(entering) Hey.
s03_e13_c04_u067	Hey.
s03_e13_c04_u068	Do you have any ice?
s03_e13_c04_u069	Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late.
s03_e13_c04_u070	Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
s03_e13_c04_u071	I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
s03_e13_c04_u072	Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
s03_e13_c04_u073	Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
s03_e13_c04_u074	But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
s03_e13_c04_u075	Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
s03_e13_c04_u076	How often do you read it?
s03_e13_c04_u077	Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
s03_e13_c04_u078	Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?
s03_e13_c04_u079	The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
s03_e13_c04_u080	Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn't want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.
s03_e13_c04_u081	All right, you got it.
s03_e13_c04_u082	All right.
s03_e13_c04_u083	Okay.
s03_e13_c04_u084	Okay.
s03_e13_c04_u085	Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
s03_e13_c04_u086	Yeah.
s03_e13_c04_u087	How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
s03_e13_c05_u088	Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
s03_e13_c05_u089	Oh, hey.
s03_e13_c05_u090	Hi.
s03_e13_c05_u091	Hey.
s03_e13_c05_u092	(to Robert) You've have lipstick right here (points to her cheek). That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed.
s03_e13_c05_u093	Oh.
s03_e13_c05_u094	(to Robert) So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?
s03_e13_c05_u095	Well, I'm from California.
s03_e13_c05_u096	Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
s03_e13_c05_u097	(standing up) I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?
s03_e13_c05_u098	I'll have coffee.
s03_e13_c05_u099	Yeah, me too.
s03_e13_c05_u100	Yeah, make that three.
s03_e13_c05_u101	Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?
s03_e13_c05_u102	Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter with you? What's going on?
s03_e13_c05_u103	Robert's coming out.
s03_e13_c05_u104	What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?
s03_e13_c05_u105	No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
s03_e13_c05_u106	What?!
s03_e13_c05_u107	The man is showing brain.
s03_e13_c05_u108	Are you sure? (Chandler nods: Yes!) Hold on. (walks over behind the couch) I'm sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
s03_e13_c05_u109	Coffee.
s03_e13_c05_u110	Okay.
s03_e13_c05_u111	We could write it down for you?
s03_e13_c05_u112	No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary (leans down and looks up Robert's shorts, seeing Robert's package.)
s03_e13_c05_u113	(to Ross) Wellll?
s03_e13_c05_u114	Yeah, yeah, yeah!
s03_e13_c05_u115	What do we do? What do we do?
s03_e13_c05_u116	Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
s03_e13_c05_u117	Like an eclipse.
s03_e13_c06_u118	So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?
s03_e13_c06_u119	You say Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
s03_e13_c06_u120	Ew, this feels very weird.
s03_e13_c06_u121	You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
s03_e13_c06_u122	Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. (Monica grabs his hand in the tomatoes.) That's my hand.
s03_e13_c06_u123	Oops.
s03_e13_c06_u124	Okay.
s03_e13_c06_u125	Gotta keep squishing.
s03_e13_c06_u126	Tomatoes are squishing.
s03_e13_c06_u127	Okay.
s03_e13_c06_u128	Op.
s03_e13_c06_u129	Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
s03_e13_c06_u130	Yeah.
s03_e13_c06_u131	Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it should umm, be.....
s03_e13_c06_u132	What?
s03_e13_c06_u133	Umm, you've got some on your pants.
s03_e13_c06_u134	I'll just throw them out.
s03_e13_c07_u135	These little women. Wow!
s03_e13_c07_u136	Your liking it, huh?
s03_e13_c07_u137	Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
s03_e13_c07_u138	Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.
s03_e13_c07_u139	But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
s03_e13_c07_u140	No, actually Laurie's a boy.
s03_e13_c07_u141	No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
s03_e13_c07_u142	Hey!
s03_e13_c07_u143	Hey.
s03_e13_c07_u144	Hey! How'd the ah, basketball go?
s03_e13_c07_u145	Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
s03_e13_c07_u146	You mean a three pointer?
s03_e13_c07_u147	Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
s03_e13_c07_u148	So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
s03_e13_c07_u149	Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
s03_e13_c07_u150	Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
s03_e13_c07_u151	(noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory) Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met.
s03_e13_c07_u152	Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
s03_e13_c07_u153	What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!
s03_e13_c07_u154	Calm down. There's no reason to get testy.
s03_e13_c07_u155	You guys!! Come on!
s03_e13_c07_u156	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
s03_e13_c07_u157	What do you mean?
s03_e13_c07_u158	Hey. (sits down)
s03_e13_c07_u159	Hey.
s03_e13_c07_u160	Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
s03_e13_c07_u161	Sure.
s03_e13_c08_u162	So, how'd the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. (listens) I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) It's a word!
s03_e13_c08_u163	Yeah, I do think it's better this way. (listens) Yeah, we're being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I'm sure.(she opens the door and it's Richard)
s03_e13_c08_u164	You really sure?
s03_e13_c08_u165	I'll call you back. (starts kissing him)
s03_e13_c09_u166	So we can be friends who sleep together.
s03_e13_c09_u167	Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
s03_e13_c09_u168	Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
s03_e13_c09_u169	Just your dad. (pause) Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
s03_e13_c09_u170	Oh.
s03_e13_c09_u171	You want me to cancel it?
s03_e13_c09_u172	No! (pushes him) No!
s03_e13_c09_u173	Okay.
s03_e13_c09_u174	Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends.
s03_e13_c09_u175	Exactly. (pushes her back)
s03_e13_c10_u176	Hey.
s03_e13_c10_u177	Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
s03_e13_c10_u178	You ready to go to the batting cage?
s03_e13_c10_u179	Yeah. And, first here's a gift.
s03_e13_c10_u180	Oh! Wow! Hey!
s03_e13_c10_u181	Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
s03_e13_c10_u182	Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these, they're so tight, I feel like I'm on display. I'm sorry.
s03_e13_c10_u183	That's all right, that's well, I figured.... (they start to leave as Joey enters.)
s03_e13_c10_u184	(to Joey) Hey!
s03_e13_c10_u185	Hey! (starts to laugh.) How's it going?
s03_e13_c10_u186	Good.
s03_e13_c10_u187	Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
s03_e13_c10_u188	Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
s03_e13_c10_u189	Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
s03_e13_c10_u190	Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!
s03_e13_c10_u191	All right I'll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
s03_e13_c10_u192	Hmmm, that's very cool.
s03_e13_c10_u193	Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
s03_e13_c10_u194	Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
s03_e13_c10_u195	I can't believe she cracked your code!
s03_e13_c10_u196	All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
s03_e13_c10_u197	Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
s03_e13_c10_u198	Eh. Beth dies.
s03_e13_c10_u199	Beth, Beth dies?
s03_e13_c10_u200	Um-hmm.
s03_e13_c10_u201	Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
s03_e13_c10_u202	No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?
s03_e13_c10_u203	What?!
s03_e13_c10_u204	Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
s03_e13_c10_u205	No. She doesn't die.
s03_e13_c10_u206	Then why would you say that?!
s03_e13_c10_u207	Because, I wanted to hurt you.
s03_e13_c10_u208	(running in) Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.
s03_e13_c10_u209	(gasps) Oh my....
s03_e13_c10_u210	Got em.
s03_e13_c11_u211	Hi.
s03_e13_c11_u212	(screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I'm sorry.
s03_e13_c11_u213	You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast.) in a grill fire.
s03_e13_c11_u214	What are you smiling at?
s03_e13_c11_u215	I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up.
s03_e13_c11_u216	Yeah, right.
s03_e13_c11_u217	Hello.
s03_e13_c11_u218	I love this friend thing!
s03_e13_c12_u219	Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
s03_e13_c12_u220	Oh.
s03_e13_c12_u221	Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like Is it on the lose?' Is it watching me?'
s03_e13_c12_u222	We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
s03_e13_c12_u223	He's right, even if it's to say something complementary. (He stops and thinks about what he just said.)
s03_e13_c12_u224	(entering) Hey!
s03_e13_c12_u225	Hey.
s03_e13_c12_u226	(to Phoebe) So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
s03_e13_c12_u227	No, I can spot you from here.
s03_e13_c12_u228	What?
s03_e13_c12_u229	Okay, listen Robert...
s03_e13_c12_u230	(to Chandler) Hey, don't we have to...
s03_e13_c12_u231	Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
s03_e13_c12_u232	Umm, I think you're really, really great...
s03_e13_c12_u233	Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? (spreads his legs) Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
s03_e13_c12_u234	I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say.
s03_e13_c12_u235	(cleaning up the table) (to Robert) Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
s03_e13_c13_u236	Ow!
s03_e13_c13_u237	(outside the bedroom) Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
s03_e13_c13_u238	Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
s03_e13_c13_u239	Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as Richard starts the tour.)
s03_e13_c13_u240	Ah well, this is the living room.
s03_e13_c13_u241	Impressive.
s03_e13_c13_u242	All right. This is the kitchen.
s03_e13_c13_u243	Oh, that's real pretty. Wait a minute, don't I get to see the bedroom?
s03_e13_c13_u244	The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... (opens the door as Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the room.) bedroom.
s03_e13_c13_u245	We're still on this side of the door.
s03_e13_c13_u246	Um-hmm.
s03_e13_c13_u247	Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
s03_e13_c13_u248	Oh shoot! Maybe next time. (yawns) Thanks for a lovely evening. (shows her out)
s03_e13_c13_u249	(still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?
s03_e13_c13_u250	Oh, (laughs) that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
s03_e13_c13_u251	(still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
s03_e13_c13_u252	Well, you seem fine.
s03_e13_c13_u253	(gets up) Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?
s03_e13_c13_u254	You mean like exclusive friends?
s03_e13_c13_u255	Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
s03_e13_c13_u256	Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
s03_e13_c13_u257	That's not true, you don't have a moustache.
s03_e13_c13_u258	Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
s03_e13_c13_u259	Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again.
s03_e13_c13_u260	I know I couldn't. So....
s03_e13_c13_u261	How bout one last game of racquetball?
s03_e13_c13_u262	Watch the thorns!
s03_e13_c13_u263	(lying down) Ow!!
s03_e13_c14_u264	What?
s03_e13_c14_u265	Beth is really, really sick.
s03_e13_c14_u266	Awwww.
s03_e13_c14_u267	Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do.
s03_e13_c14_u268	Joey?
s03_e13_c14_u269	Yeah.
s03_e13_c14_u270	Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
s03_e13_c14_u271	(nodding his head) Okay.
s03_e13_c14_u272	Okay.
s04_e22_c01_u001	(angrily) That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
s04_e22_c01_u002	That's also like the tenth time you told us.
s04_e22_c01_u003	Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!
s04_e22_c01_u004	Pheebs, did-you want a cookie?
s04_e22_c01_u005	(starting to cry) Thank you so much.
s04_e22_c01_u006	So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
s04_e22_c01_u007	I haven't really had any yet.
s04_e22_c02_u008	Hey guys!
s04_e22_c02_u009	Hey.
s04_e22_c02_u010	Hey!
s04_e22_c02_u011	All right, here's the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans on giving Emily)
s04_e22_c02_u012	(shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
s04_e22_c02_u013	So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
s04_e22_c02_u014	Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
s04_e22_c02_u015	Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward.
s04_e22_c02_u016	I sort've already asked Chandler.
s04_e22_c02_u017	What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
s04_e22_c02_u018	Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.
s04_e22_c02_u019	Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!
s04_e22_c02_u020	You can be the best man when I get married.
s04_e22_c02_u021	(pause) I'll never get to be a best man!
s04_e22_c02_u022	(to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
s04_e22_c02_u023	Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
s04_e22_c02_u024	(impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you just said I could!
s04_e22_c02_u025	I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
s04_e22_c02_u026	I can't believe you're not picking me.
s04_e22_c02_u027	Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
s04_e22_c02_u028	I'm not even- I'm not even
s04_e22_c02_u029	Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
s04_e22_c02_u030	Yes! (to Chandler) Shame about you man.
s04_e22_c03_u031	(to her babies) Stop it!
s04_e22_c03_u032	What?
s04_e22_c03_u033	One of the babies is kicking.
s04_e22_c03_u034	I thought that was a good thing.
s04_e22_c03_u035	It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh (looks down her dress)! Don't make me come in there!
s04_e22_c03_u036	(entering) Hey!
s04_e22_c03_u037	Hey!
s04_e22_c03_u038	Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
s04_e22_c03_u039	Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
s04_e22_c03_u040	(grabs it) Thanks.
s04_e22_c03_u041	Why do you need it?
s04_e22_c03_u042	Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later! (Starts for the door.)
s04_e22_c03_u043	Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
s04_e22_c03_u044	Nooo, later. (Walks out the door.)
s04_e22_c03_u045	Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)
s04_e22_c03_u046	Hormones!
s04_e22_c03_u047	What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
s04_e22_c03_u048	Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party.
s04_e22_c03_u049	Sooo?
s04_e22_c03_u050	Are you bachelors?
s04_e22_c03_u051	Nooo!
s04_e22_c03_u052	Are you strippers?
s04_e22_c03_u053	Nooo!
s04_e22_c03_u054	Then you're not invited. (Starts for the door again.)
s04_e22_c03_u055	All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
s04_e22_c03_u056	Oh-whoa, what party?
s04_e22_c03_u057	Well umm
s04_e22_c03_u058	The baby shower for Phoebe!
s04_e22_c03_u059	Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)
s04_e22_c03_u060	I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! (Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don't know why.
s04_e22_c04_u061	This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
s04_e22_c04_u062	Great. Great.
s04_e22_c04_u063	Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud.
s04_e22_c04_u064	I'll be there.
s04_e22_c04_u065	All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
s04_e22_c04_u066	Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
s04_e22_c04_u067	Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
s04_e22_c04_u068	(entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?
s04_e22_c04_u069	Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
s04_e22_c04_u070	Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
s04_e22_c04_u071	Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
s04_e22_c04_u072	Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
s04_e22_c04_u073	Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
s04_e22_c04_u074	You got it.
s04_e22_c04_u075	Okay, see ya later.
s04_e22_c04_u076	See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.) Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
s04_e22_c04_u077	Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers.
s04_e22_c04_u078	He just said, "No strippers."
s04_e22_c04_u079	Oh, I chose not to hear that.
s04_e22_c05_u080	Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?
s04_e22_c05_u081	Little village people.
s04_e22_c05_u082	Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (It's a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)
s04_e22_c05_u083	Oh, that is so sweet!
s04_e22_c05_u084	I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
s04_e22_c05_u085	Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
s04_e22_c05_u086	Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
s04_e22_c05_u087	Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
s04_e22_c05_u088	Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.
s04_e22_c05_u089	Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!
s04_e22_c05_u090	Oh, she's gonna love that!
s04_e22_c06_u091	What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!
s04_e22_c07_u092	Hey listen man, about the stripper
s04_e22_c07_u093	Yeah?
s04_e22_c07_u094	Good call!
s04_e22_c07_u095	(banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
s04_e22_c07_u096	What's my last name?
s04_e22_c07_u097	Central Perk?
s04_e22_c07_u098	(to Ross) Thanks for not marrying Rachel. (He starts to leave.)
s04_e22_c07_u099	Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt. (He gives Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)
s04_e22_c07_u100	Hey-hey, what are those?
s04_e22_c07_u101	Oh, little party favours, check it out! (It's a shirt that reads, "Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998")
s04_e22_c07_u102	Wow! Yeah!
s04_e22_c07_u103	Oh-oh! (Shows him what's on the back, "Best Man Joey Tribbiani, with a huge picture of him.)
s04_e22_c07_u104	(banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.
s04_e22_c07_u105	Great!
s04_e22_c07_u106	Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.
s04_e22_c07_u107	Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt.
s04_e22_c07_u108	Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)
s04_e22_c07_u109	Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
s04_e22_c07_u110	Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?
s04_e22_c07_u111	Yeah!
s04_e22_c07_u112	Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.
s04_e22_c07_u113	Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck complies.)
s04_e22_c07_u114	You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.
s04_e22_c07_u115	Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday
s04_e22_c07_u116	Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.
s04_e22_c07_u117	Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
s04_e22_c07_u118	Yeah?
s04_e22_c07_u119	Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
s04_e22_c08_u120	Hey, (realises he doesn't know her name.) stripper! (He notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it's empty and starts to panic.)
s04_e22_c09_u121	(running and banging on Chandler's door) The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
s04_e22_c09_u122	(opening the door) What?
s04_e22_c09_u123	The ring is gone!
s04_e22_c09_u124	Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!
s04_e22_c09_u125	Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!
s04_e22_c09_u126	You slept with the stripper?
s04_e22_c09_u127	Of course!! (Shrugs.)
s04_e22_c10_u128	Hi, guys.
s04_e22_c10_u129	Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe's way.)
s04_e22_c10_u130	Hi Phoebe.
s04_e22_c10_u131	I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know.
s04_e22_c10_u132	No we
s04_e22_c10_u133	Hormones.
s04_e22_c10_u134	hormones, yeah.
s04_e22_c10_u135	Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)
s04_e22_c10_u136	Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?
s04_e22_c10_u137	Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?
s04_e22_c10_u138	Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.
s04_e22_c10_u139	Oh!
s04_e22_c10_u140	It just might be too hard, given the history and all that
s04_e22_c10_u141	Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
s04_e22_c10_u142	Well, h-how is this like that?
s04_e22_c10_u143	Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know
s04_e22_c10_u144	(starting to cry) I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that
s04_e22_c10_u145	Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)
s04_e22_c11_u146	Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?
s04_e22_c11_u147	(entering) Hey guys!
s04_e22_c11_u148	Hey!
s04_e22_c11_u149	Hey
s04_e22_c11_u150	I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
s04_e22_c11_u151	So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!
s04_e22_c11_u152	Yeah, right!
s04_e22_c11_u153	I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
s04_e22_c11_u154	That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
s04_e22_c11_u155	So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)
s04_e22_c11_u156	Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
s04_e22_c11_u157	So you might say, it's a magic ring.
s04_e22_c11_u158	(laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.
s04_e22_c11_u159	My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
s04_e22_c11_u160	Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."
s04_e22_c11_u161	(dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!
s04_e22_c11_u162	Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!
s04_e22_c11_u163	Not on you! On the stripper!
s04_e22_c11_u164	Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
s04_e22_c11_u165	Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!
s04_e22_c11_u166	I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they'd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"
s04_e22_c11_u167	So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
s04_e22_c11_u168	Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I
s04_e22_c11_u169	Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
s04_e22_c11_u170	Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!
s04_e22_c12_u171	Here's your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a step back.)
s04_e22_c12_u172	(sips it) It's so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh, thanks.
s04_e22_c12_u173	Good.
s04_e22_c12_u174	I'm so glad you liked it.
s04_e22_c12_u175	(sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
s04_e22_c12_u176	What?!
s04_e22_c12_u177	What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
s04_e22_c12_u178	Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
s04_e22_c12_u179	You what?
s04_e22_c12_u180	Oh my God!
s04_e22_c12_u181	Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
s04_e22_c12_u182	Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
s04_e22_c12_u183	Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
s04_e22_c12_u184	No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
s04_e22_c12_u185	Rachel, get the book! The book!
s04_e22_c12_u186	Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
s04_e22_c12_u187	The Bible?!
s04_e22_c12_u188	I don't know!
s04_e22_c13_u189	All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong.
s04_e22_c13_u190	Diverse.
s04_e22_c13_u191	Did anybody call for security?
s04_e22_c13_u192	(to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
s04_e22_c13_u193	Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.) Hey, Joey?
s04_e22_c13_u194	Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
s04_e22_c13_u195	Way to be cool, man.
s04_e22_c13_u196	What's he talking about?
s04_e22_c13_u197	There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
s04_e22_c13_u198	Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
s04_e22_c13_u199	We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
s04_e22_c13_u200	Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
s04_e22_c13_u201	Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
s04_e22_c14_u202	I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you (Chandler) didn't take it, then who did? (The duck quacks.) Shh! We're trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn't get it. After a short pause, with the duck still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)
s04_e22_c15_u203	I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
s04_e22_c15_u204	Well, do you see any babies?
s04_e22_c15_u205	How do you feel?
s04_e22_c15_u206	Okay, I guess. I mean- I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon.
s04_e22_c15_u207	Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
s04_e22_c15_u208	I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
s04_e22_c15_u209	Some moms do that.
s04_e22_c15_u210	Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
s04_e22_c15_u211	Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.
s04_e22_c15_u212	Yeah, okay.
s04_e22_c15_u213	No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?
s04_e22_c15_u214	I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
s04_e22_c15_u215	And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
s04_e22_c15_u216	Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
s04_e22_c15_u217	Yeah.
s04_e22_c15_u218	And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.
s04_e22_c15_u219	They are gonna love me.
s04_e22_c15_u220	Oh!
s04_e22_c15_u221	Thanks you guys! Again.
s04_e22_c15_u222	Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)
s04_e22_c15_u223	You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
s04_e22_c15_u224	Just kidding. Ahh!
s04_e22_c15_u225	What?!
s04_e22_c15_u226	Oh my God!
s04_e22_c15_u227	Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
s04_e22_c16_u228	If anything should happen to him
s04_e22_c16_u229	Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
s04_e22_c16_u230	So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
s04_e22_c16_u231	He will, Joe.
s04_e22_c16_u232	Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.
s04_e22_c16_u233	I'm so worried about him, y'know?
s04_e22_c16_u234	(coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?
s04_e22_c16_u235	Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where it's been.)
s04_e22_c16_u236	H-h-h-how's the duck?
s04_e22_c16_u237	He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
s04_e22_c16_u238	Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
s04_e22_c16_u239	No, that's all right.
s04_e22_c16_u240	No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
s04_e22_c16_u241	Hey, come on, it's not your fault.
s04_e22_c16_u242	Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.
s04_e22_c16_u243	No, you should.
s04_e22_c16_u244	Now, don't argue with me
s04_e22_c16_u245	Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
s04_e22_c16_u246	Really?
s04_e22_c16_u247	Really?
s04_e22_c16_u248	Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my- I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good- (They all start getting emotional.)
s04_e22_c16_u249	Thanks man.
s04_e22_c16_u250	(starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so that they can't see him cry.)
s04_e22_c16_u251	What a baby.
s04_e22_c16_u252	Total wuss!
s04_e14_c01_u001	(holding a lure) So now, what is this now?
s04_e14_c01_u002	Guggly worm.
s04_e14_c01_u003	(laughs and picks up another lure) And this?
s04_e14_c01_u004	Glow-pop giggly jammer.
s04_e14_c01_u005	(laughs harder) You make it so funny.
s04_e14_c01_u006	(not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what's this?
s04_e14_c01_u007	(examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the sandwich)
s04_e14_c01_u008	(pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It's the classic struggle between man and-(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone knocked over a lamp.
s04_e14_c01_u009	(going over and picking up the rod) That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
s04_e14_c01_u010	Great!
s04_e14_c01_u011	You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)
s04_e14_c01_u012	Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
s04_e14_c01_u013	Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
s04_e14_c01_u014	What's Phase Two?
s04_e14_c01_u015	Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
s04_e14_c01_u016	How does going to a strip club help him better?
s04_e14_c01_u017	Because there are naked ladies there.
s04_e14_c01_u018	Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
s04_e14_c01_u019	There are naked ladies there too.
s04_e14_c01_u020	Yeah.
s04_e14_c01_u021	(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.
s04_e14_c02_u022	So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
s04_e14_c02_u023	Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at his ass.) There we go. There it is.
s04_e14_c02_u024	(turning around) Oh! You know what I need?
s04_e14_c02_u025	Yeah!
s04_e14_c02_u026	Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.
s04_e14_c02_u027	Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. (Grabs his hand.) You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-(Grabs the other hand.)
s04_e14_c02_u028	Also large?
s04_e14_c02_u029	Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
s04_e14_c02_u030	Okay.
s04_e14_c02_u031	(entering) Rachel! Could I have a moment?
s04_e14_c02_u032	Yes.
s04_e14_c02_u033	I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London-well Shropshire really but y'know-well she's about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you'd like to keep her company this evening?
s04_e14_c02_u034	Sure. You got it. Great!
s04_e14_c02_u035	Oh, good.
s04_e14_c02_u036	Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-(motions to Joshua.)
s04_e14_c02_u037	Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
s04_e14_c02_u038	So-(Holds out his hands as to say, "Where are my gloves?")
s04_e14_c02_u039	So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and hoping for something more intimate.)
s04_e14_c02_u040	Gloves?
s04_e14_c02_u041	Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!
s04_e14_c02_u042	Uhh, actually y'know what, I kinda-I have to take off.
s04_e14_c02_u043	Oh.
s04_e14_c02_u044	But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?
s04_e14_c02_u045	No! Nothing!
s04_e14_c02_u046	I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, would you like to come?
s04_e14_c02_u047	Yeah! That would be great!
s04_e14_c02_u048	You're into hardcore S&M right?
s04_e14_c02_u049	(shocked) Well, I-I guess-I
s04_e14_c02_u050	Kidding! (Rachel is relived) I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.
s04_e14_c02_u051	Yeah, great, you betcha!
s04_e14_c02_u052	(entering) I almost forget the tickets, didn't I?
s04_e14_c02_u053	What?
s04_e14_c02_u054	For you and Emily, tonight, Die Fledermaus.
s04_e14_c02_u055	Oh. Oh, right.
s04_e14_c02_u056	I think you'll like it, it has two out of the three tenors.
s04_e14_c02_u057	Oh yay!
s04_e14_c03_u058	Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
s04_e14_c03_u059	Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take em off and we'll have some fun.
s04_e14_c03_u060	(entering) Hey-hey!
s04_e14_c03_u061	Hi!
s04_e14_c03_u062	Hey!
s04_e14_c03_u063	Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)
s04_e14_c03_u064	Oh my God, you guys have no idea.
s04_e14_c03_u065	(they all recoil from the smell emanating from him) Oh! God! Wow!
s04_e14_c03_u066	You stink!
s04_e14_c03_u067	Are you kidding?!
s04_e14_c03_u068	Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?
s04_e14_c03_u069	He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
s04_e14_c03_u070	(goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! How's it going?
s04_e14_c03_u071	(To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
s04_e14_c03_u072	(entering) Hey!
s04_e14_c03_u073	Hey!
s04_e14_c03_u074	Hey, Monica!
s04_e14_c03_u075	Uh-oh, what's the matter?
s04_e14_c03_u076	Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So- What are you gonna do?
s04_e14_c03_u077	I don't know sweetie.
s04_e14_c03_u078	No! Help me!
s04_e14_c03_u079	I can't! I have to work!
s04_e14_c03_u080	Phoebe?
s04_e14_c03_u081	I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
s04_e14_c03_u082	Ugh!
s04_e14_c03_u083	Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
s04_e14_c03_u084	Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the "Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
s04_e14_c03_u085	No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell.
s04_e14_c03_u086	Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!
s04_e14_c03_u087	Hi!
s04_e14_c03_u088	So-.
s04_e14_c03_u089	No.
s04_e14_c03_u090	Ohhhh, come on!!!
s04_e14_c03_u091	I think she's here.
s04_e14_c03_u092	No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!
s04_e14_c03_u093	You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
s04_e14_c03_u094	(looking out the peephole) Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!
s04_e14_c03_u095	I'll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
s04_e14_c03_u096	All right, I'll do it.
s04_e14_c03_u097	Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.) Emily?
s04_e14_c03_u098	Yes.
s04_e14_c03_u099	I'm Rachel Green.
s04_e14_c03_u100	Thank goodness.
s04_e14_c03_u101	There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So
s04_e14_c03_u102	Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
s04_e14_c03_u103	Oh well, no I
s04_e14_c03_u104	Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
s04_e14_c03_u105	I-I-I think you look great.
s04_e14_c03_u106	Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)
s04_e14_c03_u107	I'll get her.
s04_e14_c03_u108	Please hurry.
s04_e14_c03_u109	Don't you just love the way they talk?!
s04_e14_c04_u110	Ohh!
s04_e14_c04_u111	What?
s04_e14_c04_u112	It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
s04_e14_c04_u113	Oh my God!
s04_e14_c04_u114	Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
s04_e14_c04_u115	(running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
s04_e14_c04_u116	Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!
s04_e14_c04_u117	Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.
s04_e14_c04_u118	Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell.
s04_e14_c04_u119	Hey-whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey runs off.) Wow!
s04_e14_c04_u120	So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
s04_e14_c04_u121	Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.
s04_e14_c04_u122	What?
s04_e14_c04_u123	Why?
s04_e14_c04_u124	The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
s04_e14_c04_u125	Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?
s04_e14_c04_u126	No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
s04_e14_c04_u127	So you hit her in the face?
s04_e14_c04_u128	No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
s04_e14_c04_u129	(going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.
s04_e14_c04_u130	Honey, that's you're name.
s04_e14_c04_u131	That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
s04_e14_c04_u132	Hey! You're wearing pants!
s04_e14_c04_u133	That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
s04_e14_c04_u134	It's 9:30 in the morning!
s04_e14_c04_u135	They got a breakfast buffet.
s04_e14_c04_u136	Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!
s04_e14_c04_u137	Ooh, let me talk to him!
s04_e14_c04_u138	Oh-oh, my God!
s04_e14_c04_u139	Well, can I just
s04_e14_c04_u140	(to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?
s04_e14_c04_u141	She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
s04_e14_c04_u142	Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
s04_e14_c04_u143	He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
s04_e14_c04_u144	What? Oh my God!
s04_e14_c04_u145	What? Who the hell is Emily-(realises) noooo!!
s04_e14_c05_u146	They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms franticly and hits Chandler.)
s04_e14_c05_u147	Ow!
s04_e14_c05_u148	How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits Chandler again.)
s04_e14_c05_u149	Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time.
s04_e14_c05_u150	When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
s04_e14_c05_u151	(rushing in) Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
s04_e14_c05_u152	I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)
s04_e14_c05_u153	He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
s04_e14_c05_u154	I don't get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)
s04_e14_c05_u155	Okay, I'm going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)
s04_e14_c05_u156	Why do you care so much anyway?
s04_e14_c05_u157	I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
s04_e14_c05_u158	Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
s04_e14_c05_u159	Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every-little-thing!! (Storms out.)
s04_e14_c05_u160	So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?
s04_e14_c05_u161	A couple of days.
s04_e14_c05_u162	Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)
s04_e14_c05_u163	What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
s04_e14_c05_u164	Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time.
s04_e14_c05_u165	Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
s04_e14_c05_u166	Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
s04_e14_c05_u167	(laughs) No you can't.
s04_e14_c05_u168	Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
s04_e14_c05_u169	You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)
s04_e14_c05_u170	Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
s04_e14_c05_u171	Okay. (Starts to cry)
s04_e14_c05_u172	I'm sorry. (Goes and hugs him)
s04_e14_c06_u173	(rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
s04_e14_c06_u174	Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late.
s04_e14_c06_u175	Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
s04_e14_c06_u176	Yeah, we loves em. I've never seen him with-(He gets a whiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)
s04_e14_c06_u177	(trying to act like he's not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
s04_e14_c06_u178	You.
s04_e14_c06_u179	Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?
s04_e14_c06_u180	You?
s04_e14_c06_u181	No-no, it's uh, it's Heston.
s04_e14_c06_u182	What?
s04_e14_c06_u183	Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
s04_e14_c06_u184	There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
s04_e14_c06_u185	Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?
s04_e14_c06_u186	The one with "Heston" on it.
s04_e14_c06_u187	Interesting.
s04_e14_c07_u188	(coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
s04_e14_c07_u189	No thanks, Mom!
s04_e14_c07_u190	Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, cause I'm pregnant.
s04_e14_c07_u191	(No, not the Cigarette Smoking Man from The X-Files.) Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
s04_e14_c07_u192	Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)
s04_e14_c07_u193	Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer's hot pants) so good.
s04_e14_c07_u194	(doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
s04_e14_c07_u195	(joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
s04_e14_c07_u196	Come on! Look where you are!!
s04_e14_c07_u197	(to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
s04_e14_c07_u198	Remember, a virgin for me please.
s04_e14_c07_u199	Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
s04_e14_c07_u200	Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
s04_e14_c07_u201	Well, if you think it will help.
s04_e14_c07_u202	No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice
s04_e14_c07_u203	You should! How is she?
s04_e14_c07_u204	Ohhh!!
s04_e14_c07_u205	I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)
s04_e14_c08_u206	Hello! Who's in there? (He opens to curtain to reveal a naked and wet Joey.)
s04_e14_c08_u207	How ya doin'?
s04_e14_c08_u208	Who in the hell are you?
s04_e14_c08_u209	I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
s04_e14_c08_u210	Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
s04_e14_c08_u211	No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
s04_e14_c08_u212	(shocked) You're in this picture?
s04_e14_c08_u213	Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!
s04_e14_c08_u214	Joey, right?
s04_e14_c08_u215	Yeah.
s04_e14_c08_u216	(tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the shower and sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or another-opp! (Joey tries to sit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.) Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
s04_e14_c08_u217	Oh no-no-no, you don't understand
s04_e14_c08_u218	Listen to me!
s04_e14_c08_u219	Oh yeah, yeah.
s04_e14_c08_u220	I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!
s04_e14_c08_u221	Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-(he starts to leave)
s04_e14_c08_u222	Wait a minute! Take your pants.
s04_e14_c08_u223	Yeah. Oh, yeah.
s04_e14_c09_u224	So, we did okay at the strip club, right?
s04_e14_c09_u225	Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
s04_e14_c09_u226	(entering) I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
s04_e14_c09_u227	Who, Josh?
s04_e14_c09_u228	It's Joshua.
s04_e14_c09_u229	What, he doesn't like Josh?
s04_e14_c09_u230	No, I don't.
s04_e14_c09_u231	All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
s04_e14_c09_u232	Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls.
s04_e14_c09_u233	Yeah?
s04_e14_c09_u234	And do you know what girls are really good at?
s04_e14_c09_u235	Stripping!
s04_e14_c09_u236	No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
s04_e14_c09_u237	Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)
s04_e14_c09_u238	Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
s04_e14_c09_u239	Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
s04_e14_c09_u240	Come on! Chandler!
s04_e14_c09_u241	Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)
s04_e14_c09_u242	They really were pretty, weren't they? (Rachel and Phoebe both agree)
s04_e14_c09_u243	Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
s04_e14_c09_u244	Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!
s04_e14_c09_u245	Yeah.
s04_e14_c09_u246	Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is intrigued.) It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
s04_e14_c09_u247	See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal.
s04_e14_c09_u248	Oh, Chantal!
s04_e14_c09_u249	Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh
s04_e14_c09_u250	(jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
s04_e14_c09_u251	Really?!
s04_e14_c09_u252	I am totally picturing you with all those women!
s04_e14_c09_u253	That's-that's not Phase Three.
s04_e14_c09_u254	Well, I'm there too!
s04_e14_c09_u255	Well, are we all together? Like in a group?
s04_e14_c09_u256	Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
s04_e14_c09_u257	Oh! What is that? What is that?
s04_e14_c09_u258	Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
s04_e14_c10_u259	Come on, let me see that smile.
s04_e14_c10_u260	I don't wanna.
s04_e14_c10_u261	Please?
s04_e14_c10_u262	I wanted to go to the strip club!
s04_e14_c10_u263	I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
s04_e14_c10_u264	Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)
s04_e14_c10_u265	Hey!
s04_e14_c10_u266	Hey!
s04_e14_c10_u267	Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?
s04_e14_c10_u268	Emily is-incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.) Oh! And you! Rach!
s04_e14_c10_u269	Oh, hey!
s04_e14_c10_u270	Hey! You were so right!
s04_e14_c10_u271	What?
s04_e14_c10_u272	Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
s04_e14_c10_u273	Oh, hmm.
s04_e14_c10_u274	I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy
s04_e14_c10_u275	Joshua.
s04_e14_c10_u276	Joshua-guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda-y'know.
s04_e14_c10_u277	Yeah, I
s04_e14_c10_u278	But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
s04_e14_c10_u279	Oh, thank goodness!
s04_e14_c10_u280	Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.
s04_e14_c10_u281	Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She playfully punches him.)
s04_e14_c10_u282	Happy for you. (He punches her back.)
s04_e14_c10_u283	No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)
s04_e14_c11_u284	All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two, go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
s04_e14_c11_u285	I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.
s04_e14_c11_u286	Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
s04_e14_c11_u287	Wait, now, what am I doing again?
s04_e14_c11_u288	Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
s04_e14_c11_u289	Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel.
s04_e14_c11_u290	No-no-no, that' not Joshua.
s04_e14_c11_u291	What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing Chandler's back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
s08_e23_c01_u001	All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
s08_e23_c01_u002	(deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over.
s08_e23_c01_u003	No, but come on, we're off to a great start aren't we? I knew I'd get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
s08_e23_c01_u004	Oh you made it!
s08_e23_c01_u005	Hi! (Ross is stunned.)
s08_e23_c01_u006	How are you doing?
s08_e23_c01_u007	Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
s08_e23_c01_u008	We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
s08_e23_c01_u009	N- No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!
s08_e23_c01_u010	Hi!
s08_e23_c01_u011	Hey! You made it!
s08_e23_c01_u012	Okay is there-some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
s08_e23_c01_u013	Ross, you stay here and talk, I'm gonna go have a baby.
s08_e23_c01_u014	Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I'm Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
s08_e23_c01_u015	Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a minute
s08_e23_c01_u016	(interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm sorry, semi-private? We (Laughs), we asked for a private room.
s08_e23_c01_u017	Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can't guarantee a private room and currently they're all unavailable.
s08_e23_c01_u018	Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)
s08_e23_c01_u019	I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
s08_e23_c01_u020	Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)
s08_e23_c01_u021	Yeah?
s08_e23_c01_u022	Give her some money.
s08_e23_c01_u023	I really think they're out of rooms.
s08_e23_c01_u024	They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
s08_e23_c01_u025	Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by Rachel.) Uh, say would you umm- Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?
s08_e23_c01_u026	This is a hospital.
s08_e23_c01_u027	(standing up) Okay. Y'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!
s08_e23_c01_u028	What-what?
s08_e23_c01_u029	Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing heavily.)
s08_e23_c01_u030	Would you like to see a semi-private room?
s08_e23_c01_u031	Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
s08_e23_c02_u032	Well you're only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to ten. It'll be a while.
s08_e23_c02_u033	Oh, okay.
s08_e23_c02_u034	I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
s08_e23_c02_u035	Thank you.
s08_e23_c02_u036	Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
s08_e23_c02_u037	Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He's looking at the stirrups on the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his legs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.
s08_e23_c02_u038	Yeah well it looks great!
s08_e23_c02_u039	Thank you very much.
s08_e23_c02_u040	Thanks.
s08_e23_c02_u041	Hi! Hi, I'm uh Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
s08_e23_c02_u042	Oh no-no, not at all.
s08_e23_c02_u043	Don't worry about it.
s08_e23_c02_u044	Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.
s08_e23_c02_u045	Hi Julie.
s08_e23_c02_u046	Hi.
s08_e23_c02_u047	This is Rachel. (Points at her.)
s08_e23_c02_u048	Hi!
s08_e23_c02_u049	Oh hi Rachel.
s08_e23_c02_u050	How are you?
s08_e23_c02_u051	Hi. Is this your first?
s08_e23_c02_u052	Yeah it is.
s08_e23_c02_u053	Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you need anything at all, just holler.
s08_e23_c02_u054	That's so sweet.
s08_e23_c02_u055	Yeah.
s08_e23_c02_u056	Oh.
s08_e23_c02_u057	Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.
s08_e23_c02_u058	No nonsense! We're all in this together.
s08_e23_c02_u059	Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think we're gonna have some fun.
s08_e23_c02_u060	Yeah.
s08_e23_c02_u061	Oh, okay.
s08_e23_c02_u062	Hey! Smile! (Points his camera at Ross and Rachel.)
s08_e23_c02_u063	Oh no, I really don't want any-(He takes the picture)-Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross
s08_e23_c02_u064	What?
s08_e23_c02_u065	Here comes another contraction.
s08_e23_c02_u066	Oh. Okay, just breathe.
s08_e23_c02_u067	Oh honey, I think I'm having one too!
s08_e23_c02_u068	Look at this! (Takes another picture) There we go!
s08_e23_c03_u069	(looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
s08_e23_c03_u070	Hey, you wanna see something?
s08_e23_c03_u071	Sure! What?
s08_e23_c03_u072	Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
s08_e23_c03_u073	Yeah?
s08_e23_c03_u074	Listen uh, I-I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know whether it's because we're here or Rachel's giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
s08_e23_c03_u075	Okay.
s08_e23_c03_u076	(freaking out) What-what-what's that now?!
s08_e23_c03_u077	Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready.
s08_e23_c03_u078	What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we're ready to have a baby now?!
s08_e23_c03_u079	Oh, this is fun.
s08_e23_c03_u080	You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
s08_e23_c03_u081	But you said you were ready too.
s08_e23_c03_u082	Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
s08_e23_c03_u083	Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?
s08_e23_c03_u084	Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
s08_e23_c03_u085	(voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!
s08_e23_c03_u086	That's it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
s08_e23_c04_u087	I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
s08_e23_c04_u088	Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.
s08_e23_c04_u089	Julie's cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that's about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
s08_e23_c04_u090	Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?
s08_e23_c04_u091	(simultaneously as Ross) No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
s08_e23_c04_u092	(simultaneously as Rachel) We're not gonna do that.
s08_e23_c04_u093	Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare.
s08_e23_c04_u094	(entering) Am I interrupting?
s08_e23_c04_u095	Uh yes! Thank you.
s08_e23_c04_u096	Oh. Oh wait no.
s08_e23_c04_u097	Later.
s08_e23_c04_u098	No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
s08_e23_c04_u099	Oh uh, I'm sorry. (Runs out.)
s08_e23_c04_u100	No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
s08_e23_c05_u101	Hi! I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I-I wished you'd called first.
s08_e23_c05_u102	Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father.
s08_e23_c05_u103	Oh good.
s08_e23_c05_u104	I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
s08_e23_c05_u105	Okay, what's up?
s08_e23_c05_u106	I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it. (She holds up an engagement ring.)
s08_e23_c05_u107	Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
s08_e23_c05_u108	This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
s08_e23_c05_u109	Mom no, come on! Thank you.
s08_e23_c05_u110	Just hear me out!
s08_e23_c05_u111	N-no! Okay? We've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?
s08_e23_c05_u112	Honestly! Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
s08_e23_c05_u113	Mom, y'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry
s08_e23_c05_u114	Just-think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
s08_e23_c05_u115	Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters the hallway.)
s08_e23_c05_u116	Hi!
s08_e23_c05_u117	Oh hi dear!
s08_e23_c05_u118	Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
s08_e23_c06_u119	she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
s08_e23_c06_u120	Yeah. (Pause) Why aren't you with Rachel?
s08_e23_c06_u121	Are you kidding? Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having a baby. Okay?
s08_e23_c06_u122	But y'know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
s08_e23_c06_u123	Okay, stop it! I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
s08_e23_c06_u124	Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)
s08_e23_c06_u125	God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?
s08_e23_c06_u126	I know!
s08_e23_c06_u127	I mean seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn't and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and- (Realizes everyone is staring.) I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
s08_e23_c07_u128	(To Rachel) Hey. Who's that?
s08_e23_c07_u129	New people.
s08_e23_c07_u130	What happened to the Disgustingtons?
s08_e23_c07_u131	They're having their baby! It's not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
s08_e23_c07_u132	Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
s08_e23_c07_u133	Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
s08_e23_c07_u134	Yeah? Okay.
s08_e23_c07_u135	Ooh! Ow!!
s08_e23_c07_u136	Are you looking at her?!
s08_e23_c07_u137	No!
s08_e23_c07_u138	Don't you look at her you sick bastard!
s08_e23_c07_u139	Honey I swear! I wasn't looking at her!
s08_e23_c07_u140	She's in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
s08_e23_c07_u141	Umm. Umm, I'm-I'm just gonna-(Closes the privacy screen.)
s08_e23_c07_u142	See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
s08_e23_c07_u143	No-no, I'm-I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)
s08_e23_c07_u144	You miss your girlfriend?
s08_e23_c07_u145	Just ignore them.
s08_e23_c07_u146	Ross.
s08_e23_c07_u147	What? What?
s08_e23_c07_u148	He's looking at me.
s08_e23_c07_u149	(to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
s08_e23_c07_u150	Don't you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
s08_e23_c08_u151	Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
s08_e23_c08_u152	What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
s08_e23_c08_u153	I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
s08_e23_c08_u154	What?
s08_e23_c08_u155	Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good.
s08_e23_c08_u156	We are pretty good.
s08_e23_c08_u157	But nothing has to happen until your ready.
s08_e23_c08_u158	Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
s08_e23_c08_u159	What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
s08_e23_c08_u160	What?!!
s08_e23_c08_u161	I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
s08_e23_c08_u162	So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
s08_e23_c08_u163	We're trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler stops it.) Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
s08_e23_c08_u164	Okay, hold on a sec.
s08_e23_c08_u165	Period math?
s08_e23_c08_u166	Yeah.
s08_e23_c08_u167	Yeah.
s08_e23_c08_u168	Well, we could start trying. Now.
s08_e23_c08_u169	Right here?
s08_e23_c08_u170	No, not here. Maybe here.
s08_e23_c08_u171	Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!
s08_e23_c08_u172	And it's so clean!!
s08_e23_c09_u173	Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
s08_e23_c09_u174	Oh, it ate your money?
s08_e23_c09_u175	(looking at her) No.
s08_e23_c09_u176	All right, I'll see you downstairs then.
s08_e23_c09_u177	All right.
s08_e23_c09_u178	All right.
s08_e23_c09_u179	Hey I got one! I got one!
s08_e23_c09_u180	Hi!
s08_e23_c09_u181	Hi.
s08_e23_c09_u182	Oh uh, up or down?
s08_e23_c09_u183	Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can't.) I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)
s08_e23_c09_u184	Could you press up too please?
s08_e23_c09_u185	Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
s08_e23_c09_u186	Oh yeah? How'd yours happen?
s08_e23_c09_u187	Well, it's a long story. It's kind of embarrassing. Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about you?
s08_e23_c09_u188	Car accident.
s08_e23_c09_u189	Oh.
s08_e23_c09_u190	Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
s08_e23_c09_u191	Yeah. Me. (The elevator door opens.) Oh hey, that's me. (Rolls onto the elevator.) Hey uh, I take it you're just visiting someone.
s08_e23_c09_u192	Uh-huh, yeah.
s08_e23_c09_u193	Well umm, if you have sometime y'know and maybe you might want to visit someone else
s08_e23_c09_u194	Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
s08_e23_c09_u195	I'm in the middle- (The elevator door closes, cutting him off.)
s08_e23_c09_u196	Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
s08_e23_c09_u197	(standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)
s08_e23_c10_u198	The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
s08_e23_c10_u199	Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some support.)
s08_e23_c10_u200	That's it. That's it.
s08_e23_c10_u201	Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
s08_e23_c10_u202	Yeah it was.
s08_e23_c10_u203	Mine haven't been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. (Hums then squeals a little bit.) Oh, that was a big one!
s08_e23_c11_u204	(to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
s08_e23_c11_u205	I think I know who you're talking about.
s08_e23_c11_u206	Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
s08_e23_c11_u207	I'm sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
s08_e23_c11_u208	(walks up) Uh, she's with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.
s08_e23_c11_u209	Dr. Drake who?
s08_e23_c11_u210	Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.
s08_e23_c11_u211	A doctor at this hospital?
s08_e23_c11_u212	Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
s08_e23_c11_u213	Hands.
s08_e23_c11_u214	Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
s08_e23_c11_u215	He's in room 816.
s08_e23_c11_u216	816, thank you!
s08_e23_c11_u217	Thank you. (Starts to exit.)
s08_e23_c11_u218	And what is his name?
s08_e23_c11_u219	(coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)
s08_e23_c12_u220	I think we found a place.
s08_e23_c12_u221	Okay. (They start kissing.)
s08_e23_c12_u222	Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
s08_e23_c12_u223	Okay. Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds it's not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)
s08_e23_c12_u224	Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
s08_e23_c12_u225	Okay. Let's hurry-Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at her.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)
s08_e23_c12_u226	Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
s08_e23_c13_u227	Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that's him! That's him!
s08_e23_c13_u228	Great! Go get him.
s08_e23_c13_u229	Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
s08_e23_c13_u230	(looks in the window) He's not really my type.
s08_e23_c13_u231	No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.
s08_e23_c13_u232	But you said he was this great guy!
s08_e23_c13_u233	But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
s08_e23_c13_u234	You do attract some stinkers.
s08_e23_c14_u235	Dr. Long, I've been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
s08_e23_c14_u236	Three.
s08_e23_c14_u237	Just three?! I'm dilated three!
s08_e23_c14_u238	We are moving along, just slowly. (Rachel lies back and sighs.) Don't worry, you're doing great. I'll be back soon. (Exits.)
s08_e23_c14_u239	Hey, y'know what? I'm not waiting! I'm gonna push this baby out! I'm doing it! I mean it's what? Three centimeters? That's gotta be like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)
s08_e23_c14_u240	Actually it's more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch apart.)
s08_e23_c14_u241	Oh stupid metric system!
s08_e23_c14_u242	Oh my. We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
s08_e23_c14_u243	Oh for the love of God!
s08_e23_c14_u244	(yelling from the hallway) It's coming! It's coming!
s08_e23_c14_u245	And here it is! (The baby cries.)
s08_e23_c14_u246	Oh come on!!
s08_e23_c15_u247	Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
s08_e23_c15_u248	Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
s08_e23_c15_u249	I know, but I'm a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
s08_e23_c15_u250	Dr. Wells is a woman.
s08_e23_c15_u251	That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
s08_e23_c15_u252	Clifford Burnett.
s08_e23_c15_u253	Date of birth?
s08_e23_c15_u254	November 16th, 1968.
s08_e23_c15_u255	Age?
s08_e23_c15_u256	Can't you figure that out based on my date of birth?
s08_e23_c15_u257	I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
s08_e23_c15_u258	I'm 33.
s08_e23_c15_u259	Okay. And uh, are you married.
s08_e23_c15_u260	No.
s08_e23_c15_u261	Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
s08_e23_c15_u262	Are all the questions this personal?
s08_e23_c15_u263	(checking the list) Yes.
s08_e23_c15_u264	Well uh if you must know I'm a widower.
s08_e23_c15_u265	Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
s08_e23_c15_u266	Yeah.
s08_e23_c15_u267	Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
s08_e23_c15_u268	No.
s08_e23_c15_u269	Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?
s08_e23_c15_u270	No!
s08_e23_c15_u271	Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)
s08_e23_c16_u272	(calling to the woman) This room's available.
s08_e23_c16_u273	Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I'm next! It's my turn! It's only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you! Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross) he's a lawyer!
s08_e23_c16_u274	Uh Rach
s08_e23_c16_u275	Go get back on that case honey!
s08_e23_c16_u276	I don't think the next patient is very far along.
s08_e23_c16_u277	Okay, well then bring her in.
s08_e23_c16_u278	OH-.MY-.GAWD!!! (Uh-huh, it's Janice.)
s08_e23_c17_u279	I-.can't-.believe this!
s08_e23_c17_u280	And yet somehow it's true!
s08_e23_c17_u281	I mean this is so great! We're gonna be baby buddies! (Does the laugh.)
s08_e23_c17_u282	(To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears!
s08_e23_c17_u283	(entering, carrying a pillow) Hi sweetie!
s08_e23_c17_u284	Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office. Thank God for adult acne huh? (Does the laugh.)
s08_e23_c17_u285	I still can't believe it! I'm the luckiest guy in the world!
s08_e23_c17_u286	(softly) Really?
s08_e23_c17_u287	(To Janice) What'd he say?
s08_e23_c17_u288	Oh y'know what? You have to speak very loudly when you're talking to Sid, because he's almost completely deaf.
s08_e23_c17_u289	Oh!
s08_e23_c17_u290	Oh there you go!
s08_e23_c17_u291	I get it!
s08_e23_c17_u292	So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.
s08_e23_c17_u293	Oh we-we didn't.
s08_e23_c17_u294	No-no. We
s08_e23_c17_u295	What?!
s08_e23_c17_u296	Um uh-We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all.
s08_e23_c17_u297	Why?!!
s08_e23_c17_u298	Uh well umm-we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this.
s08_e23_c17_u299	Oh. Well then shut me up. (Does the laugh.)
s08_e23_c17_u300	Just tell me how.
s08_e23_c17_u301	Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. (She makes a sound like a goose during the contraction.)
s08_e23_c17_u302	Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
s08_e23_c18_u303	What else? What else?
s08_e23_c18_u304	Uh, well he's 33.
s08_e23_c18_u305	Oh. Ah-uh.
s08_e23_c18_u306	A widower.
s08_e23_c18_u307	Oh.
s08_e23_c18_u308	He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually.
s08_e23_c18_u309	Enter Pheebs.
s08_e23_c19_u310	Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
s08_e23_c19_u311	We could, or we can have sex in it.
s08_e23_c19_u312	Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
s08_e23_c19_u313	(lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!
s08_e23_c19_u314	Does that sound like Janice?
s08_e23_c19_u315	If it's not, then there's two of them. And that would mean it's the end of the world!
s08_e23_c20_u316	Hey!
s08_e23_c20_u317	Hey!
s08_e23_c20_u318	Hi.
s08_e23_c20_u319	Oh hi.
s08_e23_c20_u320	I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
s08_e23_c20_u321	Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
s08_e23_c20_u322	Weirdest thing. Did I hear-(A nurse opens the privacy screen and Chandler sees Janice)-Mother of God it's true!
s08_e23_c20_u323	Chandler Bing!
s08_e23_c20_u324	Jan-Janice!
s08_e23_c20_u325	Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
s08_e23_c20_u326	Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
s08_e23_c20_u327	Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
s08_e23_c20_u328	It's you. This is yours.
s08_e23_c20_u329	What?!
s08_e23_c20_u330	(laughs) Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years! (Laughs again.)
s08_e23_c20_u331	That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
s08_e23_c21_u332	Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
s08_e23_c21_u333	I'd have to say-the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you're making me eat him.
s08_e23_c21_u334	Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it? I'm sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)
s08_e23_c21_u335	No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.
s08_e23_c21_u336	Oh, I'll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)
s08_e23_c21_u337	Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
s08_e23_c21_u338	Relax, it's not like we're forking.
s08_e23_c22_u339	Oh that's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?
s08_e23_c22_u340	Y'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
s08_e23_c22_u341	Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another contraction as Dr. Long enters.)
s08_e23_c22_u342	Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
s08_e23_c22_u343	Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
s08_e23_c22_u344	Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
s08_e23_c22_u345	What?
s08_e23_c22_u346	Ten centimeters, you're about to become a mom.
s08_e23_c22_u347	My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
s08_e23_c23_u348	Is this the same spoon that was in my cast? (Smells it.)
s08_e23_c23_u349	Y'know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as Cliff sees something on TV.)
s08_e23_c23_u350	Oh my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before!
s08_e23_c23_u351	Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
s08_e23_c23_u352	I'm telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!
s08_e23_c23_u353	Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
s08_e23_c23_u354	(entering) Rachel's having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at him.) Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
s08_e23_c23_u355	That-that's him! You know him?
s08_e23_c23_u356	Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm-this-I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
s08_e23_c23_u357	I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
s08_e23_c23_u358	Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)
s08_e23_c23_u359	And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
s08_e23_c23_u360	You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
s08_e23_c23_u361	I don't think so.
s08_e23_c23_u362	Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
s08_e23_c23_u363	Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
s08_e23_c23_u364	Right!
s08_e23_c23_u365	Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
s08_e23_c23_u366	It doesn't happen to me either.
s08_e23_c23_u367	Me neither.
s08_e23_c24_u368	Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5-4
s08_e23_c24_u369	3-2-1 oh!!
s08_e23_c24_u370	Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.
s08_e23_c24_u371	I can't. I can't push anymore, I can't.
s08_e23_c24_u372	Sweetie you're doing great.
s08_e23_c24_u373	Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
s08_e23_c24_u374	Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
s08_e23_c24_u375	What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!
s08_e23_c24_u376	Don't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
s08_e23_c24_u377	What is that?
s08_e23_c24_u378	It's the baby's buttock, she's breech.
s08_e23_c24_u379	Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
s08_e23_c24_u380	Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
s08_e23_c24_u381	She's gonna be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you're gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
s08_e23_c24_u382	Go!
s08_e23_c24_u383	Rachel you're gonna have to push even harder, nothing's happening!
s08_e23_c24_u384	I'm sorry, I can't!
s08_e23_c24_u385	Yes you can!
s08_e23_c24_u386	I can't!
s08_e23_c24_u387	Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let's go!
s08_e23_c24_u388	I can't. Please, you do it for me.
s08_e23_c24_u389	No! Come on let's-One more time! One final push! Ready? 1-2-3! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking him down.)
s08_e23_c24_u390	Good!
s08_e23_c24_u391	(from the floor) Keep pushing!
s08_e23_c24_u392	Are you okay?
s08_e23_c24_u393	You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!
s08_e23_c24_u394	Here we go!
s08_e23_c24_u395	Oh! Oh! She's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
s08_e23_c24_u396	Oh God!
s08_e23_c24_u397	Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she's here.
s08_e23_c24_u398	Oh she's-she's perfect.
s08_e23_c24_u399	Oh, she's so tiny. (Starts crying) Where'd she go?
s08_e23_c24_u400	Oh it's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
s08_e23_c24_u401	Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.
s08_e23_c24_u402	Here she is!
s08_e23_c24_u403	Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you.
s08_e23_c24_u404	Do we have a name yet?
s08_e23_c24_u405	No, not yet.
s08_e23_c24_u406	That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
s08_e23_c24_u407	Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
s08_e23_c24_u408	Hello baby girl.
s08_e23_c25_u409	Can we come in?
s08_e23_c25_u410	Oh, come in.
s08_e23_c25_u411	Hi!
s08_e23_c25_u412	There she is!
s08_e23_c25_u413	Oh, she's so beautiful.
s08_e23_c25_u414	Here. (Hands her to Monica.)
s08_e23_c25_u415	Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
s08_e23_c25_u416	It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
s08_e23_c25_u417	(taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Y'know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and-uh-oh.
s08_e23_c25_u418	What?
s08_e23_c25_u419	Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good.
s08_e23_c25_u420	Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won't.
s08_e23_c25_u421	What's the matter?
s08_e23_c25_u422	Oh nothing I- Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
s08_e23_c25_u423	The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.
s08_e23_c25_u424	So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)
s08_e23_c25_u425	What's the matter now?
s08_e23_c25_u426	I was reliving it.
s08_e23_c25_u427	Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)
s08_e23_c25_u428	So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
s08_e23_c25_u429	Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
s08_e23_c25_u430	Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names.
s08_e23_c25_u431	Yeah, and y'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.
s08_e23_c25_u432	Wow! Umm, okay uh-everyone-this-is Isabella. (Rachel starts crying.) What?
s08_e23_c25_u433	That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
s08_e23_c25_u434	So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
s08_e23_c25_u435	What was the other one Ross?
s08_e23_c25_u436	Umm, Delilah.
s08_e23_c25_u437	Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
s08_e23_c25_u438	So I guess we're back to uh, Baby Girl.
s08_e23_c25_u439	Yay!
s08_e23_c25_u440	Well what are we going to do?
s08_e23_c25_u441	It's okay honey, you'll find a name.
s08_e23_c25_u442	Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
s08_e23_c25_u443	You do?
s08_e23_c25_u444	Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.
s08_e23_c25_u445	Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?
s08_e23_c25_u446	Well tell us! What are they?
s08_e23_c25_u447	Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel.
s08_e23_c25_u448	And if it's a girl?
s08_e23_c25_u449	I don't want to say.
s08_e23_c25_u450	Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
s08_e23_c25_u451	Okay. It's Emma.
s08_e23_c25_u452	(gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don't want it.
s08_e23_c25_u453	Take it.
s08_e23_c25_u454	What?
s08_e23_c25_u455	It's clearly an Emma.
s08_e23_c25_u456	Oh honey, but you love that name.
s08_e23_c25_u457	Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed. I mean- (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that's you. You're our little Em. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!
s08_e23_c26_u458	That was amazing.
s08_e23_c26_u459	I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
s08_e23_c26_u460	And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
s08_e23_c27_u461	(entering) Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
s08_e23_c27_u462	Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
s08_e23_c27_u463	He's a keeper. How are you feeling?
s08_e23_c27_u464	Oh, I'm fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)
s08_e23_c27_u465	Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone.
s08_e23_c27_u466	Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
s08_e23_c27_u467	Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
s08_e23_c27_u468	Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
s08_e23_c27_u469	I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.
s08_e23_c27_u470	Well I-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
s08_e23_c27_u471	Oh well that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
s08_e23_c27_u472	Really?
s08_e23_c27_u473	I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are on your own.
s08_e23_c27_u474	Well- That's-y'know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, cause lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the-the beginning of something.
s08_e23_c27_u475	(entering) Hey Janice!
s08_e23_c27_u476	Oh hi!
s08_e23_c27_u477	Who's this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)
s08_e23_c27_u478	Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
s08_e23_c27_u479	No-no. No.
s08_e23_c27_u480	I'm gonna leave the three of you alone.
s08_e23_c27_u481	Okay.
s08_e23_c27_u482	Bye. (Exits.)
s08_e23_c27_u483	Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
s08_e23_c27_u484	Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?
s08_e23_c27_u485	Huh?
s08_e23_c27_u486	Umm-that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
s08_e23_c27_u487	Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we-we gotta be careful. We-we can't let that happen again, y'know?
s08_e23_c27_u488	(pause) Right.
s08_e23_c27_u489	I mean we don't want to go down that road do we?
s08_e23_c27_u490	No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. (Pause) They didn't have any sodas?
s08_e23_c27_u491	Oh my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
s08_e23_c27_u492	That's all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.
s08_e23_c28_u493	Is she in there?
s08_e23_c28_u494	Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her. (Points to the nurse putting Emma now.)
s08_e23_c28_u495	Oh!
s08_e23_c28_u496	Look at Emma!
s08_e23_c28_u497	I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
s08_e23_c28_u498	Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
s08_e23_c28_u499	I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
s08_e23_c28_u500	It's-it's complicated okay?
s08_e23_c28_u501	Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
s08_e23_c28_u502	Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out-I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything-(Starts to cry.) Oh that's-now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
s08_e23_c28_u503	I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
s08_e23_c28_u504	Yeah, exactly.
s08_e23_c28_u505	Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
s08_e23_c29_u506	Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. (Notices she's wiping her eyes.) What's the matter?
s08_e23_c29_u507	Nothing.
s08_e23_c29_u508	What is it? Hey!
s08_e23_c29_u509	Really it's nothing. I'm just
s08_e23_c29_u510	Rach come on, what?
s08_e23_c29_u511	I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
s08_e23_c29_u512	What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
s08_e23_c29_u513	Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
s08_e23_c29_u514	Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
s08_e23_c29_u515	I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and-he's gonna have his own life. Right?
s08_e23_c29_u516	Yeah, I guess so.
s08_e23_c29_u517	I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
s08_e23_c29_u518	Hey, listen to me, listen to me-you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.
s08_e23_c29_u519	Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
s08_e23_c29_u520	You don't have to worry about that okay?
s08_e23_c29_u521	Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They're right on that chair under Ross's coat.
s08_e23_c29_u522	Sure.
s08_e23_c29_u523	Okay.
s08_e23_c29_u524	My God.
s08_e23_c29_u525	Joey.
s08_e23_c29_u526	(seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
s01_e18_c01_u001	Hey, guys.
s01_e18_c01_u002	Hey.
s01_e18_c01_u003	Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? (to Monica, quietly): Did you bring the mail?
s01_e18_c01_u004	Lots of responses.
s01_e18_c01_u005	(to Monica): Really? (out loud): Sure, we have scones left! (to Monica): OK, read them to me.
s01_e18_c01_u006	(reading): Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... (crumples up letter)
s01_e18_c01_u007	(out loud): We have apple cinnamon...
s01_e18_c01_u008	(reading): OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. (crumpes up letter)
s01_e18_c01_u009	Wow!
s01_e18_c01_u010	What?
s01_e18_c01_u011	(reading): Your Visa bill is huge!
s01_e18_c01_u012	(grabs the bill) Give me that!
s01_e18_c01_u013	You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
s01_e18_c01_u014	I don't know.
s01_e18_c01_u015	Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
s01_e18_c01_u016	No, it's not just that. It's just-I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at Rachel)
s01_e18_c01_u017	...little playthings with yarn?
s01_e18_c01_u018	What?
s01_e18_c01_u019	Could you want her more?
s01_e18_c01_u020	Who?
s01_e18_c01_u021	(sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
s01_e18_c01_u022	Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... (Rachel comes over, Ross lays head on table): Hiiii!
s01_e18_c01_u023	Hi! How are you?
s01_e18_c01_u024	We're fine, we're fine.
s01_e18_c01_u025	OK. (walks away)
s01_e18_c01_u026	Shut up!
s01_e18_c01_u027	We're not-we're not saying anything.
s01_e18_c01_u028	What?
s01_e18_c01_u029	Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
s01_e18_c01_u030	Thank you.
s01_e18_c01_u031	(to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...
s01_e18_c01_u032	There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
s01_e18_c01_u033	Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
s01_e18_c01_u034	And then he did.
s01_e18_c01_u035	Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
s01_e18_c01_u036	Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
s01_e18_c01_u037	No, women are welcome to play.
s01_e18_c01_u038	Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
s01_e18_c01_u039	There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
s01_e18_c01_u040	Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
s01_e18_c01_u041	Oh, yeah, right.
s01_e18_c01_u042	Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
s01_e18_c01_u043	Really.
s01_e18_c01_u044	I mean, that's a typical guy response.
s01_e18_c01_u045	Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
s01_e18_c01_u046	No.
s01_e18_c01_u047	But you could teach us.
s01_e18_c01_u048	No.
s01_e18_c02_u049	(teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.
s01_e18_c02_u050	So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
s01_e18_c02_u051	Oh, good for you!
s01_e18_c02_u052	Congratulations!
s01_e18_c02_u053	OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
s01_e18_c02_u054	OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
s01_e18_c02_u055	No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't-you can't do...
s01_e18_c02_u056	Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here! (gives it to Phoebe)
s01_e18_c02_u057	Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
s01_e18_c02_u058	Oh, you're... (gives up)
s01_e18_c02_u059	Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
s01_e18_c02_u060	OOooooo!
s01_e18_c02_u061	Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)
s01_e18_c02_u062	(changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...
s01_e18_c02_u063	Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
s01_e18_c02_u064	Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
s01_e18_c02_u065	But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
s01_e18_c02_u066	OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the cards.
s01_e18_c02_u067	(throws down her cards) Dammit, dammit, dammit!
s01_e18_c02_u068	(to Joey): Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
s01_e18_c02_u069	About what?
s01_e18_c02_u070	About how good your cards were.
s01_e18_c02_u071	Heh... I was bluffing.
s01_e18_c02_u072	A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
s01_e18_c02_u073	OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)
s01_e18_c02_u074	Whoa, whoa, whoa!
s01_e18_c02_u075	Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
s01_e18_c02_u076	Settle what?
s01_e18_c02_u077	The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
s01_e18_c02_u078	The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
s01_e18_c02_u079	Oh. Right.
s01_e18_c02_u080	You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
s01_e18_c02_u081	Hell no, we'll pay!
s01_e18_c02_u082	OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
s01_e18_c02_u083	And you know what? We want a rematch.
s01_e18_c02_u084	Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
s01_e18_c02_u085	(to Ross): So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
s01_e18_c02_u086	(pause)...Yeah.
s01_e18_c02_u087	Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
s01_e18_c02_u088	Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)
s01_e18_c02_u089	(pause)...Yeah?
s01_e18_c02_u090	I'm not a nice guy.
s01_e18_c03_u091	Alright boys, let's eat.
s01_e18_c03_u092	Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
s01_e18_c03_u093	You still on that?
s01_e18_c03_u094	Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking): "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
s01_e18_c03_u095	You are way off, pal.
s01_e18_c03_u096	No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
s01_e18_c03_u097	Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time-not any more. I just-I...
s01_e18_c03_u098	Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
s01_e18_c03_u099	You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK-if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
s01_e18_c04_u100	(opening mail) Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
s01_e18_c04_u101	Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
s01_e18_c04_u102	Ha. Ha, ha.
s01_e18_c04_u103	What?
s01_e18_c04_u104	Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
s01_e18_c04_u105	Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
s01_e18_c04_u106	Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
s01_e18_c04_u107	That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
s01_e18_c04_u108	Oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised): Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
s01_e18_c04_u109	You're kidding! Where? Where?
s01_e18_c04_u110	(in disbelief): Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
s01_e18_c04_u111	Oh, Rachel!
s01_e18_c04_u112	Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
s01_e18_c04_u113	Well, what's the job?
s01_e18_c04_u114	Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
s01_e18_c04_u115	OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. (opens door) Hi!
s01_e18_c04_u116	Is Tony Randall dead?
s01_e18_c04_u117	No.
s01_e18_c04_u118	I don't think so.
s01_e18_c04_u119	Why?
s01_e18_c04_u120	Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
s01_e18_c04_u121	What?
s01_e18_c04_u122	Oh my God!
s01_e18_c04_u123	Really?
s01_e18_c04_u124	No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. (walks into kitchen) Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. (to Phoebe): Nice earrings.
s01_e18_c04_u125	Thank y... (thinks about it)
s01_e18_c04_u126	Girls, sit down.
s01_e18_c04_u127	Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
s01_e18_c04_u128	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.
s01_e18_c05_u129	Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
s01_e18_c05_u130	Alright.
s01_e18_c05_u131	I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
s01_e18_c05_u132	Hi!
s01_e18_c05_u133	Hey.
s01_e18_c05_u134	Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
s01_e18_c05_u135	Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
s01_e18_c05_u136	Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and-oh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
s01_e18_c05_u137	That's great! That's wonderful!
s01_e18_c05_u138	Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
s01_e18_c05_u139	OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
s01_e18_c05_u140	Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
s01_e18_c05_u141	Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
s01_e18_c05_u142	Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
s01_e18_c05_u143	Yes, we should. I think we should.
s01_e18_c05_u144	Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
s01_e18_c05_u145	No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go.
s01_e18_c05_u146	Alright.
s01_e18_c05_u147	Alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)
s01_e18_c06_u148	So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
s01_e18_c06_u149	But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
s01_e18_c06_u150	Alright, here's my $7.50. (Hands them the money) But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
s01_e18_c06_u151	What?
s01_e18_c06_u152	Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
s01_e18_c06_u153	That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
s01_e18_c06_u154	Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
s01_e18_c06_u155	Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)
s01_e18_c06_u156	You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
s01_e18_c06_u157	Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.
s01_e18_c07_u158	So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
s01_e18_c07_u159	Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
s01_e18_c07_u160	OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
s01_e18_c07_u161	(holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker.
s01_e18_c07_u162	Excuse me, where are you going?
s01_e18_c07_u163	Uh... to the bathroom.
s01_e18_c07_u164	Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
s01_e18_c07_u165	I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
s01_e18_c07_u166	Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)
s01_e18_c07_u167	Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
s01_e18_c07_u168	That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
s01_e18_c07_u169	Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)
s01_e18_c07_u170	(looks at her cards) Yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
s01_e18_c07_u171	Alright. (to Rachel): Your money's mine, Green.
s01_e18_c07_u172	Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)
s01_e18_c07_u173	You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
s01_e18_c07_u174	Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
s01_e18_c07_u175	Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
s01_e18_c07_u176	Yeah. Um... I'm out. (throws in cards)
s01_e18_c07_u177	I'm in.
s01_e18_c07_u178	Me too.
s01_e18_c07_u179	Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
s01_e18_c07_u180	Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. (lays down cards)
s01_e18_c07_u181	Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays down cards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and I think-oh-that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing): Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
s01_e18_c07_u182	And your fly's still open...
s01_e18_c07_u183	Ha, I made you look....
s01_e18_c07_u184	I couldn't be inner. Monica?
s01_e18_c07_u185	Monica, in or out?
s01_e18_c07_u186	(slams down cards) I hate this game!
s01_e18_c07_u187	OK Joey, your bet.
s01_e18_c07_u188	Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out.
s01_e18_c07_u189	Ross?
s01_e18_c07_u190	Oh, I am very in.
s01_e18_c07_u191	Chandler?
s01_e18_c07_u192	Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
s01_e18_c07_u193	Me too. Rachel.
s01_e18_c07_u194	Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What do you say... want to waste another buck?
s01_e18_c07_u195	No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?
s01_e18_c07_u196	I'm not telling. (collects chips)
s01_e18_c07_u197	Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)
s01_e18_c07_u198	No..!
s01_e18_c07_u199	Show them to me!
s01_e18_c07_u200	Get your hands out of there! No!
s01_e18_c07_u201	Let me see! Show them!
s01_e18_c07_u202	Y'know, I've had dates like this.
s01_e18_c07_u203	(deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
s01_e18_c07_u204	Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
s01_e18_c07_u205	First of all, I'm not losing...
s01_e18_c07_u206	Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)
s01_e18_c07_u207	Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
s01_e18_c07_u208	(answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
s01_e18_c07_u209	(mimicking Rachel) Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
s01_e18_c07_u210	(on phone) Excuse me. (covers up phone; to Ross) It's about the job.
s01_e18_c07_u211	Barbara! Hi, how are you? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea-Hello? Hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)
s01_e18_c07_u212	Sorry, Rach.
s01_e18_c07_u213	Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
s01_e18_c07_u214	Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
s01_e18_c07_u215	Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
s01_e18_c07_u216	Yes, we do. (pause)
s01_e18_c07_u217	Alright, check.
s01_e18_c07_u218	Check.
s01_e18_c07_u219	I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)
s01_e18_c07_u220	Call.
s01_e18_c07_u221	I'm in.
s01_e18_c07_u222	I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws it in)
s01_e18_c07_u223	I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
s01_e18_c07_u224	Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
s01_e18_c07_u225	(to Ross): Loser?
s01_e18_c07_u226	No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)
s01_e18_c07_u227	What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
s01_e18_c07_u228	I'm in. (throws in chips)
s01_e18_c07_u229	How many you want?
s01_e18_c07_u230	One. (Rachel gives him the card.)
s01_e18_c07_u231	Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?
s01_e18_c07_u232	I bet two dollars. (throws it in)
s01_e18_c07_u233	OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)
s01_e18_c07_u234	I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)
s01_e18_c07_u235	See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
s01_e18_c07_u236	Rachel, there's nothing in it.
s01_e18_c07_u237	OK, then get me your purse.
s01_e18_c07_u238	OK, here you go. Good luck.
s01_e18_c07_u239	(to Monica): Thank you. (to Ross): I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.
s01_e18_c07_u240	...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)
s01_e18_c07_u241	(to Joey): Joey, I'm a little shy.
s01_e18_c07_u242	That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
s01_e18_c07_u243	(to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?
s01_e18_c07_u244	Fifteen.
s01_e18_c07_u245	Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)
s01_e18_c07_u246	Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)
s01_e18_c07_u247	Thank you.
s01_e18_c07_u248	Good luck.
s01_e18_c07_u249	(to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
s01_e18_c07_u250	(lays down cards) Full house.
s01_e18_c07_u251	You got me.
s01_e18_c07_u252	(to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
s01_e18_c07_u253	(to Ross): I thought we had them!
s01_e18_c07_u254	Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)
s01_e18_c08_u255	Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
s01_e18_c08_u256	Oh, time's up.
s01_e18_c08_u257	(pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
s01_e18_c08_u258	Oh!
s01_e18_c08_u259	That's a bird?
s01_e18_c08_u260	That's a bird!
s01_e18_c08_u261	OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)
s01_e18_c08_u262	Go.
s01_e18_c08_u263	Uh.... bean! Bean!
s01_e18_c08_u264	(triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
s01_e18_c08_u265	Yes!
s01_e18_c08_u266	That, you get? That, you get?
s04_e17_c01_u001	Ohhh, man!!
s04_e17_c01_u002	(coming in from his bedroom) What is that?
s04_e17_c01_u003	Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
s04_e17_c01_u004	What in the name of hell?
s04_e17_c01_u005	Maybe he found you flip-flop.
s04_e17_c01_u006	Hey!
s04_e17_c01_u007	Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
s04_e17_c01_u008	Do we pay for this?
s04_e17_c01_u009	No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
s04_e17_c01_u010	Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
s04_e17_c01_u011	Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he just said.)
s04_e17_c01_u012	(coming in from the bathroom) Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
s04_e17_c01_u013	Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
s04_e17_c01_u014	Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
s04_e17_c01_u015	Like finding money with naked people on it!
s04_e17_c01_u016	Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad. (Exits.)
s04_e17_c01_u017	(to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)
s04_e17_c02_u018	All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)
s04_e17_c02_u019	We don't know what could make this go away.
s04_e17_c02_u020	Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
s04_e17_c02_u021	And no one touches the air around the TV!
s04_e17_c02_u022	Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
s04_e17_c02_u023	Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
s04_e17_c02_u024	We still have porn.
s04_e17_c02_u025	Hey.
s04_e17_c02_u026	(entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!
s04_e17_c02_u027	Hi!
s04_e17_c02_u028	Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
s04_e17_c02_u029	Yeah.
s04_e17_c02_u030	Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)
s04_e17_c02_u031	Okay.
s04_e17_c02_u032	Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She goes over and stands in front of the TV.)
s04_e17_c02_u033	Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
s04_e17_c02_u034	You mean like a doctor?
s04_e17_c02_u035	Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
s04_e17_c02_u036	Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
s04_e17_c03_u037	Hi.
s04_e17_c03_u038	Hi.
s04_e17_c03_u039	So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
s04_e17_c03_u040	Oh. Why didn't you take her?
s04_e17_c03_u041	Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so
s04_e17_c03_u042	You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
s04_e17_c03_u043	(Thinks about it.) Nah.
s04_e17_c03_u044	Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
s04_e17_c03_u045	Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy-"
s04_e17_c03_u046	(interrupting him) No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
s04_e17_c03_u047	And why do you care so much?
s04_e17_c03_u048	Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
s04_e17_c03_u049	You had fantasies about Emily?
s04_e17_c03_u050	No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
s04_e17_c03_u051	Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
s04_e17_c03_u052	Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
s04_e17_c03_u053	Ahh.
s04_e17_c03_u054	Do you love her?
s04_e17_c03_u055	We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
s04_e17_c03_u056	You love her!
s04_e17_c03_u057	What-what is love really?
s04_e17_c03_u058	Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
s04_e17_c03_u059	I am a good kisser.
s04_e17_c03_u060	Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in- (Ross looks at her.) I've been watching too much porn.
s04_e17_c04_u061	Is that the heartbeat?
s04_e17_c04_u062	That's it.
s04_e17_c04_u063	Oh my God!
s04_e17_c04_u064	Oh wow! This is so cool.
s04_e17_c04_u065	Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
s04_e17_c04_u066	Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
s04_e17_c04_u067	No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
s04_e17_c04_u068	Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
s04_e17_c04_u069	Doctors are wrong all the time.
s04_e17_c04_u070	Well, yeah.
s04_e17_c04_u071	Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
s04_e17_c04_u072	Definitely. (Points out each head on the ultrasound.)
s04_e17_c04_u073	Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
s04_e17_c04_u074	Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
s04_e17_c04_u075	What do you know?!
s04_e17_c05_u076	(entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!
s04_e17_c05_u077	Ooh! Hi!
s04_e17_c05_u078	Hi! (She runs over and hugs Phoebe's stomach.) So, how did it go at the doctors?
s04_e17_c05_u079	Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
s04_e17_c05_u080	Yes.
s04_e17_c05_u081	Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
s04_e17_c05_u082	Three babies?
s04_e17_c05_u083	I finally got my band!
s04_e17_c05_u084	We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
s04_e17_c05_u085	Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
s04_e17_c05_u086	Why would we be freaked?
s04_e17_c05_u087	No, no maybe cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and
s04_e17_c05_u088	(They're less than happy now) Oh.
s04_e17_c05_u089	Right.
s04_e17_c05_u090	No, back to happy. Back to happy!
s04_e17_c05_u091	No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
s04_e17_c05_u092	Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
s04_e17_c05_u093	No, Frank.
s04_e17_c05_u094	No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
s04_e17_c05_u095	Yeah, refrigerator college.
s04_e17_c05_u096	Yeah.
s04_e17_c05_u097	Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
s04_e17_c05_u098	You can't give up on your dream.
s04_e17_c05_u099	No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
s04_e17_c06_u100	Emily! (Runs up.)
s04_e17_c06_u101	Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)
s04_e17_c06_u102	I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
s04_e17_c06_u103	You are so sweet. (They kiss.)
s04_e17_c06_u104	That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. (She's holding one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.
s04_e17_c06_u105	Me too.
s04_e17_c06_u106	Well, that' me. (They kiss again.) Here, have this. (She gives him the candy bar.) I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. (She starts towards the jetway.)
s04_e17_c06_u107	(stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
s04_e17_c06_u108	Oh. (She's shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)
s04_e17_c06_u109	That's no problem.
s04_e17_c07_u110	What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
s04_e17_c07_u111	It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
s04_e17_c07_u112	Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
s04_e17_c07_u113	Yeah right.
s04_e17_c07_u114	No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
s04_e17_c07_u115	Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
s04_e17_c07_u116	Yes!
s04_e17_c07_u117	Yeah, he likes porn.
s04_e17_c07_u118	Where ya going?
s04_e17_c07_u119	I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!
s04_e17_c07_u120	Hey.
s04_e17_c07_u121	Hey!
s04_e17_c07_u122	How did it go with Frank and Alice?
s04_e17_c07_u123	Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
s04_e17_c07_u124	They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
s04_e17_c07_u125	Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
s04_e17_c07_u126	I did.
s04_e17_c07_u127	And well, what did she say?
s04_e17_c07_u128	Thank you.
s04_e17_c07_u129	Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
s04_e17_c07_u130	She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
s04_e17_c07_u131	Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
s04_e17_c07_u132	Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
s04_e17_c07_u133	What do I do now?
s04_e17_c07_u134	You play hard to get.
s04_e17_c07_u135	She already lives in London.
s04_e17_c07_u136	Then you go to Tokyo.
s04_e17_c07_u137	All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
s04_e17_c07_u138	It is not over! You're over!
s04_e17_c07_u139	What?
s04_e17_c07_u140	You know!
s04_e17_c07_u141	Okay. (Pause) Good one.
s04_e17_c07_u142	It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)
s04_e17_c07_u143	Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
s04_e17_c07_u144	Way to be strong, man!
s04_e17_c08_u145	Hey!
s04_e17_c08_u146	Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
s04_e17_c08_u147	Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
s04_e17_c08_u148	Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
s04_e17_c08_u149	(entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
s04_e17_c08_u150	Hey!
s04_e17_c08_u151	Hi!
s04_e17_c08_u152	Well, what-what cha got there?
s04_e17_c08_u153	Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking
s04_e17_c08_u154	Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
s04_e17_c08_u155	Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
s04_e17_c08_u156	No!
s04_e17_c08_u157	Are you sure?
s04_e17_c08_u158	No!
s04_e17_c08_u159	Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
s04_e17_c08_u160	No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
s04_e17_c08_u161	What's the second part of your plan?
s04_e17_c08_u162	My Saturn dealership.
s04_e17_c09_u163	(Answers the phone.) Hello?
s04_e17_c09_u164	Ross.
s04_e17_c09_u165	Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
s04_e17_c09_u166	It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
s04_e17_c09_u167	No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
s04_e17_c09_u168	Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
s04_e17_c09_u169	Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
s04_e17_c10_u170	She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
s04_e17_c10_u171	This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
s04_e17_c10_u172	Well
s04_e17_c10_u173	Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
s04_e17_c10_u174	I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
s04_e17_c10_u175	You put your fist through the wall?
s04_e17_c10_u176	No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
s04_e17_c10_u177	You have to go to London!
s04_e17_c10_u178	What?
s04_e17_c10_u179	Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
s04_e17_c10_u180	Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
s04_e17_c10_u181	When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
s04_e17_c10_u182	I made fun of his accent.
s04_e17_c10_u183	You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
s04_e17_c10_u184	No.
s04_e17_c10_u185	All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
s04_e17_c10_u186	Really?
s04_e17_c10_u187	Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
s04_e17_c10_u188	All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
s04_e17_c10_u189	All right.
s04_e17_c10_u190	I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
s04_e17_c10_u191	Okay, good luck!
s04_e17_c10_u192	Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)
s04_e17_c11_u193	Hey!
s04_e17_c11_u194	Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
s04_e17_c11_u195	That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
s04_e17_c11_u196	Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised
s04_e17_c11_u197	I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
s04_e17_c11_u198	Okay.
s04_e17_c11_u199	Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
s04_e17_c11_u200	A place where no one will ever get out alive?
s04_e17_c11_u201	No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's
s04_e17_c11_u202	(interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
s04_e17_c11_u203	The name was my favourite part!
s04_e17_c11_u204	Well, well I can up with it!
s04_e17_c11_u205	YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
s04_e17_c11_u206	Well, I
s04_e17_c11_u207	Hello.
s04_e17_c11_u208	(on phone) Hey.
s04_e17_c11_u209	Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
s04_e17_c11_u210	No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
s04_e17_c11_u211	All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
s04_e17_c11_u212	About four hours.
s04_e17_c11_u213	Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
s04_e17_c11_u214	Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
s04_e17_c11_u215	Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
s04_e17_c11_u216	Oh, that is better.
s04_e17_c12_u217	Are we in London?
s04_e17_c12_u218	What are you doing here? You can't be here!
s04_e17_c12_u219	I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
s04_e17_c12_u220	What?
s04_e17_c12_u221	(pause) Nothing. No, nothing.
s04_e17_c12_u222	I was going to call him, but
s04_e17_c12_u223	Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily) I'm right, right?
s04_e17_c12_u224	I'd really rather talk to him.
s04_e17_c12_u225	Oh.
s04_e17_c12_u226	I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
s04_e17_c12_u227	Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but- (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
s04_e17_c12_u228	(yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You can't hear me. (Goes to make his call.)
s04_e17_c12_u229	I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello.
s04_e17_c12_u230	Hi.
s04_e17_c12_u231	Ross, I love you!
s04_e17_c12_u232	Ohh! Thank you.
s04_e17_c13_u233	Hey.
s04_e17_c13_u234	Hey.
s04_e17_c13_u235	I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
s04_e17_c13_u236	Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
s04_e17_c13_u237	What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
s04_e17_c13_u238	Noo! Nothing!
s04_e17_c13_u239	Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
s04_e17_c13_u240	I think you're right.
s04_e17_c13_u241	All right, ready?
s04_e17_c13_u242	One.
s04_e17_c13_u243	Two.
s04_e17_c13_u244	That's kinda nice.
s04_e17_c13_u245	Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
s04_e17_c13_u246	Yeah.
s04_e17_c13_u247	You wanna see if we still have it?
s04_e17_c13_u248	Yeah.
s04_e17_c13_u249	FREE PORN!!!
s04_e17_c13_u250	Yeah!!
s04_e17_c13_u251	We have free porn here!!!
s01_e02_c01_u001	Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
s01_e02_c01_u002	Oh, yeah!
s01_e02_c01_u003	Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
s01_e02_c01_u004	Absolutely.
s01_e02_c01_u005	Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
s01_e02_c01_u006	Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
s01_e02_c01_u007	The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
s01_e02_c01_u008	Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
s01_e02_c01_u009	(pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
s01_e02_c02_u010	No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
s01_e02_c02_u011	Well, she has issues.
s01_e02_c02_u012	Does she.
s01_e02_c02_u013	He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
s01_e02_c02_u014	Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
s01_e02_c02_u015	Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
s01_e02_c02_u016	(trying to ignore her) No. No.
s01_e02_c02_u017	Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
s01_e02_c02_u018	Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
s01_e02_c02_u019	Hi.
s01_e02_c02_u020	So.
s01_e02_c02_u021	You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
s01_e02_c02_u022	Sorry. You look good too.
s01_e02_c02_u023	Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
s01_e02_c02_u024	A lesbian?
s01_e02_c02_u025	Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
s01_e02_c02_u026	Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
s01_e02_c02_u027	Why- why are you here, Carol?
s01_e02_c02_u028	I'm pregnant.
s01_e02_c02_u029	Pregnant?!
s01_e02_c03_u030	...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)
s01_e02_c03_u031	(taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
s01_e02_c03_u032	Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
s01_e02_c03_u033	Whose little ball of paper is this?!
s01_e02_c03_u034	Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
s01_e02_c03_u035	She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!
s01_e02_c03_u036	Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
s01_e02_c03_u037	Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
s01_e02_c03_u038	Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
s01_e02_c03_u039	Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
s01_e02_c03_u040	That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
s01_e02_c03_u041	(looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
s01_e02_c03_u042	What?
s01_e02_c03_u043	Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
s01_e02_c03_u044	Eeaagh!
s01_e02_c03_u045	Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
s01_e02_c03_u046	Yeah, it's beautiful.
s01_e02_c03_u047	Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)
s01_e02_c03_u048	No, look, don't touch that!
s01_e02_c03_u049	Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
s01_e02_c03_u050	Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!
s01_e02_c03_u051	You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
s01_e02_c03_u052	I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
s01_e02_c03_u053	...Dinah?
s01_e02_c03_u054	(looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
s01_e02_c03_u055	You didn't.
s01_e02_c03_u056	Oh, I am sorry...
s01_e02_c03_u057	I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)
s01_e02_c03_u058	Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
s01_e02_c03_u059	Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
s01_e02_c03_u060	(puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.
s01_e02_c03_u061	Boys? We're going in.
s01_e02_c03_u062	Wow. That is not a happy hi.
s01_e02_c03_u063	Carol's pregnant.
s01_e02_c03_u064	(while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!
s01_e02_c03_u065	W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
s01_e02_c03_u066	Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)
s01_e02_c03_u067	Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
s01_e02_c03_u068	Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
s01_e02_c03_u069	Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
s01_e02_c03_u070	She is so great! I miss her.
s01_e02_c03_u071	What does she mean by 'involved'?
s01_e02_c03_u072	I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
s01_e02_c03_u073	Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
s01_e02_c03_u074	So what are you gonna do?
s01_e02_c03_u075	I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
s01_e02_c03_u076	.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
s01_e02_c04_u077	Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste?
s01_e02_c04_u078	Curry.
s01_e02_c04_u079	Mmmm!
s01_e02_c04_u080	I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
s01_e02_c04_u081	(To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
s01_e02_c04_u082	They all had a thing for him.
s01_e02_c04_u083	Aw, Mom...
s01_e02_c04_u084	I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
s01_e02_c04_u085	Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
s01_e02_c04_u086	No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
s01_e02_c04_u087	Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)
s01_e02_c04_u088	Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
s01_e02_c04_u089	Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)
s01_e02_c04_u090	Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
s01_e02_c04_u091	I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
s01_e02_c04_u092	What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
s01_e02_c04_u093	I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
s01_e02_c04_u094	Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
s01_e02_c04_u095	What's that supposed to mean?
s01_e02_c04_u096	Nothing! It's an expression.
s01_e02_c04_u097	No it's not.
s01_e02_c04_u098	Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
s01_e02_c04_u099	...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
s01_e02_c04_u100	(trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
s01_e02_c04_u101	(pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
s01_e02_c04_u102	(To Monica) And you knew about this?!
s01_e02_c05_u103	Your folks are really that bad, huh?
s01_e02_c05_u104	Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
s01_e02_c05_u105	Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.
s01_e02_c05_u106	Must pee. (Goes to pee.)
s01_e02_c05_u107	Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
s01_e02_c05_u108	You're twins?
s01_e02_c05_u109	Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
s01_e02_c05_u110	What does she do?
s01_e02_c05_u111	She's a waitress.
s01_e02_c05_u112	All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)
s01_e02_c05_u113	Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
s01_e02_c05_u114	Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
s01_e02_c05_u115	The lights, please..
s01_e02_c05_u116	...How long was I in there?
s01_e02_c05_u117	I'm just cleaning up.
s01_e02_c05_u118	D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
s01_e02_c05_u119	Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)
s01_e02_c05_u120	Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
s01_e02_c05_u121	Oh.. a little..
s01_e02_c05_u122	Mm-hmm..
s01_e02_c05_u123	A lot.
s01_e02_c05_u124	Mm.
s01_e02_c05_u125	So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
s01_e02_c05_u126	Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
s01_e02_c05_u127	Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
s01_e02_c05_u128	Got me.
s01_e02_c05_u129	Remember when we were in high school together?
s01_e02_c05_u130	Yeah.
s01_e02_c05_u131	I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?
s01_e02_c05_u132	Yes, yes!
s01_e02_c05_u133	Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)
s01_e02_c05_u134	Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)
s01_e02_c06_u135	(entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
s01_e02_c06_u136	Hi.
s01_e02_c06_u137	Ross, you remember Susan.
s01_e02_c06_u138	How could I forget?
s01_e02_c06_u139	Ross.
s01_e02_c06_u140	(they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
s01_e02_c06_u141	Dr. Oberman.
s01_e02_c06_u142	..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
s01_e02_c06_u143	She.
s01_e02_c06_u144	-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
s01_e02_c06_u145	Yes, and she's very supportive.
s01_e02_c06_u146	Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.
s01_e02_c06_u147	Thanks.
s01_e02_c06_u148	(picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..
s01_e02_c06_u149	Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.)
s01_e02_c07_u150	Barry?
s01_e02_c07_u151	C'mon in.
s01_e02_c07_u152	(hesitates) Are you sure?
s01_e02_c07_u153	Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
s01_e02_c07_u154	Huh?!
s01_e02_c07_u155	So, how ya doin?
s01_e02_c07_u156	I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
s01_e02_c07_u157	Yeah, well..
s01_e02_c07_u158	(answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back in a sec.
s01_e02_c07_u159	I dumped him.
s01_e02_c07_u160	Okay.
s01_e02_c08_u161	So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
s01_e02_c08_u162	Give me a 'for instance'.
s01_e02_c08_u163	Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
s01_e02_c08_u164	Marlon-
s01_e02_c08_u165	Marlon?!
s01_e02_c08_u166	-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
s01_e02_c08_u167	...As in Mouse?
s01_e02_c08_u168	As in my grandmother.
s01_e02_c08_u169	Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
s01_e02_c08_u170	Julia..
s01_e02_c08_u171	We agreed on Minnie.
s01_e02_c08_u172	'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
s01_e02_c09_u173	Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
s01_e02_c09_u174	Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
s01_e02_c09_u175	Oh, that's great.
s01_e02_c09_u176	Why are- why are you so tanned?
s01_e02_c09_u177	Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
s01_e02_c09_u178	Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
s01_e02_c09_u179	No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
s01_e02_c09_u180	Me?!
s01_e02_c09_u181	No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy.
s01_e02_c09_u182	Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
s01_e02_c09_u183	Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
s01_e02_c09_u184	Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs!
s01_e02_c09_u185	Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
s01_e02_c09_u186	And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
s01_e02_c09_u187	Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
s01_e02_c09_u188	Okay..
s01_e02_c09_u189	See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
s01_e02_c09_u190	Wow.
s01_e02_c09_u191	You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
s01_e02_c09_u192	What?
s01_e02_c09_u193	Me. (Spits.)
s01_e02_c09_u194	Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
s01_e02_c09_u195	Well, thank you for giving it back.
s01_e02_c09_u196	Hello?!
s01_e02_c10_u197	Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
s01_e02_c10_u198	Helen Geller? I don't think so.
s01_e02_c10_u199	Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
s01_e02_c10_u200	Thank you!
s01_e02_c10_u201	No, I mean it's not Geller.
s01_e02_c10_u202	What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
s01_e02_c10_u203	No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
s01_e02_c10_u204	Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
s01_e02_c10_u205	It's my baby too.
s01_e02_c10_u206	Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
s01_e02_c10_u207	Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
s01_e02_c10_u208	All right, you two, stop it!
s01_e02_c10_u209	No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
s01_e02_c10_u210	Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
s01_e02_c10_u211	Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
s01_e02_c10_u212	Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
s01_e02_c10_u213	My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
s01_e02_c10_u214	(entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
s01_e02_c10_u215	Yeah. Yeah. A little.
s01_e02_c10_u216	Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back..
s01_e02_c10_u217	You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
s01_e02_c10_u218	Oh my God.
s01_e02_c10_u219	Look at that.
s01_e02_c10_u220	I know.
s01_e02_c11_u221	Well? Isn't that amazing?
s01_e02_c11_u222	What are we supposed to be seeing here?
s01_e02_c11_u223	I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
s01_e02_c11_u224	You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
s01_e02_c11_u225	Then don't do that, alright?
s01_e02_c11_u226	Okay!
s01_e02_c11_u227	(walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?
s01_e02_c11_u228	(welling up) Mm-hmm.
s01_e02_c11_u229	Wh- are you welling up?
s01_e02_c11_u230	No.
s01_e02_c11_u231	You are, you're welling up.
s01_e02_c11_u232	Am not!
s01_e02_c11_u233	You're gonna be an aunt.
s01_e02_c11_u234	(pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!
s01_e02_c11_u235	(on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
s05_e19_c01_u001	Hey!
s05_e19_c01_u002	Hey!
s05_e19_c01_u003	Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
s05_e19_c01_u004	Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
s05_e19_c01_u005	Wow! How'd you get in there?
s05_e19_c01_u006	Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
s05_e19_c01_u007	Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
s05_e19_c01_u008	Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
s05_e19_c01_u009	Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
s05_e19_c01_u010	It's uh, 27 dollars even.
s05_e19_c01_u011	Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go.
s05_e19_c01_u012	Hey, where's the chicken?
s05_e19_c01_u013	Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
s05_e19_c01_u014	(laughs) Great. I'll see you later!
s05_e19_c01_u015	Okay, bye!
s05_e19_c01_u016	What the hell was that?!
s05_e19_c01_u017	What?
s05_e19_c01_u018	The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!
s05_e19_c01_u019	I was not flirting.
s05_e19_c01_u020	It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney, nasally noises.)"
s05_e19_c01_u021	Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
s05_e19_c01_u022	Yeah, right.
s05_e19_c01_u023	You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move towards Ross.)
s05_e19_c01_u024	(backing away) I'm good.
s05_e19_c02_u025	I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
s05_e19_c02_u026	I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
s05_e19_c02_u027	No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
s05_e19_c02_u028	Don't get me started on that.
s05_e19_c02_u029	I was not flirting.
s05_e19_c02_u030	And on your anniversary, for shame!
s05_e19_c02_u031	What's going on?
s05_e19_c02_u032	Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
s05_e19_c02_u033	I was not and oh God, shh!
s05_e19_c02_u034	Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
s05_e19_c02_u035	Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
s05_e19_c02_u036	Well
s05_e19_c02_u037	Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
s05_e19_c02_u038	Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
s05_e19_c02_u039	Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
s05_e19_c02_u040	Hm-mmm.
s05_e19_c02_u041	And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
s05_e19_c02_u042	Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
s05_e19_c02_u043	(looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
s05_e19_c02_u044	This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
s05_e19_c02_u045	See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
s05_e19_c02_u046	(entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
s05_e19_c02_u047	Big night!
s05_e19_c02_u048	This is so cool!
s05_e19_c02_u049	So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
s05_e19_c02_u050	Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
s05_e19_c02_u051	I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.
s05_e19_c02_u052	She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
s05_e19_c02_u053	Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so
s05_e19_c02_u054	(entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!
s05_e19_c02_u055	Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)
s05_e19_c02_u056	So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London
s05_e19_c02_u057	Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)
s05_e19_c02_u058	Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
s05_e19_c02_u059	The one that doesn't.
s05_e19_c02_u060	That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
s05_e19_c02_u061	Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
s05_e19_c02_u062	That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
s05_e19_c02_u063	Okay.
s05_e19_c02_u064	(runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!
s05_e19_c02_u065	But I like it here!
s05_e19_c02_u066	You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
s05_e19_c02_u067	Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
s05_e19_c02_u068	Great!
s05_e19_c02_u069	Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.
s05_e19_c02_u070	Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her room.)
s05_e19_c02_u071	Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
s05_e19_c02_u072	I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we could really tell.)
s05_e19_c02_u073	(She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!
s05_e19_c02_u074	Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
s05_e19_c02_u075	Oh what, you-you want both of them?
s05_e19_c02_u076	Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
s05_e19_c02_u077	Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
s05_e19_c02_u078	Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
s05_e19_c02_u079	Tell her to wear her own earrings.
s05_e19_c02_u080	These are her earrings.
s05_e19_c02_u081	Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
s05_e19_c02_u082	Why not?
s05_e19_c02_u083	Because I lose her stuff!
s05_e19_c02_u084	Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
s05_e19_c02_u085	Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
s05_e19_c02_u086	If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
s05_e19_c02_u087	(noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?
s05_e19_c02_u088	Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
s05_e19_c02_u089	It's a diaper commercial.
s05_e19_c02_u090	Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
s05_e19_c02_u091	Pizza delivery!
s05_e19_c02_u092	I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)
s05_e19_c02_u093	Hi!
s05_e19_c02_u094	Hi!
s05_e19_c02_u095	One uh, vegetarian pizza. That's $12.15.
s05_e19_c02_u096	Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
s05_e19_c02_u097	What?!
s05_e19_c02_u098	(I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
s05_e19_c02_u099	Oh. Thanks.
s05_e19_c02_u100	You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
s05_e19_c02_u101	Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.
s05_e19_c02_u102	Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
s05_e19_c02_u103	I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)
s05_e19_c02_u104	You're welcome.
s05_e19_c02_u105	You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!
s05_e19_c02_u106	What?
s05_e19_c02_u107	This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
s05_e19_c02_u108	What's goin' on?
s05_e19_c02_u109	Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
s05_e19_c02_u110	Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
s05_e19_c02_u111	It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
s05_e19_c02_u112	Really?!
s05_e19_c02_u113	Really?!
s05_e19_c02_u114	It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
s05_e19_c02_u115	(starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
s05_e19_c02_u116	Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
s05_e19_c02_u117	Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
s05_e19_c02_u118	(walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)
s05_e19_c02_u119	Chandler, this actually bothers you?
s05_e19_c02_u120	Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
s05_e19_c02_u121	Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
s05_e19_c02_u122	And thank you, for that.
s05_e19_c02_u123	But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
s05_e19_c02_u124	What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
s05_e19_c02_u125	Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
s05_e19_c02_u126	All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!
s05_e19_c02_u127	(entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!
s05_e19_c02_u128	Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
s05_e19_c02_u129	On your dresser.
s05_e19_c02_u130	Okay that is the one we already have!
s05_e19_c02_u131	Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.
s05_e19_c02_u132	What?
s05_e19_c02_u133	(smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
s05_e19_c02_u134	(smiling) Well, what is it?
s05_e19_c02_u135	(smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.
s05_e19_c02_u136	(smiling) What?!
s05_e19_c02_u137	(smiling) Are you sure?
s05_e19_c02_u138	(smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?
s05_e19_c02_u139	(smiling) Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
s05_e19_c02_u140	(smiling) Yeah.
s05_e19_c02_u141	(smiling) I'm in it.
s05_e19_c03_u142	(smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?
s05_e19_c03_u143	(smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
s05_e19_c03_u144	(not smiling) That's not good.
s05_e19_c03_u145	(smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all smile.)
s05_e19_c03_u146	(smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
s05_e19_c03_u147	(smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
s05_e19_c03_u148	(Something in Italian to Joey.)
s05_e19_c03_u149	Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of course it isn't him.)
s05_e19_c03_u150	(pointing at the screen) No! Sam Waterston!
s05_e19_c03_u151	No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
s05_e19_c03_u152	No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
s05_e19_c03_u153	Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
s05_e19_c03_u154	(following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
s05_e19_c03_u155	But I already gave them back to you!
s05_e19_c03_u156	No you didn't.
s05_e19_c03_u157	All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. (Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?
s05_e19_c03_u158	It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)
s05_e19_c03_u159	Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
s05_e19_c03_u160	Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
s05_e19_c03_u161	Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
s05_e19_c03_u162	(To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
s05_e19_c03_u163	(she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?
s05_e19_c03_u164	Do you like it?
s05_e19_c03_u165	No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"
s05_e19_c03_u166	Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
s05_e19_c03_u167	Ohh! I did not get that.
s05_e19_c03_u168	So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?
s05_e19_c03_u169	Yeah, it's good.
s05_e19_c03_u170	See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
s05_e19_c03_u171	Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
s05_e19_c03_u172	Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
s05_e19_c03_u173	Go on, teach me something about men and women.
s05_e19_c03_u174	Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
s05_e19_c03_u175	No way!
s05_e19_c03_u176	It's true.
s05_e19_c03_u177	Well that's pathetic!
s05_e19_c03_u178	Again true.
s05_e19_c03_u179	And this goes for all guys?
s05_e19_c03_u180	All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
s05_e19_c03_u181	(To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
s05_e19_c03_u182	Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch) ten minutes left!
s05_e19_c03_u183	I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!
s05_e19_c03_u184	No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
s05_e19_c03_u185	(dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)
s05_e19_c03_u186	Joey!
s05_e19_c03_u187	Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.
s05_e19_c03_u188	(entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!
s05_e19_c03_u189	Did you find it?
s05_e19_c03_u190	The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)
s05_e19_c03_u191	Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
s05_e19_c03_u192	Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)
s05_e19_c03_u193	(entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.)
s05_e19_c03_u194	(To Rachel) What are we going to do?!
s05_e19_c03_u195	I don't know, I don't know.
s05_e19_c03_u196	All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
s05_e19_c03_u197	Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.
s05_e19_c03_u198	I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
s05_e19_c03_u199	Ohh that'd be great!
s05_e19_c03_u200	Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
s05_e19_c03_u201	Yeah, what is it?
s05_e19_c03_u202	Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
s05_e19_c03_u203	(shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
s05_e19_c03_u204	I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
s05_e19_c03_u205	All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
s05_e19_c03_u206	No.
s05_e19_c03_u207	Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?
s05_e19_c03_u208	Yeah! You're the best!
s05_e19_c03_u209	Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)
s05_e19_c03_u210	(angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
s05_e19_c03_u211	Your sunglasses?!
s05_e19_c03_u212	Yes!
s05_e19_c03_u213	Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)
s05_e19_c03_u214	(from outside) Pizza!
s05_e19_c03_u215	(running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
s05_e19_c03_u216	Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
s05_e19_c03_u217	Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to- (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)
s05_e19_c03_u218	You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?
s05_e19_c03_u219	Caitlin!
s05_e19_c03_u220	(He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)
s05_e19_c03_u221	It's uh, $12.50.
s05_e19_c03_u222	Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
s05_e19_c03_u223	No actually umm, I think that they're umm, gas.
s05_e19_c03_u224	Gas? Wow! Intense.
s05_e19_c03_u225	(To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
s05_e19_c03_u226	(to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
s05_e19_c03_u227	(wanting more than anything to get the money and leave this horrible, horrible place) Yeah.
s05_e19_c03_u228	They put that in.
s05_e19_c03_u229	What?!
s05_e19_c03_u230	The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
s05_e19_c03_u231	(getting more desperate to leave) Well okay!
s05_e19_c03_u232	A lot of other gas smells
s05_e19_c03_u233	Oh the humanity.
s05_e19_c03_u234	Meth-methane smells
s05_e19_c03_u235	Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go.
s05_e19_c03_u236	Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
s05_e19_c03_u237	Y'know what? That's okay, you guys have ordered so many that this one is on me! (Runs for her life.)
s05_e19_c03_u238	(To All) Was I talking to her about gas?
s05_e19_c03_u239	More so than anything else.
s05_e19_c03_u240	I-I-I found it interesting.
s05_e19_c03_u241	I'm sorry.
s05_e19_c03_u242	Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
s05_e19_c03_u243	Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
s05_e19_c03_u244	(walking over to Ross) Ross?
s05_e19_c03_u245	Yeah?
s05_e19_c03_u246	What else do they add smell too?
s05_e19_c04_u247	Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
s05_e19_c04_u248	Oh, is there a problem?
s05_e19_c04_u249	No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
s05_e19_c04_u250	Oh my God! That was flirting?!
s05_e19_c04_u251	Yeah.
s05_e19_c04_u252	Wow!
s05_e19_c04_u253	I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.
s05_e19_c04_u254	The guy with the gas?!
s05_e19_c04_u255	Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.
s05_e19_c04_u256	Really?!
s05_e19_c04_u257	Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
s05_e19_c04_u258	I just, I thought Joey was there.
s05_e19_c05_u259	(entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
s05_e19_c05_u260	What do you mean?
s05_e19_c05_u261	Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
s05_e19_c05_u262	And she just gave you this?
s05_e19_c05_u263	Yeah!
s05_e19_c05_u264	Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
s05_e19_c05_u265	I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
s05_e19_c05_u266	Well that I can believe.
s05_e19_c05_u267	Yay!
s05_e19_c05_u268	(entering) Hey! Is the show still on?
s05_e19_c05_u269	Almost over man.
s05_e19_c05_u270	(says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)
s05_e19_c05_u271	Why am I looking?
s05_e19_c05_u272	Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!
s05_e19_c05_u273	(on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
s05_e19_c05_u274	Oh Joey!
s05_e19_c05_u275	That's right!
s05_e19_c05_u276	You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
s05_e19_c05_u277	(on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it-(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!
s05_e19_c05_u278	Oh no!
s05_e19_c05_u279	(on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)
s05_e19_c05_u280	(To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!
s05_e19_c05_u281	Joey, bravo! (Starts with that Italian stuff again.)
s05_e19_c05_u282	(singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown-engines-on!
s05_e19_c05_u283	(to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!
s05_e19_c05_u284	I am definitely gonna watch that!
s05_e19_c06_u285	What about these? These look the same?
s05_e19_c06_u286	Definitely!
s05_e19_c06_u287	Not as each other!
s05_e19_c06_u288	Oh, then no.
s05_e19_c06_u289	(To Monica) Hey!
s05_e19_c06_u290	Hi!
s05_e19_c06_u291	You ready?
s05_e19_c06_u292	Yeah.
s05_e19_c06_u293	You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
s05_e19_c06_u294	Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.
s05_e19_c06_u295	Let me see the earrings.
s05_e19_c06_u296	Oh, honey, the earrings
s05_e19_c06_u297	(looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
s05_e19_c06_u298	My boyfriend really does have good taste!
s05_e19_c06_u299	(To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
s05_e19_c06_u300	Hm-mmm.
s07_e07_c01_u001	Morning!
s07_e07_c01_u002	Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
s07_e07_c01_u003	Pretty good.
s07_e07_c01_u004	Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts Joey.)
s07_e07_c01_u005	Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
s07_e07_c01_u006	What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
s07_e07_c01_u007	Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
s07_e07_c01_u008	Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
s07_e07_c01_u009	Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
s07_e07_c01_u010	Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
s07_e07_c01_u011	Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave em for me.
s07_e07_c01_u012	Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
s07_e07_c01_u013	Fine! (Pause) Now, where'd we land on those pancakes? (She chases him out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)
s07_e07_c01_u014	Hi.
s07_e07_c01_u015	Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
s07_e07_c01_u016	Hi.
s07_e07_c01_u017	Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
s07_e07_c01_u018	(pause) Would you like some pancakes?
s07_e07_c02_u019	Come on! Why are we here?!
s07_e07_c02_u020	Okay, okay take a guess.
s07_e07_c02_u021	The hot chicks?
s07_e07_c02_u022	Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)
s07_e07_c02_u023	Wow that's actually pretty cool.
s07_e07_c02_u024	(stopping quickly) Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?
s07_e07_c02_u025	Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
s07_e07_c02_u026	(as they are moving past Ross) I'm so sorry!
s07_e07_c02_u027	Sorry!
s07_e07_c02_u028	You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
s07_e07_c03_u029	She sent the chicken back again?!
s07_e07_c03_u030	She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
s07_e07_c03_u031	Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
s07_e07_c03_u032	(to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planet's most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of course. She's the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.
s07_e07_c03_u033	How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)
s07_e07_c03_u034	I'm fine.
s07_e07_c03_u035	(notices Monica's engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
s07_e07_c03_u036	Oh- Uh
s07_e07_c03_u037	So, who's the lucky guy?
s07_e07_c03_u038	OH-MY-GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
s07_e07_c03_u039	Well, she saw the ring.
s07_e07_c03_u040	Did she freak out?
s07_e07_c03_u041	Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
s07_e07_c03_u042	Right.
s07_e07_c03_u043	Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
s07_e07_c03_u044	(laughs) You said no right?
s07_e07_c03_u045	Huh?
s07_e07_c03_u046	You said no right?!
s07_e07_c03_u047	Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
s07_e07_c03_u048	Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
s07_e07_c03_u049	Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
s07_e07_c03_u050	What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
s07_e07_c03_u051	Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
s07_e07_c03_u052	Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
s07_e07_c03_u053	Really?
s07_e07_c03_u054	No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
s07_e07_c03_u055	So-so you would've just lied?
s07_e07_c03_u056	Yes!!
s07_e07_c03_u057	Would it really have been that easy?
s07_e07_c03_u058	Yes!!!
s07_e07_c03_u059	Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
s07_e07_c04_u060	Hey! What's up?
s07_e07_c04_u061	Hey-hey, who's your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey, startling him) Hey!!
s07_e07_c04_u062	Hey Joey!
s07_e07_c04_u063	Erin! Still here!
s07_e07_c04_u064	Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
s07_e07_c04_u065	Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
s07_e07_c04_u066	Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
s07_e07_c04_u067	I know!
s07_e07_c04_u068	Okay!
s07_e07_c04_u069	Bye Joey. (Kisses him.) Last night was fun.
s07_e07_c04_u070	Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya.
s07_e07_c04_u071	Oh and I'll call ya too!
s07_e07_c04_u072	Or I'll call you!
s07_e07_c04_u073	And call me!
s07_e07_c04_u074	(to Erin) Okay, good to see you again.
s07_e07_c04_u075	Bye.
s07_e07_c04_u076	Bye-bye.
s07_e07_c04_u077	Bye!
s07_e07_c04_u078	So, system kinda broke down huh?!
s07_e07_c04_u079	Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I
s07_e07_c04_u080	We want you to marry her!
s07_e07_c04_u081	What?!!
s07_e07_c04_u082	She is so amazing! You have no idea.
s07_e07_c04_u083	No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
s07_e07_c04_u084	Cupid.
s07_e07_c04_u085	Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
s07_e07_c04_u086	Man, do you know what guys want!
s07_e07_c04_u087	Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
s07_e07_c04_u088	My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
s07_e07_c04_u089	Yeah, but you always say that.
s07_e07_c04_u090	Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
s07_e07_c04_u091	Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
s07_e07_c04_u092	Whatever.
s07_e07_c04_u093	Fine. (They start to walk away.)
s07_e07_c04_u094	Hey, don't start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
s07_e07_c04_u095	Phoebe!
s07_e07_c04_u096	Secret affair!
s07_e07_c05_u097	People are doing it in front of my book!
s07_e07_c05_u098	I'm sorry?
s07_e07_c05_u099	My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
s07_e07_c05_u100	Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
s07_e07_c05_u101	Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
s07_e07_c05_u102	Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
s07_e07_c05_u103	Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
s07_e07_c05_u104	Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
s07_e07_c05_u105	Oh for cryin' out loud! (He storms out.)
s07_e07_c05_u106	All right, so we should go catch our movie.
s07_e07_c05_u107	Well now what's the rush?
s07_e07_c05_u108	I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.
s07_e07_c05_u109	(entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!
s07_e07_c05_u110	Well look who's here!
s07_e07_c05_u111	Hey!
s07_e07_c05_u112	Hey!
s07_e07_c05_u113	Joey.
s07_e07_c05_u114	Erin.
s07_e07_c05_u115	Hey Rachel.
s07_e07_c05_u116	Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
s07_e07_c05_u117	What's wrong?
s07_e07_c05_u118	Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
s07_e07_c05_u119	Oh no.
s07_e07_c05_u120	(skeptical) What party?
s07_e07_c05_u121	Who's birthday party?
s07_e07_c05_u122	(still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?
s07_e07_c05_u123	(does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
s07_e07_c05_u124	(still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.
s07_e07_c06_u125	Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
s07_e07_c06_u126	Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
s07_e07_c06_u127	No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian brings his boss over.)
s07_e07_c06_u128	How can I help you?
s07_e07_c06_u129	Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
s07_e07_c06_u130	We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
s07_e07_c06_u131	Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don't you follow me!
s07_e07_c07_u132	Hey.
s07_e07_c07_u133	Hey!
s07_e07_c07_u134	How did it go with Erin?
s07_e07_c07_u135	Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
s07_e07_c07_u136	Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
s07_e07_c07_u137	No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
s07_e07_c07_u138	Didn't you sleep together?
s07_e07_c07_u139	Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a
s07_e07_c07_u140	(gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don't get married before I do.
s07_e07_c07_u141	Okay.
s07_e07_c08_u142	Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
s07_e07_c08_u143	He might still show up.
s07_e07_c08_u144	Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
s07_e07_c08_u145	Is that all?
s07_e07_c08_u146	I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
s07_e07_c08_u147	Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
s07_e07_c08_u148	It's actually going to be just family.
s07_e07_c08_u149	Oh-wait-you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
s07_e07_c09_u150	How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
s07_e07_c09_u151	What about Benitez?
s07_e07_c09_u152	What about Game 1 of the Series?
s07_e07_c09_u153	What about shut up?
s07_e07_c09_u154	You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin) I'll be right back.
s07_e07_c09_u155	Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)
s07_e07_c09_u156	So how's it goin' with Joey?
s07_e07_c09_u157	Uh, okay.
s07_e07_c09_u158	Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
s07_e07_c09_u159	Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
s07_e07_c09_u160	But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
s07_e07_c09_u161	Kinda.
s07_e07_c09_u162	Then change it back!
s07_e07_c09_u163	I'm sorry I- It's just there's no real spark.
s07_e07_c09_u164	No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
s07_e07_c09_u165	Yeah.
s07_e07_c09_u166	Ugh, tramp!
s07_e07_c09_u167	Does Joey have any idea?
s07_e07_c09_u168	I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
s07_e07_c09_u169	Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
s07_e07_c09_u170	Yeah! That would be great!
s07_e07_c09_u171	Yeah, and maybe that you're a real (She says something in Italian, and it doesn't matter what she said. It's not important so I don't need everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)
s07_e07_c09_u172	I'm sorry?
s07_e07_c09_u173	Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
s07_e07_c09_u174	(returning) Hey! You wanna go?
s07_e07_c09_u175	Yeah, let's go.
s07_e07_c09_u176	Okay. See you guys later.
s07_e07_c09_u177	Bye guys.
s07_e07_c09_u178	Yeah, see ya.
s07_e07_c09_u179	(whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)
s07_e07_c09_u180	Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
s07_e07_c09_u181	No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
s07_e07_c10_u182	Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
s07_e07_c10_u183	Yeah, we were-we were just looking around.
s07_e07_c10_u184	Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
s07_e07_c10_u185	Uhh-.
s07_e07_c10_u186	Ah- Ah-Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
s07_e07_c10_u187	Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
s07_e07_c10_u188	I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
s07_e07_c10_u189	I'm sorry, who are you?
s07_e07_c10_u190	I'm a professor here uh, Ross-Geller.
s07_e07_c10_u191	Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! (Grabs his book off of the shelf.) Did you write this?
s07_e07_c10_u192	Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
s07_e07_c10_u193	Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're-you're so young.
s07_e07_c10_u194	Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
s07_e07_c10_u195	I am very-very sorry.
s07_e07_c11_u196	Hey!
s07_e07_c11_u197	Hey!
s07_e07_c11_u198	Hi!
s07_e07_c11_u199	So how was, how was your date?
s07_e07_c11_u200	Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still- And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
s07_e07_c11_u201	Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
s07_e07_c11_u202	No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
s07_e07_c11_u203	Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
s07_e07_c11_u204	Where are you gettin' this?
s07_e07_c11_u205	Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
s07_e07_c11_u206	Oh. Oh.
s07_e07_c11_u207	Joey
s07_e07_c11_u208	No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! (Heads for his room.) Right?
s07_e07_c11_u209	Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
s07_e07_c11_u210	Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell em you're not looking for a relationship.
s07_e07_c11_u211	No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
s07_e07_c11_u212	Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?
s07_e07_c11_u213	Yeah?
s07_e07_c11_u214	Do you want some pancakes?
s07_e07_c11_u215	(coming back out) Finally!
s07_e07_c12_u216	What are we gonna do?
s07_e07_c12_u217	I say we go with Careless Whisper.
s07_e07_c12_u218	Chandler?
s07_e07_c12_u219	(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
s07_e07_c12_u220	Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
s07_e07_c12_u221	Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
s07_e07_c12_u222	(To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
s07_e07_c12_u223	Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
s07_e07_c12_u224	Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
s07_e07_c12_u225	(starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?
s07_e07_c12_u226	Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
s07_e07_c12_u227	Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)
s07_e07_c12_u228	We'll just-we'll just let her stay.
s07_e07_c12_u229	No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
s07_e07_c12_u230	Kinda like your Barca lounger.
s07_e07_c12_u231	Is that what you're thinking about right now?
s07_e07_c12_u232	I never stop thinking about it.
s07_e07_c12_u233	Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
s07_e07_c12_u234	Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
s07_e07_c12_u235	Why not?
s07_e07_c12_u236	Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
s07_e07_c12_u237	Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you have a cat? Cause it's already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)
s07_e07_c12_u238	Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
s07_e07_c12_u239	Why?
s07_e07_c12_u240	Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
s07_e07_c12_u241	He does?
s07_e07_c12_u242	Say again?
s07_e07_c12_u243	That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
s07_e07_c12_u244	Feelings, such strong feelings.
s07_e07_c12_u245	I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
s07_e07_c12_u246	Oh-my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. (Starts for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)
s07_e07_c13_u247	(to the guard) Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in people's eye-(The guard walks away)-Okay, see you later.
s07_e07_c13_u248	I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
s07_e10_c01_u001	Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
s07_e10_c01_u002	Betrothed- (Corrects him)
s07_e10_c01_u003	betrothed couple.
s07_e10_c01_u004	(entering carrying a skull) Hey!
s07_e10_c01_u005	Hey!
s07_e10_c01_u006	Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
s07_e10_c01_u007	Pheebs?
s07_e10_c01_u008	Huh?
s07_e10_c01_u009	Skull?
s07_e10_c01_u010	Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
s07_e10_c01_u011	(freaking out) Oh my god!!
s07_e10_c01_u012	No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of licorice, and takes a bite.)
s07_e10_c01_u013	(entering) Hey!
s07_e10_c01_u014	Hey!
s07_e10_c01_u015	(Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?
s07_e10_c01_u016	(Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
s07_e10_c01_u017	Ohh! That's great!
s07_e10_c01_u018	Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
s07_e10_c01_u019	Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
s07_e10_c01_u020	And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
s07_e10_c01_u021	You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
s07_e10_c01_u022	Hmm.
s07_e10_c01_u023	Hey. (He exits)
s07_e10_c01_u024	(to Monica) Did you know he was in there?
s07_e10_c01_u025	No.
s07_e10_c01_u026	How long have we been home?
s07_e10_c01_u027	About a half an hour.
s07_e10_c01_u028	Lovely!
s07_e10_c02_u029	Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
s07_e10_c02_u030	No.
s07_e10_c02_u031	Why not?
s07_e10_c02_u032	Bing's weird.
s07_e10_c02_u033	(entering) Oh, hey, you guys!
s07_e10_c02_u034	Hey!
s07_e10_c02_u035	Hey!
s07_e10_c02_u036	Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
s07_e10_c02_u037	Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
s07_e10_c02_u038	Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
s07_e10_c02_u039	Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
s07_e10_c02_u040	Yeah, why not?
s07_e10_c02_u041	Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
s07_e10_c02_u042	Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
s07_e10_c02_u043	No reason, except-she-told-me.
s07_e10_c02_u044	Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?
s07_e10_c02_u045	No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
s07_e10_c02_u046	Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
s07_e10_c02_u047	You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
s07_e10_c02_u048	Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
s07_e10_c02_u049	Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look surprised) Kind of what probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)
s07_e10_c02_u050	Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
s07_e10_c03_u051	(entering) Hey!
s07_e10_c03_u052	Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas! (Starts drumming.)
s07_e10_c03_u053	Drums?
s07_e10_c03_u054	(yelling) No! Drums!
s07_e10_c04_u055	(to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (Laughs.)
s07_e10_c04_u056	I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
s07_e10_c04_u057	Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
s07_e10_c04_u058	Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
s07_e10_c04_u059	I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
s07_e10_c04_u060	Is this because of the burrito thing?
s07_e10_c04_u061	(pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.
s07_e10_c04_u062	Give him money? It was a joke!
s07_e10_c04_u063	No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
s07_e10_c04_u064	Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
s07_e10_c04_u065	You've got to be smooth about it.
s07_e10_c04_u066	Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly) Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)
s07_e10_c04_u067	Of course, sir.
s07_e10_c04_u068	Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
s07_e10_c04_u069	How did it go?
s07_e10_c04_u070	Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the money in it)
s07_e10_c05_u071	Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?
s07_e10_c05_u072	No.
s07_e10_c05_u073	Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?
s07_e10_c05_u074	Christmas.
s07_e10_c05_u075	Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
s07_e10_c05_u076	Christmas eve.
s07_e10_c05_u077	Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesn't.) Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
s07_e10_c05_u078	Santa has reindeers that can fly!
s07_e10_c05_u079	Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
s07_e10_c05_u080	(singing) Jingle bells, jingle bells...
s07_e10_c05_u081	(interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh (Sings) Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
s07_e10_c05_u082	(singing) Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
s07_e10_c05_u083	(interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest.
s07_e10_c05_u084	When is Santa coming?
s07_e10_c05_u085	Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
s07_e10_c05_u086	No Santa? Was I bad?
s07_e10_c05_u087	No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.
s07_e10_c05_u088	Santa's mad at me.
s07_e10_c05_u089	No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!
s07_e10_c05_u090	So Santa's coming?
s07_e10_c05_u091	(disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!
s07_e10_c06_u092	It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
s07_e10_c06_u093	How do you know so much about this?
s07_e10_c06_u094	I don't know.
s07_e10_c06_u095	Richard used to do it, didn't he?
s07_e10_c06_u096	We'd be eating our soup right now.
s07_e10_c06_u097	Mustached bastard
s07_e10_c06_u098	(sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
s07_e10_c06_u099	(walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
s07_e10_c06_u100	(finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore)
s07_e10_c07_u101	(stopping at Phoebe's entrance) Ha!
s07_e10_c07_u102	So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
s07_e10_c07_u103	Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel) Ready? One, two, three, four...
s07_e10_c07_u104	That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)
s07_e10_c08_u105	Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.
s07_e10_c08_u106	Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey Pheebs!
s07_e10_c08_u107	Hey!
s07_e10_c08_u108	Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.
s07_e10_c08_u109	Hey Pheebs!
s07_e10_c08_u110	Hey! (she sits down next to him)
s07_e10_c08_u111	If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
s07_e10_c08_u112	It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
s07_e10_c08_u113	Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
s07_e10_c08_u114	Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
s07_e10_c08_u115	Maybe on some level.
s07_e10_c09_u116	Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
s07_e10_c09_u117	What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
s07_e10_c09_u118	(entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you another present. (She puts it on the counter)
s07_e10_c09_u119	Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what is it?
s07_e10_c09_u120	It's a-tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
s07_e10_c09_u121	What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?
s07_e10_c09_u122	Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into his room)
s07_e10_c09_u123	Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
s07_e10_c09_u124	(sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)
s07_e10_c09_u125	What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?
s07_e10_c09_u126	Our apartment is ready.
s07_e10_c09_u127	And that makes you angry because
s07_e10_c09_u128	Because you would rather live here with Joey.
s07_e10_c09_u129	Where did you get that?
s07_e10_c09_u130	Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
s07_e10_c09_u131	Phoebe?
s07_e10_c09_u132	Hm?
s07_e10_c09_u133	Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
s07_e10_c09_u134	(nods along) Fish!
s07_e10_c09_u135	It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.
s07_e10_c09_u136	Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here
s07_e10_c09_u137	Oh, it's so much more fun with you.
s07_e10_c09_u138	We did have fun, didn't we?
s07_e10_c09_u139	We did!
s07_e10_c09_u140	Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
s07_e10_c09_u141	Oh, I would love to!
s07_e10_c09_u142	Yay, okay!
s07_e10_c09_u143	Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the sticks)
s07_e10_c09_u144	Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
s07_e10_c09_u145	(with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it) Done!
s07_e10_c10_u146	Hey!
s07_e10_c10_u147	Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
s07_e10_c10_u148	No, these are my pants.
s07_e10_c10_u149	Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
s07_e10_c10_u150	Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?
s07_e10_c10_u151	Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
s07_e10_c10_u152	Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I-uh, you gotta have something.
s07_e10_c11_u153	I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!
s07_e10_c11_u154	What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
s07_e10_c11_u155	(to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
s07_e10_c11_u156	Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from-Texas.
s07_e10_c11_u157	Texas?
s07_e10_c11_u158	That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to bend down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
s07_e10_c11_u159	Wow! Thanks!
s07_e10_c11_u160	You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
s07_e10_c11_u161	Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.
s07_e10_c11_u162	(gasps) You are? Me, too!
s07_e10_c11_u163	Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
s07_e10_c11_u164	(to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
s07_e10_c11_u165	Cool!
s07_e10_c11_u166	Yeah!
s07_e10_c11_u167	Come on Ben.
s07_e10_c11_u168	Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
s07_e10_c11_u169	(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
s07_e10_c11_u170	Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)
s07_e10_c11_u171	Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
s07_e10_c11_u172	What are you doing here, Santa?
s07_e10_c11_u173	Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird-turtle-man?
s07_e10_c11_u174	I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
s07_e10_c11_u175	What?
s07_e10_c11_u176	Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
s07_e10_c11_u177	You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!
s07_e10_c11_u178	Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
s07_e10_c11_u179	(to Chandler) What are you doing?
s07_e10_c11_u180	You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
s07_e10_c11_u181	Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.
s07_e10_c11_u182	Why?
s07_e10_c11_u183	Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
s07_e10_c11_u184	But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
s07_e10_c11_u185	I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.
s07_e10_c11_u186	Fine, I'll give the suit back.
s07_e10_c11_u187	(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
s07_e10_c11_u188	Santa? Really?
s07_e10_c11_u189	Yes, is that okay?
s07_e10_c11_u190	Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
s07_e10_c11_u191	No.
s07_e10_c11_u192	Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
s07_e10_c11_u193	Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
s07_e10_c11_u194	No! Why does he have to go?
s07_e10_c11_u195	Because, if Santa and the Holiday-Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
s07_e10_c11_u196	No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
s07_e10_c11_u197	Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
s07_e10_c11_u198	Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
s07_e10_c11_u199	Okay, Santa!
s07_e10_c11_u200	All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
s07_e10_c11_u201	(entering wearing a Superman costume) Merry Christmas!
s07_e10_c12_u202	Oh wow! Look at this place!
s07_e10_c12_u203	Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!
s07_e10_c12_u204	(yelling from another room) Oh my God!
s07_e10_c12_u205	What?
s07_e10_c12_u206	(returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
s07_e10_c12_u207	Yeah?
s07_e10_c12_u208	And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
s07_e10_c12_u209	Yeah?
s07_e10_c12_u210	Do you really not know where I'm going with this? (Phoebe nods, "No.") It left! It's one huge room!
s07_e10_c12_u211	Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!
s07_e10_c12_u212	See?
s07_e10_c12_u213	Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.
s07_e10_c12_u214	You can't, because of the new skylight!
s07_e10_c12_u215	There's a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.) Wow!!
s07_e10_c12_u216	So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
s07_e10_c12_u217	(returning slowly) Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
s07_e10_c12_u218	Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
s07_e10_c12_u219	A little bit, yeah.
s07_e10_c12_u220	Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
s07_e10_c12_u221	You heard her too?! You have the gift!
s07_e10_c12_u222	Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey.
s07_e10_c12_u223	Are you sure?
s07_e10_c12_u224	Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
s07_e10_c12_u225	Oh me too.
s07_e10_c12_u226	I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
s07_e10_c12_u227	No, I do not hear that.
s07_e10_c13_u228	and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for
s07_e10_c13_u229	(answering him) Eight whole days.
s07_e10_c13_u230	That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
s07_e10_c13_u231	Awesome!
s07_e10_c13_u232	Yeah?
s07_e10_c13_u233	My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who's nodding.)
s07_e10_c13_u234	The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben, and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
s07_e10_c13_u235	(entering with Phoebe) Hey!
s07_e10_c13_u236	Oh.
s07_e10_c13_u237	(seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
s07_e10_c13_u238	Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!
s07_e10_c13_u239	Oh.
s07_e10_c13_u240	Oh.
s07_e10_c13_u241	Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
s07_e10_c14_u242	I got it!
s07_e10_c14_u243	(yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?
s07_e10_c14_u244	Its back in cage!
s07_e10_c14_u245	Cage closed?
s07_e10_c14_u246	Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
s05_e22_c01_u001	What's going on?
s05_e22_c01_u002	Well, my eye is a little itchy.
s05_e22_c01_u003	Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.
s05_e22_c01_u004	(To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
s05_e22_c01_u005	Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
s05_e22_c01_u006	Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
s05_e22_c01_u007	Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!
s05_e22_c01_u008	Okay, so Richard, Richard!
s05_e22_c01_u009	It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
s05_e22_c01_u010	Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
s05_e22_c01_u011	Oh God, here we go!
s05_e22_c01_u012	What?
s05_e22_c01_u013	Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)
s05_e22_c01_u014	(flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
s05_e22_c01_u015	All right, fine.
s05_e22_c01_u016	Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And on the "I" part she mimics poking her eye.)
s05_e22_c01_u017	(flinches again) Monica! Come on!
s05_e22_c01_u018	Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes his eye)
s05_e22_c01_u019	(freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!
s05_e22_c01_u020	How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the point by now.)
s05_e22_c01_u021	Chandler!
s05_e22_c01_u022	Me too! Me too! Me too! (Yeah, he does the same thing.)
s05_e22_c01_u023	Just stop it! Come on!
s05_e22_c01_u024	You okay there man?
s05_e22_c01_u025	Yeah, I got too excited!
s05_e22_c02_u026	All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
s05_e22_c02_u027	Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
s05_e22_c02_u028	All right, bye!
s05_e22_c02_u029	Bye!
s05_e22_c02_u030	Bye!
s05_e22_c02_u031	Later! (Exits.)
s05_e22_c02_u032	(after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
s05_e22_c02_u033	Wow umm, calm down.
s05_e22_c02_u034	I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
s05_e22_c02_u035	Why are so mad at him?
s05_e22_c02_u036	Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
s05_e22_c02_u037	Well, it just seems that
s05_e22_c02_u038	You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
s05_e22_c02_u039	Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
s05_e22_c02_u040	Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, "Ross" on it.
s05_e22_c02_u041	(entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
s05_e22_c02_u042	You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
s05_e22_c02_u043	It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears- But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."
s05_e22_c02_u044	Ohh-oh, chilling!
s05_e22_c02_u045	And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!
s05_e22_c02_u046	Yeah, I know that means buddy!
s05_e22_c02_u047	Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
s05_e22_c02_u048	Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
s05_e22_c02_u049	Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
s05_e22_c02_u050	No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
s05_e22_c02_u051	All right! Thanks Pheebs!
s05_e22_c02_u052	Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
s05_e22_c02_u053	Oh umm, not go.
s05_e22_c02_u054	All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?
s05_e22_c02_u055	Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.
s05_e22_c02_u056	Thank you.
s05_e22_c02_u057	Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!
s05_e22_c02_u058	(entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! (She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!
s05_e22_c02_u059	No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)
s05_e22_c03_u060	Oh hey Joey! What's up?
s05_e22_c03_u061	I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
s05_e22_c03_u062	Yeah, I've been around.
s05_e22_c03_u063	Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
s05_e22_c03_u064	Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
s05_e22_c03_u065	Great! Problem solved!
s05_e22_c03_u066	But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
s05_e22_c03_u067	Well, back to square one.
s05_e22_c03_u068	Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
s05_e22_c03_u069	(quickly) Yes!
s05_e22_c03_u070	Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
s05_e22_c03_u071	Peanut butter!
s05_e22_c03_u072	Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
s05_e22_c03_u073	A swimmer!
s05_e22_c03_u074	Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
s05_e22_c03_u075	Monica. Oh- huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
s05_e22_c03_u076	No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
s05_e22_c03_u077	Ascot!
s05_e22_c03_u078	North route or south route?
s05_e22_c03_u079	North route!
s05_e22_c03_u080	Bamn! There you go! Huh?
s05_e22_c03_u081	Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
s05_e22_c03_u082	(entering) Hey!
s05_e22_c03_u083	Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)
s05_e22_c03_u084	Hey man, what's up?
s05_e22_c03_u085	Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
s05_e22_c03_u086	Sure, what do you want to see?
s05_e22_c03_u087	I don't know, umm
s05_e22_c03_u088	Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
s05_e22_c03_u089	Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a table previously.)
s05_e22_c03_u090	What's with her?
s05_e22_c03_u091	I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
s05_e22_c03_u092	Okay.
s05_e22_c03_u093	What do you like better action or comedy?
s05_e22_c03_u094	Action.
s05_e22_c03_u095	Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
s05_e22_c03_u096	Dude, you are sick.
s05_e22_c03_u097	Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
s05_e22_c04_u098	Oh my God! What does that thing do?
s05_e22_c04_u099	(looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.
s05_e22_c04_u100	All right, I'm outta here!
s05_e22_c04_u101	I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
s05_e22_c04_u102	Hey!
s05_e22_c04_u103	So were done then!
s05_e22_c04_u104	Almost! But first, we gotta start.
s05_e22_c04_u105	Okay.
s05_e22_c04_u106	This is a glaucoma test.
s05_e22_c04_u107	Uh-huh.
s05_e22_c04_u108	Sit down.
s05_e22_c04_u109	Okay.
s05_e22_c04_u110	But your chin here. (She does so.) Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
s05_e22_c04_u111	(jerks back from the tester) What?!
s05_e22_c04_u112	A small puff of air, now come on!
s05_e22_c04_u113	Here we go.
s05_e22_c04_u114	All right.
s05_e22_c04_u115	1-2-3! (Rachel jerks back on 3.)
s05_e22_c04_u116	I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head back.) Okay.
s05_e22_c04_u117	Ready?
s05_e22_c04_u118	Uh-huh.
s05_e22_c04_u119	1-2- (She flinches on 2 this time.)
s05_e22_c04_u120	Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
s05_e22_c04_u121	Okay.
s05_e22_c04_u122	That's okay.
s05_e22_c04_u123	Okay. (Monica backs off.)
s05_e22_c04_u124	Okay. Okay!
s05_e22_c04_u125	1-2! (She flinches again.) (Gives up.) Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
s05_e22_c04_u126	(really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)
s05_e22_c04_u127	Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
s05_e22_c04_u128	Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
s05_e22_c04_u129	Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
s05_e22_c04_u130	Great!
s05_e22_c04_u131	And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
s05_e22_c04_u132	Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)
s05_e22_c04_u133	Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F D.
s05_e22_c04_u134	Very good Monica! You know where they are.
s05_e22_c04_u135	I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.) (To Rachel) And you don't get one!
s05_e22_c05_u136	Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
s05_e22_c05_u137	They're still in my coat.
s05_e22_c05_u138	Damn!
s05_e22_c05_u139	(entering) Hey!
s05_e22_c05_u140	Hey! You ready to go?
s05_e22_c05_u141	Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
s05_e22_c05_u142	What?
s05_e22_c05_u143	I love you.
s05_e22_c05_u144	Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
s05_e22_c05_u145	Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
s05_e22_c05_u146	Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
s05_e22_c05_u147	Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
s05_e22_c05_u148	I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
s05_e22_c05_u149	Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
s05_e22_c05_u150	So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
s05_e22_c05_u151	Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
s05_e22_c05_u152	(entering) Hey!
s05_e22_c05_u153	Hey!
s05_e22_c05_u154	I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
s05_e22_c05_u155	You got it!
s05_e22_c05_u156	All right!
s05_e22_c05_u157	All right, bye-bye now!
s05_e22_c05_u158	Bye!
s05_e22_c05_u159	Bye you guys!
s05_e22_c05_u160	Bye-bye!
s05_e22_c05_u161	I wanna say good-bye at the car!
s05_e22_c05_u162	Okay!
s05_e22_c05_u163	Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
s05_e22_c05_u164	Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
s05_e22_c05_u165	See ya! (Walks out.)
s05_e22_c05_u166	Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs after him.)
s05_e22_c05_u167	Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away) Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He grabs the magazine away from her.)
s05_e22_c05_u168	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
s05_e22_c05_u169	Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
s05_e22_c05_u170	Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
s05_e22_c05_u171	Well, I don't know.
s05_e22_c05_u172	Well, I can't help you.
s05_e22_c05_u173	Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?
s05_e22_c05_u174	Apology accepted.
s05_e22_c05_u175	Okay. So we're, we're good?
s05_e22_c05_u176	Uh-huh.
s05_e22_c05_u177	All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?
s05_e22_c05_u178	(quietly) Bye, fat ass.
s05_e22_c05_u179	ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
s05_e22_c05_u180	I don't know! I don't remember!
s05_e22_c05_u181	Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
s05_e22_c05_u182	Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
s05_e22_c06_u183	Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
s05_e22_c06_u184	We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
s05_e22_c06_u185	Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.
s05_e22_c06_u186	Yeah.
s05_e22_c06_u187	You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!
s05_e22_c06_u188	Isn't that Ross's money?
s05_e22_c06_u189	Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
s05_e22_c06_u190	I don't know.
s05_e22_c06_u191	Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
s05_e22_c06_u192	Okay!
s05_e22_c06_u193	Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
s05_e22_c06_u194	Too dry.
s05_e22_c06_u195	Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
s05_e22_c06_u196	No!
s05_e22_c06_u197	Is this movie gonna be my big break?
s05_e22_c06_u198	No!
s05_e22_c06_u199	(shocked) What?!
s05_e22_c06_u200	Yes.
s05_e22_c06_u201	Dude you said, "No!"
s05_e22_c06_u202	I also said, "Yes!"
s05_e22_c06_u203	You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
s05_e22_c06_u204	No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!
s05_e22_c06_u205	I don't believe this!
s05_e22_c06_u206	Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
s05_e22_c06_u207	What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
s05_e22_c06_u208	They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
s05_e22_c06_u209	Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
s05_e22_c06_u210	Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
s05_e22_c06_u211	Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
s05_e22_c06_u212	Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
s05_e22_c06_u213	Not if you're gonna be like this!
s05_e22_c06_u214	All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
s05_e22_c06_u215	Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
s05_e22_c06_u216	All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
s05_e22_c06_u217	Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.) Get out!
s05_e22_c06_u218	You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
s05_e22_c06_u219	Get out!!
s05_e22_c06_u220	All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
s05_e22_c07_u221	Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
s05_e22_c07_u222	No.
s05_e22_c07_u223	Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
s05_e22_c07_u224	No that made me feel precious.
s05_e22_c07_u225	Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
s05_e22_c07_u226	Yeah? Sometimes it's- (Does the fist thing.)
s05_e22_c07_u227	Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
s05_e22_c07_u228	Okay, I'm the baby. (Points at his eye.)
s05_e22_c07_u229	Eh! Stop it!
s05_e22_c07_u230	(entering) Hey!
s05_e22_c07_u231	Chandler! What are you doing here?
s05_e22_c07_u232	Hey!
s05_e22_c07_u233	Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
s05_e22_c07_u234	Why?!
s05_e22_c07_u235	I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
s05_e22_c07_u236	That game should not be played without my supervision.
s05_e22_c07_u237	Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
s05_e22_c07_u238	What's in the bag?
s05_e22_c07_u239	Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
s05_e22_c07_u240	I do!
s05_e22_c08_u241	Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only problem is, it's not over her eye.)
s05_e22_c08_u242	Not even close.
s05_e22_c08_u243	Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
s05_e22_c08_u244	Okay! All right! Let's do it!
s05_e22_c08_u245	All right!
s05_e22_c08_u246	Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)
s05_e22_c08_u247	All right.
s05_e22_c08_u248	Put your head back.
s05_e22_c08_u249	Yes!
s05_e22_c08_u250	All right.
s05_e22_c08_u251	Okay.
s05_e22_c08_u252	Now, open your eyes.
s05_e22_c08_u253	Okay, they are. (No they're not.)
s05_e22_c08_u254	How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)
s05_e22_c08_u255	(thinks) Four.
s05_e22_c08_u256	Oh my God, I was thinking four.
s05_e22_c08_u257	Really?!
s05_e22_c08_u258	Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
s05_e22_c08_u259	Okay!
s05_e22_c08_u260	No drops!
s05_e22_c08_u261	Great!
s05_e22_c08_u262	Okay.
s05_e22_c08_u263	Okay.
s05_e22_c08_u264	On three, 1-2-3! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the eyedropper.)
s05_e22_c08_u265	Well, well, you said it was practice!
s05_e22_c08_u266	Then why did you move?!
s05_e22_c08_u267	Because I knew you were lying!
s05_e22_c08_u268	All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by her legs.)
s05_e22_c08_u269	(as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
s05_e22_c08_u270	I am going- I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm- I am going to get these drops in your eyes. (She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.)
s05_e22_c08_u271	Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
s05_e22_c08_u272	Monica! Stop it!
s05_e22_c08_u273	(spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!
s05_e22_c08_u274	Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risque pose, at least for primetime TV.)
s05_e22_c09_u275	Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!
s05_e22_c09_u276	(answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
s05_e22_c09_u277	(on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
s05_e22_c09_u278	What did you do to his sweater vests?
s05_e22_c09_u279	Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
s05_e22_c09_u280	Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)
s05_e22_c09_u281	Hey, dude!
s05_e22_c09_u282	Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
s05_e22_c09_u283	Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)
s05_e22_c09_u284	(who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
s05_e22_c09_u285	Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering- (We hear the dial tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
s05_e22_c09_u286	Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
s05_e22_c09_u287	Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
s05_e22_c09_u288	That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn
s05_e22_c09_u289	No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
s05_e22_c09_u290	Really?
s05_e22_c09_u291	Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
s05_e22_c09_u292	(entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
s05_e22_c09_u293	Uh-hmm.
s05_e22_c09_u294	What do you like better flora or fauna?
s05_e22_c09_u295	Fauna.
s05_e22_c09_u296	Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
s05_e22_c09_u297	Garfunkle.
s05_e22_c09_u298	Why are you mad at me?
s05_e22_c09_u299	You said I was boring--Ohh!
s05_e22_c09_u300	When did I say you were boring?!
s05_e22_c09_u301	Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
s05_e22_c09_u302	Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
s05_e22_c09_u303	Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
s05_e22_c10_u304	Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
s05_e22_c10_u305	Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
s05_e22_c10_u306	Wh-what?! Why?!
s05_e22_c10_u307	It's a money thing, we don't have any.
s05_e22_c10_u308	(laughs) You're kidding right?
s05_e22_c10_u309	No.
s05_e22_c10_u310	What?!
s05_e22_c10_u311	It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
s05_e22_c10_u312	Uh, hang out?! How long?
s05_e22_c10_u313	I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
s05_e22_c10_u314	No!
s05_e22_c10_u315	Eh, worth a shot. (Gets into his car.) Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay? (The car peels away.)
s05_e22_c10_u316	Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
s05_e22_c10_u317	Yeah.
s05_e22_c10_u318	These got left for ya. (He hands him a bunch of helium balloons.)
s05_e22_c10_u319	Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your big break.
s05_e22_c11_u320	(answering it) Hello?
s05_e22_c11_u321	(on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!
s05_e22_c11_u322	Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!
s05_e22_c11_u323	Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
s05_e22_c11_u324	Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
s05_e22_c11_u325	Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
s05_e22_c11_u326	(to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
s05_e22_c11_u327	Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me now.
s05_e22_c12_u328	Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
s05_e22_c12_u329	Yep!
s05_e22_c12_u330	Go!!
s05_e22_c12_u331	What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
s05_e22_c12_u332	Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone climbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
s05_e22_c12_u333	Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.)
s01_e24_c01_u001	And here's little Ben nodding off...
s01_e24_c01_u002	Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
s01_e24_c01_u003	Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
s01_e24_c01_u004	Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
s01_e24_c01_u005	(quietly) That would be nice.
s01_e24_c01_u006	Pardon?
s01_e24_c01_u007	Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)
s01_e24_c01_u008	Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
s01_e24_c01_u009	Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
s01_e24_c01_u010	I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
s01_e24_c01_u011	(sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
s01_e24_c01_u012	Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
s01_e24_c01_u013	(overhearing) What kind of research?
s01_e24_c01_u014	Oh, just, y'know.... science.
s01_e24_c01_u015	Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued, they all look over)
s01_e24_c01_u016	(sigh)... It's a fertility study.
s01_e24_c01_u017	Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
s01_e24_c01_u018	Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
s01_e24_c01_u019	Hey.
s01_e24_c01_u020	Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
s01_e24_c02_u021	OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
s01_e24_c02_u022	We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... (hands meat to Monica)
s01_e24_c02_u023	(in a deep voice) Men are here.
s01_e24_c02_u024	We make fire. Cook meat.
s01_e24_c02_u025	Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
s01_e24_c02_u026	Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
s01_e24_c02_u027	Oh, OK.
s01_e24_c02_u028	So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your (provocatively) special someone?
s01_e24_c02_u029	I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
s01_e24_c02_u030	Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
s01_e24_c02_u031	What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
s01_e24_c02_u032	Man's got a point.
s01_e24_c02_u033	Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
s01_e24_c02_u034	Crazy bitch.
s01_e24_c02_u035	Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
s01_e24_c02_u036	Joey... we always know what you mean.
s01_e24_c02_u037	Hey.
s01_e24_c02_u038	Hey.
s01_e24_c02_u039	Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)
s01_e24_c02_u040	How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
s01_e24_c02_u041	I'm going to China.
s01_e24_c02_u042	Jeez, you say one thing, and...
s01_e24_c02_u043	You're going to China?
s01_e24_c02_u044	Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo-it's-it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it to Monica)
s01_e24_c02_u045	Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)
s01_e24_c02_u046	(to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
s01_e24_c02_u047	Yeah.
s01_e24_c02_u048	Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture down, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
s01_e24_c02_u049	Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
s01_e24_c02_u050	Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
s01_e24_c02_u051	Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?
s01_e24_c02_u052	You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
s01_e24_c02_u053	No.
s01_e24_c02_u054	Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
s01_e24_c02_u055	At the coffeehouse, right.
s01_e24_c02_u056	So you do know who he is! (laughs, Ross stares at her) Sorry.
s01_e24_c02_u057	OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
s01_e24_c02_u058	Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
s01_e24_c02_u059	Hi.
s01_e24_c02_u060	Hey!
s01_e24_c02_u061	Hey!
s01_e24_c02_u062	(sigh)....I have to go to China.
s01_e24_c02_u063	The country?
s01_e24_c02_u064	No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
s01_e24_c02_u065	Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
s01_e24_c02_u066	Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
s01_e24_c02_u067	Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
s01_e24_c02_u068	Forget about her.
s01_e24_c02_u069	He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
s01_e24_c02_u070	Course there, they just call it food.
s01_e24_c02_u071	Yeah... I guess. I don't-I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)
s01_e24_c02_u072	Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
s01_e24_c02_u073	I know.
s01_e24_c02_u074	We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)
s01_e24_c02_u075	I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
s01_e24_c02_u076	Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
s01_e24_c02_u077	Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
s01_e24_c02_u078	(sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
s01_e24_c02_u079	(gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
s01_e24_c02_u080	Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)
s01_e24_c02_u081	Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
s01_e24_c02_u082	Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
s01_e24_c02_u083	Then you do. Heh, heh.
s01_e24_c02_u084	So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
s01_e24_c02_u085	What do you mean?
s01_e24_c02_u086	Y'know, just be there for her.
s01_e24_c02_u087	Not following you.
s01_e24_c02_u088	Think about it.
s01_e24_c02_u089	OK, I'm guessing this is from...
s01_e24_c02_u090	Well, thank you, Melanie.
s01_e24_c02_u091	(pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.
s01_e24_c02_u092	(picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it's... (opens it) Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)
s01_e24_c02_u093	This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!
s01_e24_c02_u094	Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
s01_e24_c02_u095	(to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times.
s01_e24_c02_u096	There is a little child inside this man!
s01_e24_c02_u097	Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
s01_e24_c02_u098	Who's this from?
s01_e24_c02_u099	Oh, that's Ross's.
s01_e24_c02_u100	Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
s01_e24_c02_u101	Remembered what?
s01_e24_c02_u102	It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
s01_e24_c02_u103	Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)
s01_e24_c02_u104	Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
s01_e24_c02_u105	I can't believe he did this.
s01_e24_c02_u106	Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
s01_e24_c02_u107	What did you just say?
s01_e24_c02_u108	(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
s01_e24_c02_u109	No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
s01_e24_c02_u110	(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
s01_e24_c02_u111	Oh.... my God.
s01_e24_c02_u112	(rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
s01_e24_c02_u113	(pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
s01_e24_c03_u114	I mean, this is unbelievable.
s01_e24_c03_u115	I know. This is really, really huge.
s01_e24_c03_u116	No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
s01_e24_c03_u117	Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
s01_e24_c03_u118	OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
s01_e24_c03_u119	I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
s01_e24_c03_u120	No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
s01_e24_c03_u121	Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
s01_e24_c03_u122	Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)
s01_e24_c03_u123	(quickly) H-He's in China!
s01_e24_c03_u124	The country.
s01_e24_c03_u125	No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
s01_e24_c03_u126	What about the time difference?
s01_e24_c03_u127	From here to the airport?
s01_e24_c03_u128	Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
s01_e24_c03_u129	Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
s01_e24_c03_u130	I-I-I don't know.
s01_e24_c03_u131	Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
s01_e24_c03_u132	He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
s01_e24_c03_u133	Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
s01_e24_c03_u134	I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
s01_e24_c03_u135	Here, look, alright, does this help?
s01_e24_c03_u136	Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)
s01_e24_c03_u137	Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
s01_e24_c04_u138	(something in Chinese)
s01_e24_c04_u139	Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
s01_e24_c04_u140	Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
s01_e24_c04_u141	Hi!
s01_e24_c04_u142	Hi.
s01_e24_c04_u143	May I see your boarding pass?
s01_e24_c04_u144	Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
s01_e24_c04_u145	Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
s01_e24_c04_u146	No, I know, but I-he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
s01_e24_c04_u147	No no no! Federal regulations!
s01_e24_c04_u148	OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
s01_e24_c04_u149	Alright. What's the message?
s01_e24_c04_u150	Uh... I don't know.
s01_e24_c04_u151	Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
s01_e24_c04_u152	(confused) What?
s01_e24_c04_u153	It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
s01_e24_c04_u154	(to wife): Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
s01_e24_c05_u155	Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
s01_e24_c05_u156	Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
s01_e24_c05_u157	Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing his chest)
s01_e24_c05_u158	(panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
s01_e24_c05_u159	(surprised) M-Me again?
s01_e24_c05_u160	Sure! Why not?
s01_e24_c05_u161	Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
s01_e24_c05_u162	Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
s01_e24_c05_u163	How do you mean?
s01_e24_c05_u164	I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
s01_e24_c06_u165	Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
s01_e24_c06_u166	I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
s01_e24_c06_u167	I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
s01_e24_c06_u168	Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
s01_e24_c06_u169	Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
s01_e24_c06_u170	Another good point.
s01_e24_c06_u171	No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
s01_e24_c06_u172	(confused) Huh?
s01_e24_c06_u173	Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
s01_e24_c06_u174	Why isn't it working out?
s01_e24_c06_u175	I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
s01_e24_c06_u176	Is he not cute enough for you?
s01_e24_c06_u177	No!
s01_e24_c06_u178	Does he not make enough money?
s01_e24_c06_u179	No, I'm just....
s01_e24_c06_u180	Maybe there's someone else.
s01_e24_c06_u181	Wha...
s01_e24_c06_u182	Is there? Is there someone else?
s01_e24_c06_u183	No! There is.. there is noone else!
s01_e24_c06_u184	Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
s01_e24_c07_u185	Hey, big...
s01_e24_c07_u186	Shhhh!
s01_e24_c07_u187	(quietly) ...spender.
s01_e24_c07_u188	She's still asleep.
s01_e24_c07_u189	So how'd it go?
s01_e24_c07_u190	Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
s01_e24_c07_u191	The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
s01_e24_c07_u192	Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
s01_e24_c07_u193	Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
s01_e24_c07_u194	It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
s01_e24_c07_u195	I didn't know you had another level.
s01_e24_c07_u196	I know! Neither did I!
s01_e24_c08_u197	Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
s01_e24_c08_u198	Yeah.
s01_e24_c08_u199	Oh, from who?
s01_e24_c08_u200	From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
s01_e24_c08_u201	Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
s01_e24_c08_u202	Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this-this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
s01_e24_c08_u203	Oh, why?
s01_e24_c08_u204	Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
s01_e24_c08_u205	(gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
s01_e24_c08_u206	Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
s01_e24_c08_u207	I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
s01_e24_c08_u208	Who is it?
s01_e24_c08_u209	It's me, Carl.
s01_e24_c08_u210	C'mon up.
s01_e24_c08_u211	Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
s01_e24_c09_u212	Seven hundred bucks!
s01_e24_c09_u213	Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
s01_e24_c09_u214	Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
s01_e24_c09_u215	Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
s01_e24_c09_u216	What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)
s01_e24_c10_u217	I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
s01_e24_c10_u218	I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
s01_e24_c10_u219	Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
s01_e24_c10_u220	Fine, just stop thinking about me.
s01_e24_c10_u221	Can't do it, can you?
s01_e24_c10_u222	So I'm thinking about you. So what?
s01_e24_c10_u223	I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
s01_e24_c10_u224	Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
s01_e24_c10_u225	I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
s01_e24_c10_u226	Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
s01_e24_c10_u227	Ross, it's too hard.
s01_e24_c10_u228	No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
s01_e24_c10_u229	Ross, you're like my best friend.
s01_e24_c10_u230	I know.
s01_e24_c10_u231	If we broke up, and I lost you...
s01_e24_c10_u232	Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
s01_e24_c10_u233	Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
s01_e24_c10_u234	(pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
s01_e24_c10_u235	I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
s01_e24_c10_u236	Well, start looking.
s01_e24_c10_u237	Wow.
s01_e24_c10_u238	Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
s01_e24_c10_u239	Right! You're right!
s01_e24_c10_u240	Heh... y'know?
s01_e24_c10_u241	You know what?
s01_e24_c10_u242	What?
s01_e24_c10_u243	I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) I mean-I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
s01_e24_c10_u244	But...
s01_e24_c11_u245	(sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
s01_e24_c11_u246	For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
s01_e24_c11_u247	Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
s01_e24_c11_u248	Oh, thanks, sweetie.
s01_e24_c11_u249	No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
s01_e24_c11_u250	Really?
s01_e24_c11_u251	Yeah.
s01_e24_c11_u252	You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
s01_e24_c11_u253	No, no, they will. I just... uh...
s01_e24_c11_u254	Come on, they're gonna love you.
s07_e14_c01_u001	Happy birthday!!!
s07_e14_c01_u002	Happy birthday!!!
s07_e14_c01_u003	Rach! Come on! Rach!
s07_e14_c01_u004	It's your birthday!
s07_e14_c01_u005	(entering from her room) Hey.
s07_e14_c01_u006	(To Monica) She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
s07_e14_c01_u007	Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or (To Joey) they still look pretty damn good. (Joey smiles and everyone glares at him.)
s07_e14_c01_u008	They do!
s07_e14_c01_u009	Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
s07_e14_c01_u010	Chocolate-chip pancakes!
s07_e14_c01_u011	We've got presents!
s07_e14_c01_u012	Good ones?
s07_e14_c01_u013	They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
s07_e14_c01_u014	Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
s07_e14_c01_u015	Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
s07_e14_c01_u016	Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
s07_e14_c01_u017	(screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! (He buries his head in Phoebe's lap for comfort.)
s07_e14_c01_u018	Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.
s07_e14_c01_u019	Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
s07_e14_c01_u020	Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
s07_e14_c01_u021	No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
s07_e14_c01_u022	(screaming) And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! (Looking up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)
s07_e14_c02_u023	Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends
s07_e14_c02_u024	Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.
s07_e14_c02_u025	Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty.
s07_e14_c02_u026	Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
s07_e14_c02_u027	Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
s07_e14_c02_u028	There you go!
s07_e14_c02_u029	I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head into Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)
s07_e14_c03_u030	Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
s07_e14_c03_u031	Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? (To Rachel) What do you want to do today?
s07_e14_c03_u032	Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
s07_e14_c03_u033	Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
s07_e14_c03_u034	Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
s07_e14_c03_u035	How hot do I look in this, huh?!
s07_e14_c03_u036	Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
s07_e14_c03_u037	That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
s07_e14_c03_u038	Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?
s07_e14_c03_u039	(giddy) I don't know, but-but look how shiny!
s07_e14_c03_u040	I can't believe you bought this.
s07_e14_c03_u041	Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
s07_e14_c03_u042	Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?
s07_e14_c03_u043	Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
s07_e14_c03_u044	Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)
s07_e14_c03_u045	(getting out) Okay, who's next?
s07_e14_c04_u046	Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
s07_e14_c04_u047	Really?! Cause y'know that hurts.
s07_e14_c04_u048	So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it-(Phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head)-Ow! Son of a bitch!!
s07_e14_c04_u049	Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25.
s07_e14_c04_u050	(glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment.
s07_e14_c04_u051	All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
s07_e14_c04_u052	Least of all you.
s07_e14_c04_u053	Why? What you'd do?
s07_e14_c04_u054	Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
s07_e14_c04_u055	(To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
s07_e14_c04_u056	But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
s07_e14_c04_u057	(frustrated) Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.
s07_e14_c04_u058	(To Chandler) You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
s07_e14_c04_u059	Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller's shoulder.)
s07_e14_c04_u060	It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
s07_e14_c04_u061	Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
s07_e14_c04_u062	(entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
s07_e14_c04_u063	Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)
s07_e14_c04_u064	Crap.
s07_e14_c04_u065	(getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
s07_e14_c04_u066	Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)
s07_e14_c04_u067	Hey-hey are you drunk?
s07_e14_c04_u068	Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and Joey's doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. (Pause) I wanna puke on you later!
s07_e14_c04_u069	Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
s07_e14_c04_u070	Noo!!!
s07_e14_c04_u071	Yes!
s07_e14_c04_u072	Noo!!
s07_e14_c04_u073	Yes!!
s07_e14_c04_u074	Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.
s07_e14_c04_u075	Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
s07_e14_c04_u076	Really?! You promise?
s07_e14_c04_u077	Yeah, I'll take care of it.
s07_e14_c04_u078	Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)
s07_e14_c04_u079	(laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.
s07_e14_c04_u080	What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)
s07_e14_c04_u081	That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
s07_e14_c04_u082	Okay. I can do that.
s07_e14_c04_u083	Okay.
s07_e14_c04_u084	Surprise!!!
s07_e14_c05_u085	Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to the back of the car.) Okay, back-Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to the front.) Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!
s07_e14_c05_u086	Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in.
s07_e14_c05_u087	(To Joey) Is this yours?
s07_e14_c05_u088	Well actually
s07_e14_c05_u089	No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine. (The woman walks away.)
s07_e14_c05_u090	Dude, you soooo need this car.
s07_e14_c05_u091	(running up) Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel. She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!! (Runs off.)
s07_e14_c06_u092	Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
s07_e14_c06_u093	Right, why do you keep saying that?
s07_e14_c06_u094	Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
s07_e14_c06_u095	Yeah, no we're not thirty. We're 31. Okay. (She closes the door.)
s07_e14_c06_u096	Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)
s07_e14_c06_u097	Oh, it's you.
s07_e14_c06_u098	Yeah. What?!
s07_e14_c06_u099	Yeah, we're not thirty, we're 31.
s07_e14_c06_u100	Nu-uh!
s07_e14_c06_u101	Yea-huh! That's what is says on my birth certificate.
s07_e14_c06_u102	You have your birth certificate?
s07_e14_c06_u103	Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
s07_e14_c06_u104	Our mom.
s07_e14_c06_u105	(sarcastic) Right! Okay. (Hands Phoebe her births certificate.)
s07_e14_c06_u106	Do you have my birth certificate?
s07_e14_c06_u107	No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
s07_e14_c06_u108	(reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
s07_e14_c06_u109	Yeah.
s07_e14_c06_u110	I just lost a whole year of my life.
s07_e14_c06_u111	(sarcastic) Okay.
s07_e14_c06_u112	Your middle name is Pamela?
s07_e14_c06_u113	Yes.
s07_e14_c06_u114	Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
s07_e14_c06_u115	Yes! Phoebe.
s07_e14_c06_u116	That's my first name.
s07_e14_c06_u117	Right, okay, then no.
s07_e14_c07_u118	Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
s07_e14_c07_u119	Yay!
s07_e14_c07_u120	See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who's sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller who's standing next to him.)
s07_e14_c07_u121	Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug! (Starts to get up.)
s07_e14_c07_u122	(stopping him) Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
s07_e14_c07_u123	(sees someone) Paul!
s07_e14_c07_u124	(correcting her) Phil.
s07_e14_c07_u125	Phil!
s07_e14_c07_u126	Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her) you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine.
s07_e14_c07_u127	Hey, what's going on?
s07_e14_c07_u128	Monica's a little drunk.
s07_e14_c07_u129	Yay! I love drunk Monica!
s07_e14_c07_u130	Awwwww- (Giggles.)
s07_e14_c07_u131	(To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
s07_e14_c07_u132	Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.
s07_e14_c07_u133	What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
s07_e14_c07_u134	Monica's wasted.
s07_e14_c07_u135	Maybe that will liven up this party.
s07_e14_c07_u136	(To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!
s07_e14_c07_u137	Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
s07_e14_c07_u138	Yep. (Starts for Monica's room, but Chandler stops him.)
s07_e14_c08_u139	(handing his to her) This one's from me.
s07_e14_c08_u140	Ahh!
s07_e14_c08_u141	It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
s07_e14_c08_u142	(opening it) A scooter! (She's not happy.)
s07_e14_c08_u143	(to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
s07_e14_c08_u144	No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)
s07_e14_c08_u145	Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
s07_e14_c08_u146	Okay.
s07_e14_c08_u147	Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
s07_e14_c08_u148	For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read the card! Read the card!
s07_e14_c08_u149	Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That's funny, yeah!
s07_e14_c08_u150	No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
s07_e14_c08_u151	(crying) No, I know! I get it! It's funny!
s07_e14_c08_u152	No, because you're not a grandmother!
s07_e14_c08_u153	No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny. (Runs into her room crying.)
s07_e14_c08_u154	All you had to do was buy the card!
s07_e14_c09_u155	Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
s07_e14_c09_u156	Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
s07_e14_c09_u157	What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)
s07_e14_c09_u158	Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids
s07_e14_c09_u159	Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
s07_e14_c09_u160	As I was saying- I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
s07_e14_c09_u161	If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.
s07_e14_c09_u162	So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant
s07_e14_c09_u163	Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To Chandler) Look all you want, it's happening!
s07_e14_c09_u164	No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged- Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.
s07_e14_c09_u165	Which is fine! Because you just turned-(Removes two candles from the cake)-twenty-eight!
s07_e14_c09_u166	No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
s07_e14_c09_u167	Will you quit hoggin' it!
s07_e14_c10_u168	(To Chandler) I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
s07_e14_c10_u169	(To Monica) You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
s07_e14_c10_u170	(to a waiter) Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.
s07_e14_c10_u171	(to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
s07_e14_c10_u172	(To Monica) How are you feeling?
s07_e14_c10_u173	You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)
s07_e14_c10_u174	I really wish that you wouldn't.
s07_e14_c10_u175	(To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
s07_e14_c10_u176	(clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
s07_e14_c10_u177	Pheebs!!
s07_e14_c10_u178	Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
s07_e14_c10_u179	Speech! Come on Monica!
s07_e14_c10_u180	Come on!
s07_e14_c10_u181	Come on! Speech!
s07_e14_c10_u182	(filming this) Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!
s07_e14_c10_u183	Oh-ho, I think it's nice.
s07_e14_c10_u184	I think it's necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)
s07_e14_c10_u185	I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends
s07_e14_c10_u186	(screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!
s07_e14_c10_u187	I really like to say that I'm-um- (Pause) Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.) That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera out of his dad's hands.) And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming the fall.)
s07_e14_c10_u188	(To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)
s07_e14_c10_u189	Yeah!!
s07_e14_c11_u190	I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
s07_e14_c11_u191	Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.
s07_e14_c11_u192	Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
s07_e14_c11_u193	That's not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!
s07_e14_c11_u194	Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I-I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
s07_e14_c11_u195	Like what?
s07_e14_c11_u196	Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!
s07_e14_c11_u197	Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
s07_e14_c11_u198	No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)
s07_e14_c11_u199	Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs.
s07_e14_c11_u200	Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home. (Gets up and runs out.)
s07_e14_c11_u201	Oh man!
s07_e14_c11_u202	What?
s07_e14_c11_u203	He's gonna eat the cake!
s07_e14_c11_u204	Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
s07_e14_c11_u205	Oh yeah.
s07_e14_c11_u206	Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese.
s07_e14_c11_u207	Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)
s07_e14_c12_u208	Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up-and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car-and slide it out. Lift and slide!
s07_e14_c12_u209	Ross, I really don't think
s07_e14_c12_u210	(interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!
s07_e14_c12_u211	Okay, here we go.
s07_e14_c12_u212	All right everyone, lift! (They and try to lift the car, of course it doesn't raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)
s07_e14_c13_u213	Hey Joey, can I
s07_e14_c13_u214	Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
s07_e14_c13_u215	Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.
s07_e14_c13_u216	Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
s07_e14_c13_u217	Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.
s07_e14_c13_u218	Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)
s07_e14_c13_u219	Not in the street!!
s07_e14_c13_u220	Yes!
s07_e14_c13_u221	(to Tag) Hi.
s07_e14_c13_u222	Hey.
s07_e14_c13_u223	Hey.
s07_e14_c13_u224	How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
s07_e14_c13_u225	Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um-let's talk.
s07_e14_c13_u226	Okay. (They sit on the step.)
s07_e14_c13_u227	Umm
s07_e14_c13_u228	What's up?
s07_e14_c13_u229	Ohh Tag, umm-you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't
s07_e14_c13_u230	Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing? (Kisses her.)
s07_e14_c13_u231	Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun.
s07_e14_c13_u232	Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty.
s07_e14_c13_u233	Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!
s07_e14_c13_u234	Twenty-four actually.
s07_e14_c13_u235	Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
s07_e14_c13_u236	Me too.
s07_e14_c13_u237	Yeah, I'm sorry. (They hug.)
s07_e14_c13_u238	Hey! How'd it go?
s07_e14_c13_u239	Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
s07_e14_c13_u240	You did the right thing.
s07_e14_c13_u241	(entering, limping, and holding his arm) I don't like this anymore. (He sits down with them in pain.)
s07_e14_c13_u242	Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
s07_e14_c13_u243	God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?
s07_e14_c13_u244	(crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in Ross's shoulder.)
s07_e14_c14_u245	Yes! My baby's finally free!
s07_e14_c14_u246	All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Let's go!
s07_e14_c14_u247	(starting it) Woohoo!
s07_e14_c14_u248	How hot are we? (He drives off.)
s07_e14_c14_u249	You wanna buy a car?
s07_e14_c14_u250	No.
s04_e04_c01_u001	Hey! New wallet, huh?
s04_e04_c01_u002	Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say cool' anymore.
s04_e04_c01_u003	Rachel!
s04_e04_c01_u004	What?
s04_e04_c01_u005	You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
s04_e04_c01_u006	Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
s04_e04_c01_u007	Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)
s04_e04_c01_u008	Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door and stops.)
s04_e04_c01_u009	Third door on the left.
s04_e04_c01_u010	Right!
s04_e04_c02_u011	Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
s04_e04_c02_u012	: Hey.
s04_e04_c02_u013	: What are you doing?
s04_e04_c02_u014	Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.) It's a little old but
s04_e04_c02_u015	: No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
s04_e04_c02_u016	I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
s04_e04_c02_u017	: Oh yeah, of course you don't!
s04_e04_c02_u018	No.
s04_e04_c02_u019	: Cause you're a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me-"
s04_e04_c02_u020	I didn't- I never said that.
s04_e04_c02_u021	: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
s04_e04_c02_u022	(starting to cry) Okay, I'm sorry. (Runs out still carrying the pizza box.)
s04_e04_c02_u023	God! If you're gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]
s04_e04_c03_u024	Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
s04_e04_c03_u025	Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
s04_e04_c03_u026	I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
s04_e04_c03_u027	Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
s04_e04_c03_u028	That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.
s04_e04_c03_u029	All right that's it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the door.)
s04_e04_c03_u030	(Picking up a card from Chandler's wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?
s04_e04_c03_u031	Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
s04_e04_c03_u032	So why don't you quit?
s04_e04_c03_u033	You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
s04_e04_c03_u034	Who is Maria?
s04_e04_c03_u035	Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym-treat.
s04_e04_c03_u036	You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
s04_e04_c03_u037	No!
s04_e04_c03_u038	So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
s04_e04_c03_u039	Oh no, you'll have to come.
s04_e04_c04_u040	: Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.
s04_e04_c04_u041	Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
s04_e04_c04_u042	: And tell him what?
s04_e04_c04_u043	Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
s04_e04_c04_u044	: Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
s04_e04_c04_u045	I have actually not heard of that.
s04_e04_c04_u046	: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.
s04_e04_c04_u047	Why don't you tell me something I don't know! (He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an Oops!' have.)
s04_e04_c05_u048	Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
s04_e04_c05_u049	What's the matter?
s04_e04_c05_u050	Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
s04_e04_c05_u051	So do them for free.
s04_e04_c05_u052	Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
s04_e04_c05_u053	They make you take an oath?
s04_e04_c05_u054	No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
s04_e04_c05_u055	Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
s04_e04_c05_u056	No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional. (She starts to leave)
s04_e04_c05_u057	Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
s04_e04_c05_u058	Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
s04_e04_c05_u059	Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
s04_e04_c05_u060	You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
s04_e04_c05_u061	I don't what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to leaqve)
s04_e04_c05_u062	Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
s04_e04_c05_u063	Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
s04_e04_c05_u064	Oh! My hero! What happened?
s04_e04_c05_u065	Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later. (Starts to leave)
s04_e04_c05_u066	What a minute, what did he say?
s04_e04_c05_u067	He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
s04_e04_c05_u068	What?! You got us evicted!!
s04_e04_c05_u069	I told you not to go down there!
s04_e04_c05_u070	Well he made Rachel cry!
s04_e04_c05_u071	Rachel always cries!
s04_e04_c05_u072	That's not true! (Starts to cry.)
s04_e04_c05_u073	Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
s04_e04_c05_u074	All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
s04_e04_c05_u075	Go!!
s04_e04_c05_u076	All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns around) I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)
s04_e04_c06_u077	Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
s04_e04_c06_u078	Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
s04_e04_c06_u079	One more time, "Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
s04_e04_c06_u080	No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
s04_e04_c06_u081	Good! That's good!
s04_e04_c06_u082	Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
s04_e04_c06_u083	You wanna quit?
s04_e04_c06_u084	I wanna quit the gym.
s04_e04_c06_u085	You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
s04_e04_c06_u086	(He turns to Ross and Ross makes a Be strong' sound.) I wanna quit the gym.
s04_e04_c06_u087	Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters. (Both Chandler and Ross start to make their way to the membership office.) Uh, excuse me, (to Ross) are you a member?
s04_e04_c06_u088	Me? No.
s04_e04_c06_u089	Sorry, members only.
s04_e04_c06_u090	(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.
s04_e04_c06_u091	It's okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)
s04_e04_c06_u092	(to Ross) So, are you a member of any gym.
s04_e04_c06_u093	No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
s04_e04_c06_u094	Okay, no problem. (To someone out of the picture) Could you come here for a second?
s04_e04_c06_u095	Hi, I'm Maria.
s04_e04_c07_u096	(looking at her feet) Wow, you have really pretty feet.
s04_e04_c07_u097	These old things.
s04_e04_c07_u098	Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
s04_e04_c07_u099	You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
s04_e04_c07_u100	Yeah.
s04_e04_c07_u101	Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
s04_e04_c07_u102	Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
s04_e04_c07_u103	Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)
s04_e04_c07_u104	Ow! Did you just bite me?
s04_e04_c07_u105	No!
s04_e04_c08_u106	: What?
s04_e04_c08_u107	Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
s04_e04_c08_u108	: You want me to kick you guys out instead?
s04_e04_c08_u109	No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
s04_e04_c08_u110	: You have pets!
s04_e04_c08_u111	Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
s04_e04_c08_u112	: Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.
s04_e04_c08_u113	Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want.
s04_e04_c08_u114	: Really? You'll do anything?
s04_e04_c08_u115	Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
s04_e04_c08_u116	: Yeah, I've got something you can do.
s04_e04_c08_u117	What, what is it?
s04_e04_c08_u118	: Can you be my dancing partner?
s04_e04_c08_u119	That's not, prison lingo, is it?
s04_e04_c09_u120	His dancing partner?!
s04_e04_c09_u121	Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
s04_e04_c09_u122	Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
s04_e04_c09_u123	Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
s04_e04_c09_u124	Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that-garbage chute. (Starts to cry)
s04_e04_c09_u125	Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!
s04_e04_c09_u126	Hey.
s04_e04_c09_u127	Hey! So, did you quit?
s04_e04_c09_u128	No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
s04_e04_c09_u129	Wait, now so you joined the gym?
s04_e04_c09_u130	And that's funny, why?
s04_e04_c09_u131	Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm- Oh, that's it.
s04_e04_c09_u132	We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
s04_e04_c09_u133	Well, you could actually go to the gym.
s04_e04_c09_u134	Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
s04_e04_c09_u135	You're a genius!
s04_e04_c09_u136	Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!
s04_e04_c09_u137	Now, there's two reasons.
s04_e04_c09_u138	(entering) Hey.
s04_e04_c09_u139	Hey!
s04_e04_c09_u140	Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
s04_e04_c09_u141	Where?!
s04_e04_c09_u142	On the touchy.
s04_e04_c09_u143	And that's not against your oath?!
s04_e04_c09_u144	No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
s04_e04_c09_u145	Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
s04_e04_c09_u146	Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
s04_e04_c09_u147	Thank you, Joey.
s04_e04_c09_u148	No-no, thank you.
s04_e04_c10_u149	All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.
s04_e04_c10_u150	: Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead. (Turns on some music)
s04_e04_c10_u151	Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?
s04_e04_c10_u152	: Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
s04_e04_c10_u153	: Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
s04_e04_c10_u154	No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
s04_e04_c10_u155	: Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
s04_e04_c10_u156	Come on man, you're not a potato.
s04_e04_c10_u157	: I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.
s04_e04_c10_u158	Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. (they start dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a-(Treeger throws him) We-he!! Hey!
s04_e04_c10_u159	: Yeah!
s04_e04_c11_u160	Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
s04_e04_c11_u161	Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a little dance step on the way.)
s04_e04_c11_u162	(laughing) What was that?
s04_e04_c11_u163	What?
s04_e04_c11_u164	You just did a little dancy thing.
s04_e04_c11_u165	No I didn't.
s04_e04_c11_u166	Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
s04_e04_c11_u167	You are soo enjoying this.
s04_e04_c11_u168	No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
s04_e04_c11_u169	(laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!
s04_e04_c11_u170	All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
s04_e04_c11_u171	Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
s04_e04_c11_u172	Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
s04_e04_c11_u173	All right, then show me some manly moves.
s04_e04_c11_u174	All right.
s04_e04_c11_u175	I don't know how to lead.
s04_e04_c12_u176	Hello.
s04_e04_c12_u177	Hi.
s04_e04_c12_u178	We'd like to close our accounts.
s04_e04_c12_u179	Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
s04_e04_c12_u180	No-no.
s04_e04_c12_u181	No, we'd just like to close them.
s04_e04_c12_u182	Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures. (to a beautiful woman) Would you come over here please?
s04_e04_c12_u183	Hi, I'm Karen.
s04_e04_c12_u184	I wanna quit the bank!
s04_e04_c13_u185	(thinking to herself) Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little- Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working.
s04_e04_c13_u186	(thinking to herself) Chandler's knees. Chandler's- ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. (notices the clock) Oh no. (to Rick) Okay, you're all set.
s04_e04_c13_u187	Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
s04_e04_c13_u188	Yeah! In- really long hour world.
s04_e04_c13_u189	What?
s04_e04_c13_u190	Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling.
s04_e04_c13_u191	Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
s04_e04_c13_u192	Really?!
s04_e04_c13_u193	Yeah, really.
s04_e04_c13_u194	What?
s04_e04_c13_u195	Suddenly, I very aware that I'm naked.
s04_e04_c13_u196	(laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)
s04_e04_c13_u197	Mr. Simon's been waiting for-(sees Phoebe and Rick) Oh my God!
s04_e04_c13_u198	Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.
s04_e04_c13_u199	Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
s04_e04_c13_u200	Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, cause Rick is my ahh, husband.
s04_e04_c13_u201	Oh really? Well, then you'd better tell his other wife, cause she called three times asking where he is.
s04_e04_c13_u202	Yes, I will tell her.
s04_e04_c14_u203	So you didn't leave the bank?
s04_e04_c14_u204	No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
s04_e04_c14_u205	What are you ever gonna use that for?!
s04_e04_c14_u206	To pay for the gym.
s04_e04_c14_u207	Hey.
s04_e04_c14_u208	Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
s04_e04_c14_u209	What?!
s04_e04_c14_u210	You got fired?!
s04_e04_c14_u211	Oh my Gosh!
s04_e04_c14_u212	It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
s04_e04_c14_u213	Sweety...
s04_e04_c14_u214	I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise.
s04_e04_c14_u215	: Hey Duck, is Chick here?
s04_e04_c14_u216	Yeah- Bunny-rabbit.
s04_e04_c14_u217	(To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?
s04_e04_c14_u218	: Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.
s04_e04_c14_u219	Look, you wanna use our place?
s04_e04_c14_u220	: No, I ahh, had another idea.
s04_e04_c14_u221	We did it!!
s04_e04_c14_u222	: I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
s04_e04_c14_u223	I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
s04_e04_c14_u224	: Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, (checks watch). Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
s04_e04_c14_u225	Oh well, okay, good luck.
s04_e04_c14_u226	: Yeah.
s04_e04_c14_u227	Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
s04_e04_c14_u228	: Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
s04_e04_c14_u229	Okay.
s04_e04_c14_u230	: Yeah.
s04_e04_c14_u231	Go get em Treeger.
s04_e04_c14_u232	: Right. (Starts to leave) Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
s04_e04_c14_u233	(intrigued) Really?
s04_e04_c14_u234	: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.
s04_e04_c14_u235	No, I'm good.
s04_e04_c15_u236	So it looks like you've got some great experience here. Let's see ahh, reason for leaving last job?
s04_e04_c15_u237	Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
s04_e04_c15_u238	Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
s04_e04_c15_u239	Great! Thank you very much.
s08_e19_c01_u001	Hi!
s08_e19_c01_u002	Hey!
s08_e19_c01_u003	Hey!
s08_e19_c01_u004	So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to Joey.)
s08_e19_c01_u005	(reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me!! I'm blank!!
s08_e19_c01_u006	How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down! (She has her hand on his shoulder.)
s08_e19_c01_u007	Yeah you are baby.
s08_e19_c01_u008	Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?
s08_e19_c01_u009	So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
s08_e19_c01_u010	No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
s08_e19_c01_u011	Why'd you say no?
s08_e19_c01_u012	Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
s08_e19_c01_u013	If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)
s08_e19_c01_u014	Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?
s08_e19_c01_u015	Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
s08_e19_c01_u016	Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
s08_e19_c01_u017	Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.
s08_e19_c01_u018	Just then or-or all the time, cause we-we have jobs y'know.
s08_e19_c01_u019	Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.
s08_e19_c01_u020	Yeah.
s08_e19_c02_u021	I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
s08_e19_c02_u022	Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
s08_e19_c02_u023	(To Chandler) You think we're being obvious?
s08_e19_c02_u024	No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)
s08_e19_c02_u025	(To Joey) Y'know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y'know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.
s08_e19_c02_u026	(laughs) Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
s08_e19_c02_u027	Umm, I'll have a cup of coffee.
s08_e19_c02_u028	And I'll have all the muffins.
s08_e19_c02_u029	(entering) Hey!
s08_e19_c02_u030	Shhh! We're not talking.
s08_e19_c02_u031	Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)
s08_e19_c02_u032	So, according to your bio, you've done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives. Anything you're particularly proud of?
s08_e19_c02_u033	(He goes into a song and dance number)
s08_e19_c02_u034	Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!
s08_e19_c02_u035	(finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.
s08_e19_c02_u036	Yeah, I guess it is. And so- I'm gonna get on this spaceship, (Smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. (Gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne- baby-I'm gonna want to meet her.
s08_e19_c02_u037	Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do-so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) you know that's bad for the paper tray.
s08_e19_c02_u038	Nice work my friend.
s08_e19_c02_u039	Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am
s08_e19_c02_u040	Well, there are so many things, it's hard to pick just one.
s08_e19_c02_u041	I'm gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
s08_e19_c02_u042	Oh yeah, I'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
s08_e19_c02_u043	Uh, double latte, extra foam.
s08_e19_c02_u044	And a bagel with only
s08_e19_c02_u045	(interrupting him) I was just being polite!
s08_e19_c02_u046	Okay, how about when you're not working. What do you do in your spare time?
s08_e19_c02_u047	(drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
s08_e19_c02_u048	That is the Coast Guard.
s08_e19_c02_u049	What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there. (Points to the coast.)
s08_e19_c02_u050	(entering) Hey!
s08_e19_c02_u051	Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
s08_e19_c02_u052	(To Chandler) Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
s08_e19_c03_u053	Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
s08_e19_c03_u054	(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
s08_e19_c03_u055	All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
s08_e19_c03_u056	Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
s08_e19_c03_u057	Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
s08_e19_c03_u058	I think you're right.
s08_e19_c03_u059	All right, ready?
s08_e19_c03_u060	One.
s08_e19_c03_u061	Two.
s08_e19_c03_u062	That's kinda nice.
s08_e19_c03_u063	Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
s08_e19_c03_u064	Yeah.
s08_e19_c03_u065	You wanna see if we still have it?
s08_e19_c03_u066	Yeah.
s08_e19_c03_u067	FREE PORN!!!
s08_e19_c03_u068	Yeah!!
s08_e19_c03_u069	We have free porn here!!!
s08_e19_c03_u070	In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I'm also a mento for the kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y'know a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites his fist to keep from talking.)
s08_e19_c03_u071	A mento
s08_e19_c03_u072	Right.
s08_e19_c03_u073	Like the candy?
s08_e19_c03_u074	Matter of fact, I do.
s08_e19_c03_u075	Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?
s08_e19_c03_u076	Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
s08_e19_c03_u077	Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
s08_e19_c03_u078	Are you serious?!
s08_e19_c03_u079	Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
s08_e19_c03_u080	Wow! We are pretty good at this!
s08_e19_c03_u081	Yeah!
s08_e19_c03_u082	Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
s08_e19_c03_u083	Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
s08_e19_c04_u084	What's wrong with you?
s08_e19_c04_u085	Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
s08_e19_c04_u086	This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you-Go to the doctor!
s08_e19_c04_u087	No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.) Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.) Damn you 15s!
s08_e19_c04_u088	It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something's wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
s08_e19_c04_u089	It tastes like feet!
s08_e19_c04_u090	I like it.
s08_e19_c04_u091	Are you kidding?
s08_e19_c04_u092	What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.
s08_e19_c05_u093	The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?
s08_e19_c05_u094	That's still in there?!
s08_e19_c05_u095	Not anymore.
s08_e19_c06_u096	Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
s08_e19_c06_u097	Stick to your side!
s08_e19_c06_u098	Hey, come on now!
s08_e19_c06_u099	(pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin'? (Starts digging in.)
s08_e19_c06_u100	Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.
s08_e19_c06_u101	I'll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.
s08_e19_c06_u102	Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
s08_e19_c06_u103	It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn't have said. But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.
s08_e19_c06_u104	Understood. So, what'd you say back then?
s08_e19_c06_u105	Well, I said that I- (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)
s08_e19_c07_u106	You guys, this is Shelley, she's interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends
s08_e19_c07_u107	(interrupting him) Hi! I'm gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too. This might be Joey's baby (rubbing her stomach), who knows? I'm just kidding-Seriously, (leans into the cassette recorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.
s08_e19_c07_u108	(leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
s08_e19_c07_u109	Umm, I'm gonna just go get this warmed up. (She takes her coffee mug up to the counter.)
s08_e19_c07_u110	Okay.
s08_e19_c07_u111	Joey! You're doing great!
s08_e19_c07_u112	Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
s08_e19_c07_u113	Mento?
s08_e19_c07_u114	No thanks.
s08_e19_c07_u115	(returning) So, as Joey's friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?
s08_e19_c07_u116	Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
s08_e19_c07_u117	(scoffs at him) Yeah, that's gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I-(leans into the microphone again)-I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
s08_e19_c07_u118	Umm, I-I just think you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
s08_e19_c07_u119	Oh! I like that. What's your name?
s08_e19_c07_u120	Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
s08_e19_c07_u121	How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
s08_e19_c07_u122	Oh okay, it's P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) Ello there mate!
s08_e19_c07_u123	Great! Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
s08_e19_c07_u124	Yeah, you too.
s08_e19_c07_u125	You too!
s08_e19_c07_u126	Thanks.
s08_e19_c07_u127	Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)
s08_e19_c07_u128	So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
s08_e19_c07_u129	How come you have two? Chandler: Well this one's for you. Get out. Chandler: No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, (Puts bracelet on Joey) it's about you and me and the fact that we're (Reading bracelet) best buds. Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. Chandler: That's what they'll call us. [The next one is from Episode 618: The One Where Ross Dates A Student.]
s08_e19_c08_u130	Oh, Joey! Sorry!
s08_e19_c08_u131	No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
s08_e19_c08_u132	Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
s08_e19_c08_u133	Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
s08_e19_c08_u134	Really?
s08_e19_c08_u135	Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
s08_e19_c08_u136	I've never lived like this before.
s08_e19_c08_u137	I know.
s08_e19_c08_u138	All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and eats it.)
s08_e19_c09_u139	All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).
s08_e19_c09_u140	Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
s08_e19_c09_u141	All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
s08_e19_c09_u142	Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
s08_e19_c09_u143	Judge rules, no violation.
s08_e19_c09_u144	Ohhh.
s08_e19_c09_u145	And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
s08_e19_c09_u146	(turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
s08_e19_c09_u147	Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
s08_e19_c09_u148	Ohh, tough call.
s08_e19_c09_u149	Yeah.
s08_e19_c09_u150	I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
s08_e19_c09_u151	Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (Stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
s08_e19_c09_u152	You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So... (Looks at Joey.)
s08_e19_c09_u153	That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!
s08_e19_c09_u154	Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
s08_e19_c09_u155	So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
s08_e19_c09_u156	Really? Me? Wow! I don't even know any huge gay people!
s08_e19_c09_u157	It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
s08_e19_c09_u158	Now, off the record, you're not
s08_e19_c09_u159	What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
s08_e19_c09_u160	Your make-up!
s08_e19_c09_u161	Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
s08_e19_c09_u162	I think face to face.
s08_e19_c09_u163	I would say that.
s08_e19_c09_u164	Face to face, yeah!
s08_e19_c09_u165	Okay, here I go.
s08_e19_c09_u166	All right.
s08_e19_c09_u167	(grunting) Oh my- How much do you weigh Ross?!
s08_e19_c09_u168	I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
s08_e19_c09_u169	Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
s08_e19_c10_u170	Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
s08_e19_c10_u171	Hey!
s08_e19_c10_u172	Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that he's got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!
s08_e19_c10_u173	Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
s08_e19_c10_u174	You're turning into a woman.
s08_e19_c10_u175	No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
s08_e19_c10_u176	Now I've upset you? What did I say?
s08_e19_c10_u177	It's not what you said. It's the way you said it- Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!
s08_e19_c11_u178	Great nap.
s08_e19_c11_u179	It really was.
s08_e19_c11_u180	Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are. (Chandler and Ross look at each other.)
s08_e19_c11_u181	So, let's talk about women. I'm sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
s08_e19_c11_u182	Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
s08_e19_c11_u183	Oh, please!
s08_e19_c11_u184	(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin'?
s08_e19_c12_u185	Hey! How you doin'?
s08_e19_c12_u186	(to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
s08_e19_c12_u187	I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)
s08_e19_c12_u188	Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
s08_e19_c12_u189	Oh my God, Jill!
s08_e19_c12_u190	Oh my God, Rachel!
s08_e19_c12_u191	Oh my God, introduce us!
s08_e19_c12_u192	This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
s08_e19_c12_u193	Hi!
s08_e19_c12_u194	And you know Monica and Ross!
s08_e19_c12_u195	Hi Jill.
s08_e19_c12_u196	And that's Phoebe (points), and that's Joey.
s08_e19_c12_u197	Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin'?
s08_e19_c12_u198	Don't!! (Joey backs away frightened.)
s08_e19_c12_u199	No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
s08_e19_c12_u200	Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
s08_e19_c12_u201	I don't think so.
s08_e19_c12_u202	Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?
s08_e19_c12_u203	I'm okay.
s08_e19_c12_u204	What?!?! Oh dear God!
s08_e19_c12_u205	Not much to tell there I'm really shy.
s08_e19_c12_u206	So, that's it. I guess that's all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
s08_e19_c12_u207	Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)
s08_e19_c12_u208	Bye.
s08_e19_c12_u209	Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the gang.) I did it!
s08_e19_c12_u210	Yeah!
s08_e19_c12_u211	Amazing! Amazing!
s08_e19_c12_u212	(returning) Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what's your favorite soap opera?
s08_e19_c12_u213	Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y'know?
s08_e19_c12_u214	Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.
s08_e19_c12_u215	Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!
s08_e19_c13_u216	Wow! I can't believe they didn't put it in the part where you said you didn't watch soap operas.
s08_e19_c13_u217	Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
s08_e19_c13_u218	You slept with her didn't you?
s08_e19_c13_u219	Little bit, yeah.
s08_e19_c13_u220	Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
s08_e19_c13_u221	Oh yeah, that's just a little something for my huge gay fan base. (Winks at him.)
s08_e19_c13_u222	Did you just wink at me?
s08_e19_c13_u223	Hey, you're the one that loves the picture.
s08_e07_c01_u001	Hey.
s08_e07_c01_u002	Hey.
s08_e07_c01_u003	Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
s08_e07_c01_u004	Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
s08_e07_c01_u005	Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
s08_e07_c01_u006	No, it wasn't you.
s08_e07_c01_u007	Well then who?
s08_e07_c01_u008	I got a maid. Yay!
s08_e07_c01_u009	(shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then
s08_e07_c01_u010	Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control
s08_e07_c01_u011	Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
s08_e07_c01_u012	Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
s08_e07_c01_u013	Did she really say that?
s08_e07_c01_u014	Yes, I distinctly remember cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
s08_e07_c01_u015	Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.
s08_e07_c01_u016	What's the matter?
s08_e07_c01_u017	Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!
s08_e07_c02_u018	(looking around) Who's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
s08_e07_c02_u019	I think it's coming from your bag.
s08_e07_c02_u020	(checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?
s08_e07_c02_u021	Hi, it's Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula's fiancee.
s08_e07_c02_u022	Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?
s08_e07_c02_u023	Oh, I have a friend who's a cop and he got it for me.
s08_e07_c02_u024	Wow! What an incredible violation-and wonderful surprise.
s08_e07_c02_u025	Uh listen, I just-I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
s08_e07_c02_u026	Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!
s08_e07_c02_u027	Wow! What did he do?
s08_e07_c02_u028	Shhh! I'm talking.
s08_e07_c02_u029	Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who-eats lunch.
s08_e07_c02_u030	Are you asking me out? Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
s08_e07_c02_u031	Yeah uh-okay. I'm-I'm sorry. Bye.
s08_e07_c02_u032	No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
s08_e07_c02_u033	Uhh, I won't take no for an answer.
s08_e07_c02_u034	Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.
s08_e07_c02_u035	Great! But wh-wh-How do you know where I live?
s08_e07_c02_u036	I've got friends too. Okay, bye.
s08_e07_c02_u037	Bye.
s08_e07_c02_u038	Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch. (Exits.)
s08_e07_c02_u039	So apparently I'm available for lunch.
s08_e07_c02_u040	I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
s08_e07_c02_u041	You're moving?
s08_e07_c02_u042	Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, (in a baby's voice) "How you doin'?"
s08_e07_c02_u043	So does-does Joey know you're moving?
s08_e07_c02_u044	Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
s08_e07_c02_u045	That's not really porn.
s08_e07_c02_u046	Not so much.
s08_e07_c02_u047	Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
s08_e07_c02_u048	Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
s08_e07_c02_u049	Well I don't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel looks at him.) With your permission.
s08_e07_c02_u050	Yeah that would really be great.
s08_e07_c02_u051	Yeah.
s08_e07_c02_u052	Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
s08_e07_c02_u053	Yeah. No. No you're right.
s08_e07_c02_u054	Shall we?
s08_e07_c02_u055	Yeah.
s08_e07_c03_u056	Yes?
s08_e07_c03_u057	Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
s08_e07_c03_u058	And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
s08_e07_c03_u059	I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.
s08_e07_c03_u060	She didn't pass.
s08_e07_c03_u061	What?
s08_e07_c03_u062	My mother's still alive.
s08_e07_c03_u063	Oh, thank God!
s08_e07_c03_u064	It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she's a tough old bird.
s08_e07_c03_u065	Ahh.
s08_e07_c03_u066	Are you close with her?
s08_e07_c03_u067	Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)
s08_e07_c03_u068	You speak Dutch? (In Dutch) Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten. (Translation: I'm very honored to meet a friend of my mother.)
s08_e07_c03_u069	Y'know I would it's just painful.
s08_e07_c03_u070	So she's really not dead.
s08_e07_c03_u071	No, she's hanging in there.
s08_e07_c03_u072	Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
s08_e07_c04_u073	Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where'd you get it?
s08_e07_c04_u074	Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is-y'know what? We just met.
s08_e07_c04_u075	Okay. Uhh, I'm gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I'll clean behind the refrigerator.
s08_e07_c04_u076	(To Chandler) I love her.
s08_e07_c04_u077	I'll be back in a minute.
s08_e07_c04_u078	Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)
s08_e07_c04_u079	See? I told you.
s08_e07_c04_u080	She stole my jeans!
s08_e07_c04_u081	(pause) What?
s08_e07_c04_u082	I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
s08_e07_c04_u083	So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
s08_e07_c04_u084	Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
s08_e07_c04_u085	She must've been planning this for years!
s08_e07_c04_u086	I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
s08_e07_c04_u087	Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
s08_e07_c04_u088	I guess.
s08_e07_c04_u089	So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go-snooping around her crotch?
s08_e07_c04_u090	Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
s08_e07_c04_u091	Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
s08_e07_c04_u092	Yeah! (Laughs.)
s08_e07_c05_u093	Hi!
s08_e07_c05_u094	Come in, I'm so glad you're here.
s08_e07_c05_u095	Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
s08_e07_c05_u096	Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
s08_e07_c05_u097	Oh.
s08_e07_c05_u098	Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just-I got so angry just looking at her-(Looks at Phoebe)-face.
s08_e07_c05_u099	Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.
s08_e07_c05_u100	I'm sorry. I just-when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
s08_e07_c05_u101	Maybe this is too weird.
s08_e07_c05_u102	No wait! There's only a problem when I look at you. (Sits down on the couch.) Oh I got it! I got it. (Puts his hands to his eyes.)
s08_e07_c05_u103	No don't tear out your eyes!!
s08_e07_c05_u104	I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
s08_e07_c05_u105	Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?
s08_e07_c05_u106	Not really. You-you're blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You're Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe-If I-if I just don't look at you for a while. (Stands up and turns his back to her.) See? It-it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
s08_e07_c05_u107	Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and-(He kisses her)-second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they start to make out.)
s08_e07_c06_u108	Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates that phrase into Dutch.)
s08_e07_c06_u109	Yeah, we're done.
s08_e07_c06_u110	Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)
s08_e07_c06_u111	(entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
s08_e07_c06_u112	Really?!
s08_e07_c06_u113	(laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
s08_e07_c06_u114	Sweet!
s08_e07_c06_u115	All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.
s08_e07_c06_u116	Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
s08_e07_c06_u117	To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!
s08_e07_c06_u118	No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
s08_e07_c06_u119	Oh, you're switching apartments?
s08_e07_c06_u120	It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
s08_e07_c06_u121	But Rachel has an apartment.
s08_e07_c06_u122	Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.
s08_e07_c06_u123	She is?
s08_e07_c06_u124	Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?
s08_e07_c06_u125	I guess I didn't really think about it.
s08_e07_c06_u126	(finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!
s08_e07_c06_u127	Damnit!
s08_e07_c07_u128	Nice jeans!
s08_e07_c07_u129	Oh thanks! I like your top.
s08_e07_c07_u130	Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) You're not gettin' it.
s08_e07_c07_u131	What happened?!
s08_e07_c07_u132	Oh, I fell asleep.
s08_e07_c07_u133	I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
s08_e07_c07_u134	Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.
s08_e07_c07_u135	All right.
s08_e07_c07_u136	Hello.
s08_e07_c07_u137	What's going on?!
s08_e07_c07_u138	I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before, is this not okay?
s08_e07_c08_u139	Hey!
s08_e07_c08_u140	Hey!
s08_e07_c08_u141	How was the game?
s08_e07_c08_u142	Oh, okay. I-I ate way too much.
s08_e07_c08_u143	Oh.
s08_e07_c08_u144	Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
s08_e07_c08_u145	Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
s08_e07_c08_u146	I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
s08_e07_c08_u147	Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
s08_e07_c08_u148	No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. (Holds his hands about a foot apart.) Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.) Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby? (Mumbles that it's over in the corner.)
s08_e07_c08_u149	Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.
s08_e07_c08_u150	I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
s08_e07_c08_u151	Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
s08_e07_c08_u152	I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
s08_e07_c08_u153	I know.
s08_e07_c08_u154	Y'know I blame Ross for this.
s08_e07_c08_u155	I do too a little bit.
s08_e07_c08_u156	I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.
s08_e07_c09_u157	Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
s08_e07_c09_u158	Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.
s08_e07_c09_u159	No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.
s08_e07_c09_u160	Absolutely. (They kiss and Phoebe heads for the door.) I love the way you kiss.
s08_e07_c09_u161	Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see. (Exits.)
s08_e07_c10_u162	(entering) Hi!
s08_e07_c10_u163	Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
s08_e07_c10_u164	How come?
s08_e07_c10_u165	Because I put my head between her legs.
s08_e07_c10_u166	To see her pants?
s08_e07_c10_u167	They're my pants!
s08_e07_c10_u168	Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
s08_e07_c10_u169	No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
s08_e07_c10_u170	God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
s08_e07_c10_u171	Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) She's wearing my bra!
s08_e07_c10_u172	Oh dear God!
s08_e07_c10_u173	My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
s08_e07_c10_u174	And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
s08_e07_c10_u175	Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
s08_e07_c10_u176	Here's another plan-No!
s08_e07_c10_u177	I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!
s08_e07_c10_u178	Why?
s08_e07_c10_u179	Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
s08_e07_c10_u180	I fear a jury will see it the same way!
s08_e07_c10_u181	Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!
s08_e07_c10_u182	You see that?
s08_e07_c10_u183	Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a woman's breasts.)
s08_e07_c10_u184	All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
s08_e07_c10_u185	Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
s08_e07_c10_u186	You need new clothes.
s08_e07_c11_u187	Hi. How is she?
s08_e07_c11_u188	It's not looking good.
s08_e07_c11_u189	(happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)
s08_e07_c11_u190	That's so sweet. (Takes the flowers.) Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
s08_e07_c11_u191	Oh I don't know that it would.
s08_e07_c11_u192	Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
s08_e07_c11_u193	All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)
s08_e07_c12_u194	(entering) Hey!
s08_e07_c12_u195	Welcome back!
s08_e07_c12_u196	Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?
s08_e07_c12_u197	I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
s08_e07_c12_u198	Why?
s08_e07_c12_u199	Uh, the sex.
s08_e07_c12_u200	What sex?
s08_e07_c12_u201	Our sex.
s08_e07_c12_u202	We didn't have sex.
s08_e07_c12_u203	Well if I didn't have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like
s08_e07_c12_u204	(simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
s08_e07_c12_u205	(simultaneously as Phoebe) Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
s08_e07_c12_u206	You-you-you had sex with Ursula?!
s08_e07_c12_u207	Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
s08_e07_c12_u208	You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
s08_e07_c12_u209	Well I was just so excited to see you.
s08_e07_c12_u210	Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
s08_e07_c12_u211	No-no it's not! I don't want to lose you! It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you-Yeah it is too weird.
s08_e07_c12_u212	So I guess this is it.
s08_e07_c12_u213	Yeah. (They hug.) Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.
s08_e07_c12_u214	Yeah, so do you.
s08_e07_c13_u215	(noticing him) What are you doing?
s08_e07_c13_u216	I'm leaning. This is where I lean.
s08_e07_c13_u217	Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
s08_e07_c13_u218	Brenda a bee!
s08_e07_c13_u219	What?
s08_e07_c13_u220	Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
s08_e07_c13_u221	I think I know what's going on here.
s08_e07_c13_u222	You do?
s08_e07_c13_u223	Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it's wrong. You're married.
s08_e07_c13_u224	I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?
s08_e07_c14_u225	Hi!
s08_e07_c14_u226	(looking at Rachel's jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!
s08_e07_c14_u227	You gave them to me!
s08_e07_c14_u228	No I didn't!
s08_e07_c14_u229	All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
s08_e07_c14_u230	Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
s08_e07_c14_u231	What bra?
s08_e07_c14_u232	The pink one with the flowers?!
s08_e07_c14_u233	You mean the one that you're wearing? (Adjusts Monica's pink bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)
s08_e07_c14_u234	(entering) I quit! (Storms off.)
s08_e07_c14_u235	Sounds about right.
s08_e07_c15_u236	What is this?
s08_e07_c15_u237	Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh-Oh look! Here's a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
s08_e07_c15_u238	You're so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)
s08_e07_c15_u239	Ahhhhhhhhhhhh-. That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)
s08_e07_c15_u240	But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
s08_e07_c15_u241	I'm loud!
s08_e07_c15_u242	It's gonna be up all night!
s08_e07_c15_u243	I'm up all night!
s08_e07_c15_u244	It's gonna poop!
s08_e07_c15_u245	Hello!
s08_e07_c15_u246	What about all the women you want to bring home?
s08_e07_c15_u247	Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
s08_e07_c15_u248	Joey, are you sure?
s08_e07_c15_u249	Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really-really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
s08_e07_c15_u250	I want me to stay too.
s08_e07_c15_u251	Ohh!
s08_e07_c15_u252	Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
s08_e07_c15_u253	I know! I found it on the street.
s08_e07_c15_u254	Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.
s08_e07_c15_u255	Yeah.
s08_e07_c15_u256	Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
s08_e07_c15_u257	I don't know.
s08_e07_c15_u258	It's moving.
s08_e07_c15_u259	Ew.
s08_e07_c15_u260	It's still-(Screams)-It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
s08_e07_c15_u261	Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)
s08_e07_c16_u262	Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don't care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!
s08_e07_c16_u263	Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.
s08_e07_c16_u264	Isn't that great?
s08_e07_c16_u265	(stutters looking for words) Ezels!!
s08_e05_c01_u001	Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! (Phoebe enters) Hey Phoebe!
s08_e05_c01_u002	Hey!
s08_e05_c01_u003	Hey how was dinner?!
s08_e05_c01_u004	Dinner was good!
s08_e05_c01_u005	Okay!
s08_e05_c01_u006	I'm just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
s08_e05_c01_u007	Okay!
s08_e05_c01_u008	(To him) Oh, well hello there.
s08_e05_c01_u009	(To Monica) I didn't see this on the menu.
s08_e05_c01_u010	Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
s08_e05_c01_u011	Oh, so you're Monica's boss?
s08_e05_c01_u012	Actually she's my-my boss. Sous is French for under.
s08_e05_c01_u013	Oh! I sous stand.
s08_e05_c01_u014	Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?
s08_e05_c01_u015	Yeah.
s08_e05_c01_u016	Oh you-you made pesto?
s08_e05_c01_u017	Yes I did.
s08_e05_c01_u018	Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
s08_e05_c01_u019	I-I-I don't know, but I would say it's pretty good-o. (Phoebe laughs too hard.)
s08_e05_c01_u020	All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
s08_e05_c01_u021	I like your necklace.
s08_e05_c01_u022	I made it myself.
s08_e05_c01_u023	You are so talented.
s08_e05_c01_u024	Well, it's no pesto.
s08_e05_c01_u025	All right, all right! Let's just cut to the chase, okay? (To Phoebe) You're single. (To Tim) You're single. (To Phoebe) He gets off work at eleven. (To Tim) She'll be waiting for your call. (To Phoebe) I'll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! (Everyone in the kitchen stops.) I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
s08_e05_c02_u026	Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
s08_e05_c02_u027	You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
s08_e05_c02_u028	You're a joker Bing. (Walks away.)
s08_e05_c02_u029	What's funny about that?
s08_e05_c02_u030	(running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
s08_e05_c02_u031	Hey that's okay. So, where do you want to go?
s08_e05_c02_u032	Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
s08_e05_c02_u033	The Hard Rock Cafe?
s08_e05_c02_u034	Yeah!
s08_e05_c02_u035	Again?!
s08_e05_c02_u036	Yeah!!
s08_e05_c02_u037	I'm telling you, I like the food!
s08_e05_c02_u038	You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.
s08_e05_c02_u039	Hey Toby! Have a good night. (Walks by.)
s08_e05_c02_u040	Did that guy just call you Toby?
s08_e05_c02_u041	Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
s08_e05_c02_u042	Well, why don't you correct him?
s08_e05_c02_u043	Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
s08_e05_c02_u044	Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
s08_e05_c02_u045	No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)
s08_e05_c02_u046	(laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
s08_e05_c02_u047	Shh! It is a family name!
s08_e05_c02_u048	Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
s08_e05_c03_u049	Drake, I've discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.
s08_e05_c03_u050	What is it?
s08_e05_c03_u051	Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica's brain.
s08_e05_c03_u052	Is it serious?
s08_e05_c03_u053	Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.
s08_e05_c03_u054	Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that.
s08_e05_c03_u055	We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica's body, it was gone.
s08_e05_c03_u056	Cut! Very nice people!
s08_e05_c03_u057	(To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
s08_e05_c03_u058	Well don't-What happened to Jessica's body?!
s08_e05_c03_u059	I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!
s08_e05_c03_u060	You don't know do you?
s08_e05_c03_u061	No, couldn't care less.
s08_e05_c03_u062	Hey good scene man.
s08_e05_c03_u063	Hey you too!
s08_e05_c03_u064	Alright.
s08_e05_c03_u065	What? You weren't in it.
s08_e05_c03_u066	Oh! (Motions to Joey's co-star.)
s08_e05_c03_u067	Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
s08_e05_c03_u068	Yes?
s08_e05_c03_u069	This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
s08_e05_c03_u070	Hi.
s08_e05_c03_u071	Hey! How come I haven't seen you here before?
s08_e05_c03_u072	Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts stroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
s08_e05_c03_u073	(grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away from Kash.)
s08_e05_c03_u074	Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.
s08_e05_c03_u075	Bye.
s08_e05_c03_u076	Say hi to Wally.
s08_e05_c04_u077	Ooh Monica!
s08_e05_c04_u078	Hi!
s08_e05_c04_u079	Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him.
s08_e05_c04_u080	I-I have to fire him.
s08_e05_c04_u081	But why?!
s08_e05_c04_u082	Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
s08_e05_c04_u083	Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
s08_e05_c04_u084	Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
s08_e05_c04_u085	But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
s08_e05_c04_u086	(thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
s08_e05_c04_u087	That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
s08_e05_c04_u088	I paid to have this done.
s08_e05_c04_u089	Love it!
s08_e05_c05_u090	Hey!
s08_e05_c05_u091	Hi!
s08_e05_c05_u092	Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
s08_e05_c05_u093	I thought I was a complete idiot.
s08_e05_c05_u094	Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
s08_e05_c05_u095	Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
s08_e05_c05_u096	I said no.
s08_e05_c05_u097	What?!
s08_e05_c05_u098	What? I-I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
s08_e05_c05_u099	Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
s08_e05_c05_u100	I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
s08_e05_c05_u101	Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?
s08_e05_c05_u102	Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great
s08_e05_c05_u103	Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet em all!
s08_e05_c06_u104	Hey Bob.
s08_e05_c06_u105	Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?
s08_e05_c06_u106	If I see him, I'll ask.
s08_e05_c06_u107	(laughs) Toby!
s08_e05_c06_u108	Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
s08_e05_c06_u109	Yeah!
s08_e05_c06_u110	Oh then you know each other.
s08_e05_c06_u111	We're on a semi-first name basis.
s08_e05_c06_u112	What do you think of adding him to our team?
s08_e05_c06_u113	Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.
s08_e05_c06_u114	Really? They love him down on six.
s08_e05_c06_u115	But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.
s08_e05_c06_u116	Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
s08_e05_c06_u117	I think it's best sir.
s08_e05_c06_u118	But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high. (Holds his hand at shoulder level.)
s08_e05_c06_u119	Y'know what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.
s08_e05_c06_u120	(laughs) That's a good one. (Walks away.)
s08_e05_c06_u121	What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
s08_e05_c07_u122	Hey!
s08_e05_c07_u123	Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
s08_e05_c07_u124	But
s08_e05_c07_u125	No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
s08_e05_c07_u126	Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.
s08_e05_c07_u127	Why not?!
s08_e05_c07_u128	Because I'm dumping him today.
s08_e05_c07_u129	What?! You said he was sweet!
s08_e05_c07_u130	He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time. (Mimicking him) "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
s08_e05_c07_u131	Just don't pick up your phone.
s08_e05_c07_u132	Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
s08_e05_c07_u133	What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
s08_e05_c07_u134	You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.
s08_e05_c07_u135	Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
s08_e05_c07_u136	Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!
s08_e05_c07_u137	Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!
s08_e05_c07_u138	Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
s08_e05_c07_u139	What do you mean?
s08_e05_c07_u140	Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!
s08_e05_c07_u141	I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
s08_e05_c07_u142	All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)
s08_e05_c08_u143	Hey Toby, you got a sec?
s08_e05_c08_u144	Sure, what's up?
s08_e05_c08_u145	I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I'm not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?
s08_e05_c09_u146	Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"
s08_e05_c09_u147	(entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!
s08_e05_c09_u148	Hi!
s08_e05_c09_u149	Hey!
s08_e05_c09_u150	So, what do you want to do tonight? There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
s08_e05_c09_u151	No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
s08_e05_c09_u152	Rach? You wanna come?
s08_e05_c09_u153	Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
s08_e05_c09_u154	A date?
s08_e05_c09_u155	Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
s08_e05_c09_u156	Why no, it's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.
s08_e05_c09_u157	It's no Ukrainian film.
s08_e05_c09_u158	Yeah-Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)
s08_e05_c09_u159	A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?
s08_e05_c09_u160	I set her up with this actor on my show.
s08_e05_c09_u161	You set her up?!
s08_e05_c09_u162	No
s08_e05_c09_u163	Joey what-what were you thinking?!
s08_e05_c09_u164	Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!
s08_e05_c09_u165	Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?
s08_e05_c09_u166	Hey! I'm an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
s08_e05_c09_u167	A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
s08_e05_c09_u168	Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
s08_e05_c09_u169	Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!
s08_e05_c09_u170	Hey Joey.
s08_e05_c09_u171	Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
s08_e05_c09_u172	Hey.
s08_e05_c09_u173	Hi. I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
s08_e05_c09_u174	Yeah.
s08_e05_c09_u175	A bit of a daredevil are we?
s08_e05_c09_u176	(entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
s08_e05_c09_u177	Hey Rachel! You ready to go?
s08_e05_c09_u178	Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
s08_e05_c09_u179	Okay. Have a great time you guys.
s08_e05_c09_u180	Thank you.
s08_e05_c09_u181	Thank you.
s08_e05_c09_u182	Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the entire sentence.)
s08_e05_c10_u183	(walks behind Phoebe) Hi! (And startles her.)
s08_e05_c10_u184	Hi.
s08_e05_c10_u185	Oh, I'm so glad you called. I feel like it's always me calling you. So, what's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
s08_e05_c10_u186	It will be-in a minute. Listen, Tim you're a really great guy.
s08_e05_c10_u187	It's because I'm with you.
s08_e05_c10_u188	Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I-I
s08_e05_c10_u189	Whoops. Sorry. (Looking at it, like a newscaster) This just in. (Phoebe fake laughs.) Oh, it's 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away. (Starts to leave.)
s08_e05_c10_u190	Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.
s08_e05_c10_u191	Awww, I'll miss you too Pheebs. (Starts to leave) And I will be holding you, right here. (Holds his hands over his heart, blows a kiss to Phoebe who catches it, and then leaves and Phoebe throws the kiss back.)
s08_e05_c11_u192	So what movie do you want to see-And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
s08_e05_c11_u193	Books?
s08_e05_c11_u194	All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!
s08_e05_c11_u195	Well, I tell you what. Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.
s08_e05_c11_u196	And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
s08_e05_c11_u197	Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.
s08_e05_c11_u198	Dude! What is going on?!
s08_e05_c11_u199	I just-I have to find out how it went.
s08_e05_c11_u200	Why?
s08_e05_c11_u201	This guy could be my baby's stepfather!
s08_e05_c11_u202	They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
s08_e05_c11_u203	I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
s08_e05_c11_u204	Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
s08_e05_c11_u205	I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
s08_e05_c11_u206	What do you mean?
s08_e05_c11_u207	It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.
s08_e05_c11_u208	That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
s08_e05_c11_u209	No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
s08_e05_c11_u210	Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
s08_e05_c11_u211	It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smokin' body though.
s08_e05_c11_u212	Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
s08_e05_c11_u213	No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
s08_e05_c11_u214	I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.
s08_e05_c11_u215	No, it's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
s08_e05_c11_u216	That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
s08_e05_c11_u217	Yeah.
s08_e05_c11_u218	Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
s08_e05_c11_u219	(checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
s08_e05_c11_u220	No, I said fun!
s08_e05_c12_u221	Hey Toby!
s08_e05_c12_u222	Hey Bobby.
s08_e05_c12_u223	It's Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing's office is?
s08_e05_c12_u224	Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's (Points down the hall) right, right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
s08_e05_c12_u225	I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
s08_e05_c12_u226	Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
s08_e05_c12_u227	Toby don't.
s08_e05_c12_u228	Bob!
s08_e05_c12_u229	Toby! I'm not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
s08_e05_c12_u230	Well that puts me in a difficult position.
s08_e05_c13_u231	Hey.
s08_e05_c13_u232	I got your page, is everything okay?
s08_e05_c13_u233	Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
s08_e05_c13_u234	Oh it's great! It's great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
s08_e05_c13_u235	Oh my pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. (Phoebe enters.) Phoebe!
s08_e05_c13_u236	Monica!
s08_e05_c13_u237	(simultaneously) You're fired!
s08_e05_c13_u238	(simultaneously) I'm breaking up with you!
s08_e05_c13_u239	What?
s08_e05_c13_u240	I'm, I'm breaking up with you.
s08_e05_c13_u241	You're fired.
s08_e05_c13_u242	Why?
s08_e05_c13_u243	I'm sorry, I'm just-I'm-I'm just not ready for a relationship right now.
s08_e05_c13_u244	Yeah and-and I'm sorry too. But, well I just-I like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right.
s08_e05_c13_u245	Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
s08_e05_c13_u246	Wow! Umm, okay. Umm- (To Phoebe) I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, it's only because I think you're so amazing. (To Monica) And uh, I-I just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here because I-you're the most talented chef I've ever worked for. Anyway- (Starts to leave and Phoebe and Monica trade looks.)
s08_e05_c13_u247	Tim wait!
s08_e05_c13_u248	Yeah?
s08_e05_c13_u249	Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
s08_e05_c13_u250	Really?
s08_e05_c13_u251	Yeah.
s08_e05_c13_u252	Thank you so much! Cause I-I know I can do better!
s08_e05_c13_u253	Okay.
s08_e05_c13_u254	And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves, which disgusts Monica.)
s08_e05_c14_u255	Hello.
s08_e05_c14_u256	Hi!
s08_e05_c14_u257	Well, how was the date?
s08_e05_c14_u258	Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
s08_e05_c14_u259	Uh-huh. What happened?
s08_e05_c14_u260	I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
s08_e05_c14_u261	Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?
s08_e05_c14_u262	Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.
s08_e05_c14_u263	Oh?
s08_e05_c14_u264	He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
s08_e05_c14_u265	He sounds swell.
s08_e05_c14_u266	Doesn't he?
s08_e05_c14_u267	Hey, wanna-wanna a little cheering up?
s08_e05_c14_u268	Yes.
s08_e05_c14_u269	Sit down.
s08_e05_c14_u270	Okay.
s08_e05_c14_u271	Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
s08_e05_c14_u272	(thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?
s08_e05_c14_u273	Yeah-ha!
s08_e05_c14_u274	Oh my God. (Laughs)
s08_e05_c14_u275	I'm sorry about your date.
s08_e05_c14_u276	Oh it's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard.
s08_e05_c14_u277	Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
s08_e05_c14_u278	Thanks sweetie.
s08_e05_c14_u279	You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
s08_e05_c14_u280	Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
s08_e05_c14_u281	Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
s08_e05_c14_u282	Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
s08_e05_c14_u283	Right. Good night.
s08_e05_c14_u284	Good night.
s08_e05_c15_u285	Ross?
s08_e05_c15_u286	Yeah?
s08_e05_c15_u287	Hey it's Mona! From the wedding.
s08_e05_c15_u288	Oh hi!
s08_e05_c15_u289	Hi!
s08_e05_c15_u290	Wow! Uh-how are you?
s08_e05_c15_u291	I'm good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
s08_e05_c15_u292	Oh that's right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
s08_e05_c15_u293	(laughs then stops) Oh you're serious. Sure!
s08_e05_c15_u294	Great! Well umm
s08_e05_c15_u295	I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
s08_e05_c15_u296	Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
s08_e05_c15_u297	Okay.
s08_e05_c16_u298	(entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you doing?!
s08_e05_c16_u299	I just found out this is Chandler's office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
s02_e02_c01_u001	(entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)
s02_e02_c01_u002	Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
s02_e02_c01_u003	Oh, is he hungry already?
s02_e02_c01_u004	I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)
s02_e02_c01_u005	You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)
s02_e02_c01_u006	(joins him) I gotta get one, too.
s02_e02_c01_u007	(following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?
s02_e02_c01_u008	We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
s02_e02_c01_u009	Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
s02_e02_c01_u010	Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
s02_e02_c01_u011	This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
s02_e02_c01_u012	Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
s02_e02_c01_u013	Sure.
s02_e02_c01_u014	Uh, does it hurt?
s02_e02_c01_u015	It did at first, but not anymore.
s02_e02_c01_u016	Chandler?
s02_e02_c01_u017	So, uh, how often can you do it?
s02_e02_c01_u018	As much as he needs.
s02_e02_c01_u019	Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
s02_e02_c02_u020	Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
s02_e02_c02_u021	Yeah, I forget which ones.
s02_e02_c02_u022	Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
s02_e02_c02_u023	No thanks.
s02_e02_c02_u024	(To Rachel) Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go. (Ties it back up for her)
s02_e02_c02_u025	(to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch.
s02_e02_c02_u026	Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
s02_e02_c02_u027	I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
s02_e02_c02_u028	Ok, um, I'll go with you.
s02_e02_c02_u029	Great.
s02_e02_c02_u030	(enters) Hi, honey.
s02_e02_c02_u031	Hey, sweetums.
s02_e02_c02_u032	Hello to the rest.
s02_e02_c02_u033	Hi!
s02_e02_c02_u034	Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
s02_e02_c02_u035	It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
s02_e02_c02_u036	Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
s02_e02_c02_u037	But I'm...
s02_e02_c02_u038	Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
s02_e02_c02_u039	(to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
s02_e02_c02_u040	Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
s02_e02_c02_u041	It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
s02_e02_c02_u042	You're welcome.
s02_e02_c02_u043	Woof, woof.
s02_e02_c03_u044	(A guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (An attractive woman walks by.) Hey Annabelle.
s02_e02_c03_u045	Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
s02_e02_c03_u046	Who?
s02_e02_c03_u047	Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
s02_e02_c03_u048	What's he doin' in my section?
s02_e02_c03_u049	I guess he doesn't know.
s02_e02_c03_u050	Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? (To the Hombre Man) Hey, how ya doin'?
s02_e02_c03_u051	Mornin'.
s02_e02_c03_u052	Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
s02_e02_c03_u053	Your territory, huh?
s02_e02_c03_u054	Yeah. Bijan for men?
s02_e02_c03_u055	Hombre?
s02_e02_c03_u056	(To Joey) You were saying?
s02_e02_c04_u057	Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
s02_e02_c04_u058	What?
s02_e02_c04_u059	We were shopping, and we had lunch.
s02_e02_c04_u060	Oh, all right. What did I have?
s02_e02_c04_u061	You had a salad.
s02_e02_c04_u062	Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
s02_e02_c04_u063	(entering) Hey, guys, what's up.
s02_e02_c04_u064	I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
s02_e02_c04_u065	Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
s02_e02_c04_u066	Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
s02_e02_c04_u067	You went shopping for fur?
s02_e02_c04_u068	Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs.
s02_e02_c04_u069	You bought boobs?
s02_e02_c04_u070	(Monica is yanking on her bra strap) Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
s02_e02_c05_u071	(to a guy) Bijan for men? (to a guy) Bijan for men? (To a woman) Bijan for... (Sees it's a woman and stops.) (To Annabelle who walks up.) Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
s02_e02_c05_u072	Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
s02_e02_c05_u073	(entering) Ready, Annabelle?
s02_e02_c05_u074	You bet. (to Joey) Maybe some other time?
s02_e02_c05_u075	(To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, and Joey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?!
s02_e02_c06_u076	Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
s02_e02_c06_u077	Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
s02_e02_c06_u078	Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. (Ross looks at her.) Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
s02_e02_c06_u079	Oh, this is so cute.
s02_e02_c06_u080	Oh, I got that for him.
s02_e02_c06_u081	My mommies love me. That's clever.
s02_e02_c06_u082	Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-(Sees Rachel is watching)-Hi, Jew! (Walks into the kitchen.) (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens.) Uh huh? (Listens) Ok. (Listens) Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. (Hangs up.)
s02_e02_c06_u083	Did you just say Hi, Jew?
s02_e02_c06_u084	Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
s02_e02_c07_u085	Ben, dinner!
s02_e02_c07_u086	Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
s02_e02_c07_u087	Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her wrist and tastes it.)
s02_e02_c07_u088	What did you just do?
s02_e02_c07_u089	I licked my arm, what?
s02_e02_c07_u090	It's breast milk.
s02_e02_c07_u091	So?
s02_e02_c07_u092	Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
s02_e02_c07_u093	What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)
s02_e02_c07_u094	What did you just do?
s02_e02_c07_u095	Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
s02_e02_c07_u096	You won't even taste it?
s02_e02_c07_u097	No!
s02_e02_c07_u098	Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
s02_e02_c07_u099	Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
s02_e02_c08_u100	Hey, where is everybody?
s02_e02_c08_u101	They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
s02_e02_c08_u102	Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
s02_e02_c08_u103	Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in the pocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and notices she also grabbed a receipt.)
s02_e02_c08_u104	You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
s02_e02_c08_u105	And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
s02_e02_c08_u106	That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
s02_e02_c08_u107	Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
s02_e02_c08_u108	Judy.
s02_e02_c08_u109	Who?
s02_e02_c08_u110	Julie.
s02_e02_c08_u111	What?!
s02_e02_c08_u112	Jody!
s02_e02_c08_u113	You were with Julie?
s02_e02_c08_u114	Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
s02_e02_c08_u115	Oh. Oh my God.
s02_e02_c08_u116	Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
s02_e02_c08_u117	Yeah, right. Sure!
s02_e02_c08_u118	Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
s02_e02_c08_u119	Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)
s02_e02_c08_u120	That is not true!
s02_e02_c08_u121	Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
s02_e02_c08_u122	Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
s02_e02_c08_u123	Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? (Monica looks away.) Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now. (Exits.)
s02_e02_c09_u124	(on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve.
s02_e02_c09_u125	How did we do?
s02_e02_c09_u126	Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
s02_e02_c09_u127	I did not freak out.
s02_e02_c09_u128	Why'd you freak out?
s02_e02_c09_u129	Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
s02_e02_c09_u130	My breast milk is gross?
s02_e02_c09_u131	This should be fun.
s02_e02_c09_u132	No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
s02_e02_c09_u133	Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
s02_e02_c09_u134	Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. (Holding out a bottle.)
s02_e02_c09_u135	(jumping away) That would be no.
s02_e02_c09_u136	Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
s02_e02_c09_u137	Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
s02_e02_c09_u138	Cantaloupe juice.
s02_e02_c09_u139	Exactly.
s02_e02_c09_u140	(staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
s02_e02_c09_u141	Uh huh.
s02_e02_c09_u142	Oh, you've tasted it.
s02_e02_c09_u143	You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
s02_e02_c09_u144	(he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it off.)
s02_e02_c10_u145	Howdy.
s02_e02_c10_u146	(sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
s02_e02_c10_u147	Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
s02_e02_c10_u148	Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
s02_e02_c10_u149	(slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
s02_e02_c10_u150	I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
s02_e02_c10_u151	(pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
s02_e02_c10_u152	Yeah I guess you're right.
s02_e02_c10_u153	You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
s02_e02_c10_u154	I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)
s02_e02_c10_u155	All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
s02_e02_c11_u156	I don't know what else to say.
s02_e02_c11_u157	Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
s02_e02_c11_u158	I feel terrible, I really do.
s02_e02_c11_u159	Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
s02_e02_c11_u160	Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
s02_e02_c11_u161	Yes.
s02_e02_c11_u162	It's that terrible?
s02_e02_c11_u163	Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually (starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you.
s02_e02_c11_u164	Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, (starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
s02_e02_c11_u165	I love you too. (They hug.)
s02_e02_c11_u166	You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes and sits down.)
s02_e02_c11_u167	Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
s02_e02_c11_u168	(crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that.
s02_e02_c11_u169	(crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)
s02_e02_c11_u170	Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)
s02_e02_c12_u171	Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'.
s02_e02_c12_u172	I heard ya.
s02_e02_c12_u173	All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
s02_e02_c12_u174	Ready.
s02_e02_c12_u175	Yeah, I'm ready.
s02_e02_c12_u176	You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
s02_e02_c12_u177	Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
s02_e02_c12_u178	I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
s02_e02_c12_u179	(seeing the end result) My god, what happened?
s02_e02_c12_u180	These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
s02_e02_c12_u181	Sure.
s02_e02_c13_u182	So.
s02_e02_c13_u183	So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
s02_e02_c13_u184	I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
s02_e02_c13_u185	Really? Me?
s02_e02_c13_u186	Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
s02_e02_c13_u187	Well, you're not totally paranoid.
s02_e02_c13_u188	Oy.
s02_e02_c13_u189	Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
s02_e02_c13_u190	Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
s02_e02_c13_u191	Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
s02_e02_c13_u192	I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
s02_e02_c13_u193	All right, Julie.
s07_e12_c01_u001	(looking up) Ross, when's this comet thing start?
s07_e12_c01_u002	Well, technically it seven billion years ago- (Well, technically you'd be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of New York.)
s07_e12_c01_u003	(groaning) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up a leave.)
s07_e12_c01_u004	Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don't streak across the sky, meteors do.) Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King.
s07_e12_c01_u005	Okay! Okay! (They start to leave again.)
s07_e12_c01_u006	(looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
s07_e12_c01_u007	(looking up with her) That's a plane!
s07_e12_c01_u008	Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too.
s07_e12_c01_u009	Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
s07_e12_c01_u010	No. No, you can't.
s07_e12_c01_u011	What?
s07_e12_c01_u012	Oh I don't-I don't know.
s07_e12_c01_u013	Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from the city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
s07_e12_c01_u014	(looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Y'know what else makes you wonder?
s07_e12_c01_u015	Huh?
s07_e12_c01_u016	Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.)
s07_e12_c02_u017	Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly. (She walks over to where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)
s07_e12_c02_u018	(with a quivering voice) No, I'm not!
s07_e12_c02_u019	Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
s07_e12_c02_u020	Because it's flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)
s07_e12_c02_u021	Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
s07_e12_c02_u022	Oh! I won't say, no' to a movie!
s07_e12_c02_u023	Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
s07_e12_c02_u024	Shh! Get me out of here.
s07_e12_c02_u025	Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)
s07_e12_c02_u026	(whispering) Ross!
s07_e12_c02_u027	What?
s07_e12_c02_u028	Come here, check this out!
s07_e12_c02_u029	What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey's standing.)
s07_e12_c02_u030	No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down to get a closer look.)
s07_e12_c02_u031	Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
s07_e12_c02_u032	(standing up) Y'know, there's two women dude.
s07_e12_c02_u033	Show me where?
s07_e12_c02_u034	Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
s07_e12_c02_u035	(noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
s07_e12_c02_u036	(annoyed) I don't know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.) (Pause) Yeah, I do.
s07_e12_c02_u037	Joey!
s07_e12_c02_u038	What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
s07_e12_c02_u039	It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.) Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
s07_e12_c02_u040	(covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the door.)
s07_e12_c03_u041	(whispering) Monica!
s07_e12_c03_u042	She's sleeping.
s07_e12_c03_u043	I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
s07_e12_c03_u044	Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
s07_e12_c03_u045	Sorry, I just-can't sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like-(Fake snores.)
s07_e12_c03_u046	It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
s07_e12_c03_u047	What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
s07_e12_c04_u048	(crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and finds that it's the smoke detector that's beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she yanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.) How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can
s07_e12_c04_u049	Don't interrupt me!!
s07_e12_c05_u050	Rachel!! Monica!!
s07_e12_c05_u051	Come on!
s07_e12_c05_u052	I can't believe this!!
s07_e12_c05_u053	All right well, y'know-I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
s07_e12_c05_u054	(standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
s07_e12_c05_u055	Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it out.)
s07_e12_c05_u056	(To Joey) I know, I wasn't finished. (Joey motions him to finish.) (Yelling at the street) But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
s07_e12_c06_u057	Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
s07_e12_c06_u058	With a wok? (Chandler's holding a wok.) I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
s07_e12_c06_u059	It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
s07_e12_c06_u060	Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
s07_e12_c06_u061	Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
s07_e12_c06_u062	Okay that does sound like fun.
s07_e12_c06_u063	Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
s07_e12_c06_u064	The second sister dies?!
s07_e12_c06_u065	(Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
s07_e12_c06_u066	The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
s07_e12_c06_u067	That's correct.
s07_e12_c07_u068	You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
s07_e12_c07_u069	Sure.
s07_e12_c07_u070	Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
s07_e12_c07_u071	If this is your idea of sexy talk? (Shakes his head that it's not working.)
s07_e12_c07_u072	No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
s07_e12_c07_u073	What contracts?
s07_e12_c07_u074	Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
s07_e12_c07_u075	Like what?
s07_e12_c07_u076	Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He starts laughing.) Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
s07_e12_c07_u077	Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
s07_e12_c07_u078	Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
s07_e12_c07_u079	I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
s07_e12_c07_u080	Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
s07_e12_c07_u081	No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
s07_e12_c07_u082	Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
s07_e12_c07_u083	You wanna go down to the office right now?
s07_e12_c07_u084	No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
s07_e12_c07_u085	Okay I understand. (Sits down.) I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
s07_e12_c07_u086	Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel suddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook this? (Her bra.) Nice work!
s07_e12_c08_u087	All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
s07_e12_c08_u088	Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there-you go up to the roof and you let me in.
s07_e12_c08_u089	Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
s07_e12_c08_u090	Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
s07_e12_c08_u091	What if I smack my head on the concrete?
s07_e12_c08_u092	Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
s07_e12_c08_u093	(looks at the ground and at Ross) I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
s07_e12_c08_u094	Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?
s07_e12_c08_u095	No.
s07_e12_c08_u096	Okay. Well, you be careful.
s07_e12_c08_u097	What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
s07_e12_c08_u098	Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
s07_e12_c08_u099	Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
s07_e12_c09_u100	Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. (She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do- (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has stopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke detector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
s07_e12_c10_u101	Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She sees that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)
s07_e12_c10_u102	(startled) What? What? What?
s07_e12_c10_u103	Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here. (Hands the mug of milk to him.)
s07_e12_c11_u104	Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
s07_e12_c11_u105	Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
s07_e12_c11_u106	It's my sister.
s07_e12_c11_u107	Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes into her office.)
s07_e12_c11_u108	So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
s07_e12_c11_u109	In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave Tag) that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
s07_e12_c12_u110	It's not here.
s07_e12_c12_u111	Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
s07_e12_c12_u112	How could I have left them in the copy room?
s07_e12_c12_u113	I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
s07_e12_c12_u114	Fine.
s07_e12_c12_u115	Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the phone.) I still don't get it.
s07_e12_c13_u116	Are you still awake?
s07_e12_c13_u117	Yeah! You?
s07_e12_c13_u118	You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesn't respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as we're both up
s07_e12_c13_u119	(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
s07_e12_c14_u120	Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
s07_e12_c14_u121	(looking in the window behind them) Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
s07_e12_c14_u122	Yeah? Really? No one's home?
s07_e12_c14_u123	I don't think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big, large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the landing.) When you get in there- (Joey nods his disapproval.)
s07_e12_c15_u124	Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the chute.) Noisy bitch!
s07_e12_c16_u125	What?! What are you doing?!
s07_e12_c16_u126	Do you know what just happened?
s07_e12_c16_u127	Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
s07_e12_c16_u128	No. We were in the middle of sex-and you fell asleep.
s07_e12_c16_u129	Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)
s07_e12_c16_u130	(turning the light back on) Monica?
s07_e12_c16_u131	What?!
s07_e12_c16_u132	I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
s07_e12_c16_u133	Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
s07_e12_c16_u134	Okay.
s07_e12_c16_u135	Give me the good stuff.
s07_e12_c16_u136	Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn't move as he gets out of bed and as he's heading for the door.) And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
s07_e12_c16_u137	Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
s07_e12_c17_u138	Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh- (She looks for a place to set it on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) -fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
s07_e12_c17_u139	Still no luck.
s07_e12_c17_u140	Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
s07_e12_c17_u141	Do you want me to check again?
s07_e12_c17_u142	Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no it's not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one and he opens it. She doesn't see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
s07_e12_c17_u143	Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
s07_e12_c17_u144	(thinks) Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks into her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)
s07_e12_c17_u145	(smirking) Any luck?
s07_e12_c17_u146	Can I see you in my office for a minute?
s07_e12_c17_u147	(entering) Yeah? (She holds up the folder) You found them!! (Rachel is not amused, because she's still going to try to blame him for her mistake like every good' boss.) Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
s07_e12_c17_u148	You put these on my desk!
s07_e12_c17_u149	I did not!
s07_e12_c17_u150	Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbert should have a line here.)
s07_e12_c17_u151	How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
s07_e12_c17_u152	(pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I am so hot for you right now.
s07_e12_c18_u153	Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
s07_e12_c18_u154	(scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
s07_e12_c18_u155	We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
s07_e12_c18_u156	That's not mine.
s07_e12_c18_u157	Yes it is.
s07_e12_c18_u158	How do you know?
s07_e12_c18_u159	The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
s07_e12_c18_u160	Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
s07_e12_c18_u161	Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
s07_e12_c18_u162	Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
s07_e12_c18_u163	There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
s07_e12_c18_u164	There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and she goes to shut it off.) There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! (She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.) Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh, God!
s07_e12_c19_u165	Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
s07_e12_c19_u166	Yeah!
s07_e12_c19_u167	Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
s07_e12_c19_u168	All right! Just hurry up!
s07_e12_c19_u169	Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
s07_e12_c19_u170	I think face to face.
s07_e12_c19_u171	I would say that.
s07_e12_c19_u172	Face to face, yeah!
s07_e12_c19_u173	Okay, here I go.
s07_e12_c19_u174	All right.
s07_e12_c19_u175	(grunting) Oh my- How much do you weigh Ross?!
s07_e12_c19_u176	I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
s07_e12_c19_u177	Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
s07_e12_c19_u178	So what do you want me to do?
s07_e12_c19_u179	Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
s07_e12_c19_u180	Hi.
s07_e12_c19_u181	Hi.
s07_e12_c19_u182	(looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
s07_e12_c19_u183	(angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
s07_e12_c19_u184	It's still looks pretty far!
s07_e12_c19_u185	It's not that far! Just drop!
s07_e12_c19_u186	Do not rush me!!
s07_e12_c19_u187	Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
s07_e12_c19_u188	Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
s07_e12_c20_u189	That really was some of your best work.
s07_e12_c20_u190	Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
s07_e12_c20_u191	I have to be up in seven minutes.
s07_e12_c20_u192	Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
s07_e12_c20_u193	Really?!
s07_e12_c20_u194	Do you wanna?
s07_e12_c20_u195	Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
s08_e02_c01_u001	Listen y'know what sir? For the last time, I don't care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
s08_e02_c01_u002	(entering) Hey!
s08_e02_c01_u003	Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?
s08_e02_c01_u004	No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
s08_e02_c01_u005	(to the front desk clerk) Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
s08_e02_c01_u006	(depressed) That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!
s08_e02_c01_u007	And I'm the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
s08_e02_c01_u008	Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)
s08_e02_c01_u009	We got the honeymoon.
s08_e02_c01_u010	That's not til Thursday.
s08_e02_c01_u011	The wedding pictures?
s08_e02_c01_u012	They won't be ready for weeks.
s08_e02_c01_u013	Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
s08_e02_c01_u014	That's true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!
s08_e02_c01_u015	I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
s08_e02_c01_u016	Okay.
s08_e02_c01_u017	What? What did you take a picture of?
s08_e02_c01_u018	Nothing! It was something.
s08_e02_c01_u019	Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
s08_e02_c01_u020	Are you joking? Check out is not til noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.
s08_e02_c01_u021	Oh.
s08_e02_c01_u022	Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
s08_e02_c01_u023	Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y'know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.
s08_e02_c01_u024	Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. You're 32! (Exits)
s08_e02_c01_u025	(To Monica) Here's a copy of your bill.
s08_e02_c01_u026	Oh thanks. (Reading the bill) Champagne, strawberries-Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
s08_e02_c01_u027	Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?
s08_e02_c02_u028	Hi.
s08_e02_c02_u029	Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
s08_e02_c02_u030	Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
s08_e02_c02_u031	Yeah but you don't need-(Picks up something)-What is this?
s08_e02_c02_u032	Thread!
s08_e02_c02_u033	Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
s08_e02_c02_u034	What disposable cameras?
s08_e02_c02_u035	The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
s08_e02_c02_u036	No you didn't.
s08_e02_c02_u037	Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said
s08_e02_c02_u038	Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.
s08_e02_c02_u039	So you don't have the cameras?!
s08_e02_c02_u040	No. Sorry man.
s08_e02_c02_u041	So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
s08_e02_c02_u042	Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them.
s08_e02_c02_u043	Great.
s08_e02_c02_u044	In-in three minutes.
s08_e02_c03_u045	Hey!
s08_e02_c03_u046	Hey!
s08_e02_c03_u047	Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
s08_e02_c03_u048	No! (Pause) But, they're callin' out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
s08_e02_c03_u049	A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
s08_e02_c03_u050	A tiny salt shaker!!!
s08_e02_c03_u051	Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
s08_e02_c03_u052	Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
s08_e02_c03_u053	Oh yeah.
s08_e02_c03_u054	Good. Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
s08_e02_c03_u055	Okay.
s08_e02_c03_u056	Whew. Although y'know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean- I guess y'know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
s08_e02_c03_u057	Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)
s08_e02_c03_u058	Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)
s08_e02_c03_u059	(entering) Hi.
s08_e02_c03_u060	Hey, how are you feelin'? Any morning sickness?
s08_e02_c03_u061	Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
s08_e02_c03_u062	No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
s08_e02_c03_u063	Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.
s08_e02_c03_u064	Don't worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, cause I'm going to tell the father today.
s08_e02_c03_u065	Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
s08_e02_c03_u066	Ew! No!
s08_e02_c03_u067	What?! I think he's cute.
s08_e02_c03_u068	Well then you have his baby.
s08_e02_c03_u069	Believe me I'm trying.
s08_e02_c03_u070	Wow. Y'know it is so weird. I mean, you're gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
s08_e02_c03_u071	Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
s08_e02_c03_u072	Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
s08_e02_c03_u073	Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a clue! He's just walking down the street thinking, I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!' then bam! He's a father and everything's different.
s08_e02_c03_u074	Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
s08_e02_c03_u075	Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he's walking around thinking, Do I want to be a dad?' and then bam!
s08_e02_c03_u076	What was that bam?
s08_e02_c03_u077	I don't. He got-he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
s08_e02_c03_u078	(entering) Hey!
s08_e02_c03_u079	Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
s08_e02_c03_u080	(warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
s08_e02_c03_u081	Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!
s08_e02_c03_u082	Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?
s08_e02_c03_u083	Oh yeah. That's me.
s08_e02_c03_u084	Oh my God Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
s08_e02_c03_u085	Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I'm gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)
s08_e02_c03_u086	Whoa, wait a minute. Who's the father?
s08_e02_c03_u087	You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like she's pregnant.)
s08_e02_c03_u088	Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
s08_e02_c03_u089	David Lynn.
s08_e02_c03_u090	David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)
s08_e02_c03_u091	Who's David Lynn?
s08_e02_c03_u092	Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
s08_e02_c04_u093	Chandler?
s08_e02_c04_u094	Hey! Did you find the cameras?
s08_e02_c04_u095	No. Did you?
s08_e02_c04_u096	Yes! And that's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
s08_e02_c04_u097	Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them.
s08_e02_c04_u098	Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed.
s08_e02_c04_u099	Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
s08_e02_c04_u100	All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!
s08_e02_c04_u101	I'm sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
s08_e02_c04_u102	Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
s08_e02_c04_u103	No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
s08_e02_c04_u104	Are you serious?
s08_e02_c04_u105	I'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
s08_e02_c04_u106	Marriage advice? Really?!
s08_e02_c04_u107	I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?
s08_e02_c04_u108	I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers.
s08_e02_c04_u109	What about the chairs?
s08_e02_c04_u110	She picked those out too.
s08_e02_c04_u111	How about the place settings?
s08_e02_c04_u112	That was her.
s08_e02_c04_u113	What did you do?
s08_e02_c04_u114	I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
s08_e02_c04_u115	Hmm. (They head off to the gift shop.)
s08_e02_c05_u116	Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?
s08_e02_c05_u117	Not yet.
s08_e02_c05_u118	Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it Gunther?
s08_e02_c05_u119	No! Phoebe, it's not Gunther.
s08_e02_c05_u120	Thank God, cause that hair on a baby
s08_e02_c05_u121	Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
s08_e02_c05_u122	Why not?
s08_e02_c05_u123	I don't know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, I'm gonna tell the father today' and then bam!
s08_e02_c05_u124	Bus?
s08_e02_c05_u125	No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
s08_e02_c05_u126	Well-well but it is huge.
s08_e02_c05_u127	I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn't even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
s08_e02_c05_u128	You're thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of-See?
s08_e02_c06_u129	(entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
s08_e02_c06_u130	No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
s08_e02_c06_u131	Okay.
s08_e02_c06_u132	Give me one more.
s08_e02_c06_u133	Okay. (Hands her one.)
s08_e02_c06_u134	(entering) Hey.
s08_e02_c06_u135	Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.
s08_e02_c06_u136	All right. (She sits down like she's pregnant again.)
s08_e02_c06_u137	Umm, now uh- It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so- (He goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
s08_e02_c06_u138	Oh my God! Joey!
s08_e02_c06_u139	Hell yeah! I'll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)
s08_e02_c06_u140	You can't marry him!
s08_e02_c06_u141	Hey lady, your day's over! It's my turn!
s08_e02_c06_u142	Phoebe!
s08_e02_c06_u143	Why?! Why can't she marry me?!
s08_e02_c06_u144	I can and I will! (Kisses him.)
s08_e02_c06_u145	She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
s08_e02_c06_u146	Oh my God.
s08_e02_c06_u147	Hey!
s08_e02_c06_u148	Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
s08_e02_c06_u149	It's Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths I love you' to him.)
s08_e02_c06_u150	(smiles then stops) Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Who's the father?
s08_e02_c06_u151	We don't know.
s08_e02_c06_u152	Ohh- I wonder if that dude.
s08_e02_c06_u153	There's a dude?
s08_e02_c06_u154	Yeah.
s08_e02_c06_u155	Who? Who is it?
s08_e02_c06_u156	About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but- (He walks out and closes the door.)
s08_e02_c06_u157	Was that story over?
s08_e02_c06_u158	The guy left this.
s08_e02_c06_u159	(gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is- (She walks into Monica and Chandler's.)
s08_e02_c06_u160	People have got to finish their stories!
s08_e02_c07_u161	(to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
s08_e02_c07_u162	Oh! Of course. (Ross and Chandler pose and she takes the picture.)
s08_e02_c07_u163	Uh, would you take one of us?
s08_e02_c07_u164	Uhh- Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!
s08_e02_c07_u165	It didn't click.
s08_e02_c07_u166	I heard it. I heard it.
s08_e02_c07_u167	But there was no flash.
s08_e02_c07_u168	Why won't you take our picture?
s08_e02_c07_u169	Oh yeah. I'll take, I'll take your picture. (He takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)
s08_e02_c07_u170	Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
s08_e02_c07_u171	Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
s08_e02_c08_u172	Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
s08_e02_c08_u173	What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
s08_e02_c08_u174	I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
s08_e02_c08_u175	Oh God- Oh, he's in there right now?
s08_e02_c08_u176	Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
s08_e02_c08_u177	Uh, let's rip!
s08_e02_c08_u178	Really? Are you sure?
s08_e02_c08_u179	Oh Phoebe!
s08_e02_c08_u180	Okay, sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)
s08_e02_c08_u181	Hey Rach.
s08_e02_c09_u182	Why don't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
s08_e02_c09_u183	Okay. Okay!
s08_e02_c09_u184	Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
s08_e02_c09_u185	(rushing up) That's my car!
s08_e02_c09_u186	A '95 LeSabre?!
s08_e02_c09_u187	Yes!
s08_e02_c09_u188	A green LeSabre?
s08_e02_c09_u189	Yes!
s08_e02_c09_u190	I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
s08_e02_c09_u191	Yes! Green-blue!
s08_e02_c09_u192	Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)
s08_e02_c09_u193	Okay, you ready for the last picture?
s08_e02_c09_u194	Yeah.
s08_e02_c09_u195	Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.) Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)
s08_e02_c10_u196	So, what's this about?
s08_e02_c10_u197	Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
s08_e02_c10_u198	No. (Unzips his coat.) This is my red sweater.
s08_e02_c10_u199	Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or-poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)
s08_e02_c10_u200	What's going on Rach?
s08_e02_c10_u201	Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
s08_e02_c10_u202	Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together.
s08_e02_c10_u203	Oh, it's just not the right time.
s08_e02_c10_u204	It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)
s08_e02_c10_u205	Okay.
s08_e02_c10_u206	I'm ready for more.
s08_e02_c10_u207	Tag
s08_e02_c10_u208	Come on Rach, let's give it another try.
s08_e02_c10_u209	I'm having a baby.
s08_e02_c10_u210	Oh. (He drops her hand.)
s08_e02_c10_u211	You can go.
s08_e02_c10_u212	Thank you. (Gets up and hurries out.)
s08_e02_c11_u213	(throwing up the last present) I don't know how any of these got opened?!
s08_e02_c11_u214	(entering) You opened them all?
s08_e02_c11_u215	I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
s08_e02_c11_u216	Oh hey! You got my parent's gift! (Holds it up.)
s08_e02_c11_u217	Yeah. What is that?
s08_e02_c11_u218	Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
s08_e02_c11_u219	Hey! How'd it go?
s08_e02_c11_u220	Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
s08_e02_c11_u221	Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
s08_e02_c11_u222	I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)
s08_e02_c11_u223	Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!
s08_e02_c11_u224	So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
s08_e02_c11_u225	No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
s08_e02_c11_u226	Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
s08_e02_c11_u227	I'm not?
s08_e02_c11_u228	Listen I uh- (He takes her hand.) It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y'know? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?
s08_e02_c11_u229	What?
s08_e02_c11_u230	What?!
s08_e02_c11_u231	What?!!
s08_e02_c11_u232	Pheebs, give me the ring back!
s08_e02_c11_u233	No!!
s08_e02_c11_u234	No! Joey, oh you're so sweet. You're so-so sweet, honey. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband.
s08_e02_c11_u235	(heartbroken) I understand.
s08_e02_c11_u236	Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)
s08_e02_c11_u237	I can't say that didn't hurt. But I'll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
s08_e02_c11_u238	Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered
s08_e02_c11_u239	Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
s08_e02_c11_u240	There you go!
s08_e02_c11_u241	We're back!
s08_e02_c11_u242	Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! (She drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Let's stay in the kitchen!
s08_e02_c11_u243	It's picture time.
s08_e02_c11_u244	Now you are going to love these.
s08_e02_c11_u245	(showing her the pictures) Here's a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And that's me. (Another one.) And that's me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
s08_e02_c11_u246	Wow! That is a great picture!
s08_e02_c11_u247	Eh?
s08_e02_c11_u248	Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)
s08_e02_c11_u249	Huh, didn't see that coming.
s08_e02_c11_u250	Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with-with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need-(Rips the picture)-There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
s08_e02_c11_u251	That would be a good idea.
s08_e02_c11_u252	Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
s08_e02_c11_u253	You kissed another woman!
s08_e02_c11_u254	Call it even?!
s08_e02_c11_u255	Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)
s08_e02_c11_u256	Well, I'm gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.
s08_e02_c11_u257	Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?
s08_e02_c11_u258	No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! I've been looking for this for like a month!
s08_e02_c11_u259	(slow on the uptake) Oh my God!
s08_e02_c12_u260	Hey! How you doing?
s08_e02_c12_u261	Good! Good, long time no see.
s08_e02_c12_u262	Yeah.
s08_e02_c12_u263	Like your sweater.
s08_e02_c12_u264	Oh hey, right back at ya.
s08_e02_c12_u265	Oh, it's crazy about Rachel huh?
s08_e02_c12_u266	Yeah. She-Well, she's one crazy lady?
s08_e02_c12_u267	So whose is it?
s08_e02_c12_u268	(shows Tag his sweater tag) Umm, I don't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
s08_e02_c12_u269	Okay.
s08_e02_c12_u270	He is so weird.
s06_e04_c01_u001	So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
s06_e04_c01_u002	This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)
s06_e04_c01_u003	And?
s06_e04_c01_u004	And it's a magnet!
s06_e04_c01_u005	Look at that!
s06_e04_c01_u006	How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me (Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.
s06_e04_c01_u007	What?!
s06_e04_c01_u008	(in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!
s06_e04_c01_u009	Ross, I know what you're thinking.
s06_e04_c01_u010	What?
s06_e04_c01_u011	That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad.
s06_e04_c01_u012	Oh-my-God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
s06_e04_c01_u013	What?!!
s06_e04_c01_u014	Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
s06_e04_c01_u015	No! (Ross's phone rings.)
s06_e04_c01_u016	(answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?
s06_e04_c01_u017	Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?
s06_e04_c01_u018	No-no, I bought those.
s06_e04_c01_u019	Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.
s06_e04_c01_u020	Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)
s06_e04_c01_u021	(under her breath) That you're a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a drawer.)
s06_e04_c01_u022	(on phone) No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
s06_e04_c01_u023	Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?
s06_e04_c01_u024	Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
s06_e04_c01_u025	Well, who wouldn't?!
s06_e04_c01_u026	I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
s06_e04_c01_u027	Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
s06_e04_c01_u028	And Mrs.?!
s06_e04_c01_u029	Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married.
s06_e04_c01_u030	What?!!
s06_e04_c01_u031	Just kidding!
s06_e04_c01_u032	Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.)
s06_e04_c01_u033	(To Ross) Saved your ass.
s06_e04_c02_u034	Hey!
s06_e04_c02_u035	Hi.
s06_e04_c02_u036	Hey!
s06_e04_c02_u037	Oh, what's the matter?
s06_e04_c02_u038	Well, you know that psychic I see?
s06_e04_c02_u039	Yeah?
s06_e04_c02_u040	Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that.
s06_e04_c02_u041	What?!
s06_e04_c02_u042	Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
s06_e04_c02_u043	Phoebe that's crazy!
s06_e04_c02_u044	I can't believe she would say that too you.
s06_e04_c02_u045	Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
s06_e04_c02_u046	I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
s06_e04_c02_u047	Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
s06_e04_c02_u048	No, cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! (So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and starts reading.)
s06_e04_c02_u049	(entering) Hey everyone!
s06_e04_c02_u050	Oh hi!
s06_e04_c02_u051	Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
s06_e04_c02_u052	Oh that'd be great. Sure!
s06_e04_c02_u053	(he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct-"
s06_e04_c02_u054	Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me.
s06_e04_c02_u055	(continuing) "-subcategories. The first of these subcategories is-"
s06_e04_c02_u056	(interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
s06_e04_c02_u057	No! Why?
s06_e04_c02_u058	Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it.
s06_e04_c02_u059	Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) "There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler) into-"
s06_e04_c02_u060	Why don't you open with a joke?
s06_e04_c02_u061	Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!
s06_e04_c02_u062	Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!
s06_e04_c02_u063	(gets up) Okay!
s06_e04_c02_u064	Ohh! We're kidding! Oh, we're kidding!
s06_e04_c02_u065	Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
s06_e04_c02_u066	Thank you!
s06_e04_c02_u067	Some uh, some visual aides.
s06_e04_c02_u068	Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
s06_e04_c02_u069	Please don't say naked chicks.
s06_e04_c02_u070	Why not?!
s06_e04_c02_u071	I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
s06_e04_c02_u072	That's the way I did it til I was 19.
s06_e04_c03_u073	Hey.
s06_e04_c03_u074	Hey! Any good mail?
s06_e04_c03_u075	Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.
s06_e04_c03_u076	Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda-.
s06_e04_c03_u077	(opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed."
s06_e04_c03_u078	Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
s06_e04_c03_u079	Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.
s06_e04_c03_u080	Let me see that!
s06_e04_c03_u081	All right.
s06_e04_c03_u082	(reads it) Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
s06_e04_c03_u083	I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.
s06_e04_c03_u084	All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent.
s06_e04_c03_u085	Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
s06_e04_c03_u086	(mocks him, in a whiney voice) -look both ways before you cross the street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)
s06_e04_c04_u087	Hey!
s06_e04_c04_u088	Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?
s06_e04_c04_u089	Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)
s06_e04_c04_u090	Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
s06_e04_c04_u091	I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
s06_e04_c04_u092	Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
s06_e04_c04_u093	Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can.
s06_e04_c04_u094	Monica!
s06_e04_c04_u095	Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)
s06_e04_c04_u096	Did-did you take these back?
s06_e04_c04_u097	No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
s06_e04_c04_u098	Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?
s06_e04_c04_u099	I loved them!
s06_e04_c04_u100	Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)
s06_e04_c04_u101	(entering) Hello!
s06_e04_c04_u102	Hey!
s06_e04_c04_u103	Hey!
s06_e04_c04_u104	How'd the lecture go?
s06_e04_c04_u105	It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
s06_e04_c04_u106	Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before.
s06_e04_c04_u107	I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
s06_e04_c04_u108	That you're not funny or sexy?
s06_e04_c04_u109	That's right!
s06_e04_c05_u110	(entering) Hey Estelle, listen
s06_e04_c05_u111	Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
s06_e04_c05_u112	What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
s06_e04_c05_u113	Really?!
s06_e04_c05_u114	Yeah!
s06_e04_c05_u115	Oh well, no harm, no foul.
s06_e04_c05_u116	Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
s06_e04_c05_u117	All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
s06_e04_c05_u118	Why?
s06_e04_c05_u119	Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
s06_e04_c05_u120	Bastard!
s06_e04_c06_u121	Hey!
s06_e04_c06_u122	(in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
s06_e04_c06_u123	That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
s06_e04_c06_u124	What?!
s06_e04_c06_u125	What's wrong with you?
s06_e04_c06_u126	Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious.
s06_e04_c06_u127	This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
s06_e04_c06_u128	No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.)
s06_e04_c06_u129	That's a hernia.
s06_e04_c06_u130	Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.) Damn you 15s!
s06_e04_c07_u131	Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
s06_e04_c07_u132	Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch.
s06_e04_c07_u133	Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.
s06_e04_c07_u134	(to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when-(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.
s06_e04_c08_u135	What the hell are you doing?!
s06_e04_c08_u136	Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
s06_e04_c08_u137	Yeah, and not a very good one.
s06_e04_c08_u138	Will you-will you please?
s06_e04_c08_u139	Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
s06_e04_c08_u140	Oh.
s06_e04_c08_u141	Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
s06_e04_c08_u142	(in his British accent) I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
s06_e04_c08_u143	(in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her R')
s06_e04_c08_u144	(in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?
s06_e04_c08_u145	(normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! (To an exiting student in accent.) Top O the morning to ya laddies!
s06_e04_c08_u146	Just please stop!
s06_e04_c08_u147	(in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
s06_e04_c09_u148	Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
s06_e04_c09_u149	Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing.
s06_e04_c09_u150	I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing-pushed back in.
s06_e04_c09_u151	Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
s06_e04_c09_u152	Hey!
s06_e04_c09_u153	Hey.
s06_e04_c09_u154	Hey!
s06_e04_c09_u155	What's going on?
s06_e04_c09_u156	Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!
s06_e04_c09_u157	Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on Married-With Children always used to do.) it doesn't hurt that bad.
s06_e04_c09_u158	Hey! Maybe you'll die!
s06_e04_c09_u159	Sure, now I'm scared.
s06_e04_c09_u160	No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
s06_e04_c09_u161	Yeah, but I don't wanna die!
s06_e04_c09_u162	No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
s06_e04_c10_u163	Gimme em!
s06_e04_c10_u164	No! They are mine!
s06_e04_c10_u165	You stole them from me!
s06_e04_c10_u166	You stole them from me!!
s06_e04_c10_u167	Gimme them!
s06_e04_c10_u168	You just wanna each take one?
s06_e04_c10_u169	Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
s06_e04_c10_u170	(entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
s06_e04_c10_u171	Well
s06_e04_c10_u172	Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America.
s06_e04_c10_u173	Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!
s06_e04_c10_u174	They're not listening too me?
s06_e04_c10_u175	Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
s06_e04_c10_u176	Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
s06_e04_c10_u177	I think you look fine.
s06_e04_c11_u178	Whenever you're ready.
s06_e04_c11_u179	(in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."
s06_e04_c11_u180	Hold it. I'm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less-intense?
s06_e04_c11_u181	Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. (He turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.) "Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"
s06_e04_c11_u182	Oh my God!!
s06_e04_c12_u183	So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today! (He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he won't be able to pick it up.)
s06_e04_c12_u184	That's where you pick up the bag.
s06_e04_c12_u185	Exactly.
s06_e04_c12_u186	No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
s06_e04_c12_u187	Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didn't get it, did I?
s06_e04_c12_u188	No.
s06_e04_c12_u189	Yeah, okay. (Leaves)
s06_e04_c13_u190	Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for (Groans) man.
s06_e04_c13_u191	You mean dying man?
s06_e04_c13_u192	Yes!
s06_e04_c14_u193	Okay, come on, do it one more time!
s06_e04_c14_u194	Really? Really?!
s06_e04_c14_u195	Yes!
s06_e04_c14_u196	Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent) "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)
s06_e04_c14_u197	(entering) Hey!
s06_e04_c14_u198	Hey!
s06_e04_c14_u199	Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!
s06_e04_c14_u200	Really?! How do you know?
s06_e04_c14_u201	Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
s06_e04_c14_u202	Oh, I'm sorry.
s06_e04_c14_u203	Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!
s06_e04_c15_u204	Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
s06_e04_c15_u205	(barely audible through the pain) Thank you.
s06_e04_c15_u206	But are you sure you can do this?
s06_e04_c15_u207	Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
s06_e04_c15_u208	Now, is that never talking about it again?!
s06_e04_c15_u209	(to the director) Hiya!
s06_e04_c15_u210	Hey Joey, we're ready for ya! (Joey stumbles over) Joey, this is Alex he's going to be playing your son.
s06_e04_c15_u211	Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. (Holds them both up.)
s06_e04_c15_u212	Okay. (to Alex) All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," that's your cue to cry. Got it? (Alex nods yes.) All right, let's do this.
s06_e04_c15_u213	(with that board thingy) Scene 5, take 1.
s06_e04_c15_u214	And Action!
s06_e04_c15_u215	"Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex just looks at him and the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) "Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex does nothing.) "Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"
s06_e04_c15_u216	Cut! Alex, remember you're supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?
s06_e04_c15_u217	Okay.
s06_e04_c15_u218	All right, from the top.
s06_e04_c15_u219	Scene 5, take 2.
s06_e04_c15_u220	Take 36 is up!
s06_e04_c15_u221	All right! Let's try this again! You ready Joe?
s06_e04_c15_u222	Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?
s06_e04_c15_u223	Uh sure.
s06_e04_c15_u224	Okay. (Starts screaming.)
s06_e04_c15_u225	Action!
s06_e04_c15_u226	(he stops screaming at action) "Take good care of your Momma son." (Again Alex does nothing.)
s06_e04_c15_u227	Cut!!!!!!!!!! (Joey starts screaming again.)
s06_e04_c15_u228	I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
s06_e04_c16_u229	(answering it) Hello?
s06_e04_c16_u230	(Ross's divorce lawyer.) Hello, is Ross there?
s06_e04_c16_u231	Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?
s06_e04_c16_u232	Yes, this Russell, Ross's divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
s06_e04_c16_u233	Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
s06_e04_c17_u234	(in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)
s06_e04_c17_u235	What's happening to your accent?
s06_e04_c17_u236	(British) Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? (Giggles.) (American.) All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
s06_e04_c17_u237	Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
s06_e04_c17_u238	(in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!
s06_e04_c18_u239	Have you really done this before?
s06_e04_c18_u240	Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
s06_e04_c18_u241	Hey!
s06_e04_c18_u242	Hey-hey-hey!
s06_e04_c18_u243	What are you doing?
s06_e04_c18_u244	We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
s06_e04_c18_u245	Oh, all right.
s07_e17_c01_u001	So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
s07_e17_c01_u002	Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)
s07_e17_c01_u003	So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
s07_e17_c01_u004	Since when are you into swing music?
s07_e17_c01_u005	Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
s07_e17_c01_u006	Chandler.
s07_e17_c01_u007	Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
s07_e17_c01_u008	I will.
s07_e17_c01_u009	Do you want me to call?
s07_e17_c01_u010	No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
s07_e17_c01_u011	What is your job?
s07_e17_c01_u012	Staying out of the way.
s07_e17_c01_u013	This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15? (Hands back the paper.)
s07_e17_c01_u014	There were only twelve.
s07_e17_c01_u015	Oh yeah, I added three.
s07_e17_c01_u016	What are peanut butter fingers?!
s07_e17_c01_u017	Oh yeah- (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter, scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)
s07_e17_c02_u018	(noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?
s07_e17_c02_u019	Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
s07_e17_c02_u020	Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.
s07_e17_c02_u021	(exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.) (Calmly) So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly waves.)
s07_e17_c02_u022	Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, cause if you are-I'd love to show you around sometime.
s07_e17_c02_u023	I-I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
s07_e17_c02_u024	Ah.
s07_e17_c02_u025	But-but this block is like a whole other world.
s07_e17_c02_u026	Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he's talking about.)
s07_e17_c02_u027	(To Ross) Smooth.
s07_e17_c02_u028	(To Chandler) Excuse me? (Chandler does the shy thing again.)
s07_e17_c02_u029	Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
s07_e17_c02_u030	Oh I'd like that.
s07_e17_c02_u031	Yeah?
s07_e17_c02_u032	Yeah.
s07_e17_c02_u033	Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box he's holding.)
s07_e17_c02_u034	After you.
s07_e17_c02_u035	Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When she's gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can't pick it up.)
s07_e17_c03_u036	(wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
s07_e17_c03_u037	Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
s07_e17_c03_u038	(To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!
s07_e17_c03_u039	This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!
s07_e17_c03_u040	Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby.
s07_e17_c03_u041	Have you found your dress yet?
s07_e17_c03_u042	Oh no, these dresses are all so amazing but there is no way I could afford one.
s07_e17_c03_u043	No, I can't afford this either. No. I-I-I'm, I'm just to figure out which one I want then I'm gonna get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
s07_e17_c03_u044	Oh, thanks for the tip.
s07_e17_c03_u045	Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
s07_e17_c03_u046	Oh I'm not, I just like to try these on.
s07_e17_c03_u047	I do the same thing.
s07_e17_c03_u048	I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
s07_e17_c03_u049	I'm just kidding too. (Laughs) I'm getting married in December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)
s07_e17_c03_u050	(To Monica) So when are you getting married?
s07_e17_c03_u051	Oh May 15th.
s07_e17_c03_u052	Oooh it's getting close!
s07_e17_c03_u053	Yeah!
s07_e17_c03_u054	So uh, who's your photographer?
s07_e17_c03_u055	Jeffery.
s07_e17_c03_u056	We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
s07_e17_c03_u057	The best man? Wow!
s07_e17_c03_u058	I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, who's your band?!
s07_e17_c03_u059	Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
s07_e17_c03_u060	Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
s07_e17_c03_u061	Ooh, is that spelled with a C' or a K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
s07_e17_c03_u062	Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
s07_e17_c03_u063	So, does this (The dress) come in another color or- (The store owner walks away.)
s07_e17_c04_u064	(checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?
s07_e17_c04_u065	I'm moving in.
s07_e17_c04_u066	Oh uh, can I give you a hand?
s07_e17_c04_u067	Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
s07_e17_c04_u068	Boyfriend?
s07_e17_c04_u069	No.
s07_e17_c04_u070	I'm Joey. (They shake hands.)
s07_e17_c04_u071	Kristen.
s07_e17_c04_u072	Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?
s07_e17_c04_u073	Kristen.
s07_e17_c04_u074	Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So
s07_e17_c04_u075	So uh, do you live around here?
s07_e17_c04_u076	Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
s07_e17_c04_u077	I'll remember that.
s07_e17_c04_u078	Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
s07_e17_c04_u079	Oh I, I have plans tonight.
s07_e17_c04_u080	Oh.
s07_e17_c04_u081	But how about tomorrow?
s07_e17_c04_u082	Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go? (The lamp he's holding.)
s07_e17_c04_u083	You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
s07_e17_c04_u084	Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, I'll grab this one. (He follows her upstairs.)
s07_e17_c05_u085	(To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.
s07_e17_c05_u086	All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! (Holds up a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.
s07_e17_c05_u087	Okay.
s07_e17_c05_u088	Got it.
s07_e17_c05_u089	All right.
s07_e17_c05_u090	Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
s07_e17_c05_u091	(To Rachel) Hey! Don't be a baby!
s07_e17_c05_u092	Well I
s07_e17_c05_u093	(coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
s07_e17_c05_u094	No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Don't crowd me! (Finds it) This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it's perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) I'm sorry, this one's taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!
s07_e17_c05_u095	Megan!
s07_e17_c05_u096	Monica!
s07_e17_c05_u097	You came?!
s07_e17_c05_u098	Yeah!
s07_e17_c05_u099	This is my dress!
s07_e17_c05_u100	No!
s07_e17_c05_u101	Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
s07_e17_c05_u102	And now you'll see me buying it.
s07_e17_c05_u103	What? You freak! You wouldn't even have known about this place if it wasn't for me!
s07_e17_c05_u104	Look, you don't want to fight me.
s07_e17_c05_u105	Maybe I do! I'm pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.)
s07_e17_c05_u106	(hearing the signal) I'm coming! I'm coming! (She takes off towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)
s07_e17_c05_u107	Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What are you doing? (Rachel doesn't stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won't stop so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
s07_e17_c05_u108	Did you find the dress?
s07_e17_c05_u109	No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
s07_e17_c05_u110	I-We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)
s07_e17_c05_u111	No! You gotta hold my hand!!
s07_e17_c05_u112	Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel's hand and drags her towards Monica.) Excuse me! Excuse me! (She's knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)
s07_e17_c05_u113	(handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!
s07_e17_c05_u114	(seeing who's trapped) Hey
s07_e17_c05_u115	NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)
s07_e17_c06_u116	So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
s07_e17_c06_u117	Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
s07_e17_c06_u118	Huh.
s07_e17_c06_u119	Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says- (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)
s07_e17_c06_u120	(entering) Hey Chandler!
s07_e17_c06_u121	Hey!
s07_e17_c06_u122	Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date.
s07_e17_c06_u123	Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!
s07_e17_c06_u124	Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
s07_e17_c06_u125	Really? Right across the street?
s07_e17_c06_u126	Yeah!
s07_e17_c06_u127	When'd you meet her?
s07_e17_c06_u128	Two days ago.
s07_e17_c06_u129	Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
s07_e17_c06_u130	Oh yeah?
s07_e17_c06_u131	(returning) Hey.
s07_e17_c06_u132	Hi! How'd it go?
s07_e17_c06_u133	Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
s07_e17_c06_u134	(sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
s07_e17_c06_u135	Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
s07_e17_c06_u136	Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!
s07_e17_c06_u137	So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
s07_e17_c06_u138	Bye! (Exits.)
s07_e17_c07_u139	Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
s07_e17_c07_u140	Obviously! So, how do we decide?
s07_e17_c07_u141	Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her
s07_e17_c07_u142	(not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
s07_e17_c07_u143	That's interesting, but check this out. I date her
s07_e17_c07_u144	Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
s07_e17_c07_u145	Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
s07_e17_c07_u146	Yeah well we should order some food then.
s07_e17_c07_u147	No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
s07_e17_c07_u148	(smiling) That sounds fair.
s07_e17_c07_u149	Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
s07_e17_c07_u150	Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
s07_e17_c07_u151	Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
s07_e17_c07_u152	All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
s07_e17_c07_u153	So let's decide on the spending limit
s07_e17_c07_u154	Yeah. Uh, (thinks)-a slice-(Thinks)-six dollars?
s07_e17_c07_u155	I was thinking more like a hundred.
s07_e17_c07_u156	Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
s07_e17_c08_u157	Oh
s07_e17_c08_u158	I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)
s07_e17_c08_u159	You're out of Diet Coke.
s07_e17_c08_u160	Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen here missy! (Listens) Wh-(She is hung up on.)
s07_e17_c08_u161	What?!
s07_e17_c08_u162	That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
s07_e17_c08_u163	(gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?
s07_e17_c08_u164	What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh-Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
s07_e17_c08_u165	Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
s07_e17_c08_u166	How?
s07_e17_c08_u167	You're out of toilet paper!
s07_e17_c09_u168	(entering) Hey!
s07_e17_c09_u169	Hey! What's up?
s07_e17_c09_u170	I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
s07_e17_c09_u171	Oh thanks!
s07_e17_c09_u172	Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
s07_e17_c09_u173	We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
s07_e17_c09_u174	Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
s07_e17_c09_u175	I am dressed.
s07_e17_c09_u176	Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
s07_e17_c09_u177	I have an oily T-zone!
s07_e17_c09_u178	Okay dude! (Finds a receit.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
s07_e17_c09_u179	That's right.
s07_e17_c09_u180	You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
s07_e17_c09_u181	Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
s07_e17_c09_u182	Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
s07_e17_c09_u183	Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
s07_e17_c09_u184	I don't know.
s07_e17_c09_u185	Why am I not surprised?
s07_e17_c09_u186	Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
s07_e17_c09_u187	I don't think you have much choice.
s07_e17_c09_u188	Well we'll see!
s07_e17_c09_u189	Bye-bye!
s07_e17_c09_u190	Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So just a light layer?
s07_e17_c09_u191	Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).
s07_e17_c10_u192	Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
s07_e17_c10_u193	Yeah, swing music is so out.
s07_e17_c10_u194	Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
s07_e17_c10_u195	(returning) What are you guys talking about?
s07_e17_c10_u196	Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
s07_e17_c10_u197	Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
s07_e17_c10_u198	But I love swing music!
s07_e17_c10_u199	Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
s07_e17_c10_u200	Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
s07_e17_c10_u201	Well, what is the other reason?
s07_e17_c10_u202	I don't want to say.
s07_e17_c10_u203	Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
s07_e17_c10_u204	Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was-the first time I knew that-you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
s07_e17_c10_u205	Oh crap!
s07_e17_c11_u206	So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
s07_e17_c11_u207	Oh great!
s07_e17_c11_u208	Yeah.
s07_e17_c11_u209	Is your back feeling better?
s07_e17_c11_u210	Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
s07_e17_c11_u211	(entering) Kristen?
s07_e17_c11_u212	Joey!
s07_e17_c11_u213	Hi!
s07_e17_c11_u214	Hi! What are you doing here?
s07_e17_c11_u215	Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I
s07_e17_c11_u216	Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
s07_e17_c11_u217	Hi!
s07_e17_c11_u218	Hi. (They shake hands.) It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
s07_e17_c11_u219	Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
s07_e17_c11_u220	Yeah. So
s07_e17_c11_u221	Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)
s07_e17_c11_u222	So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
s07_e17_c11_u223	Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
s07_e17_c11_u224	That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
s07_e17_c11_u225	A woman in a man's body.
s07_e17_c11_u226	Much better.
s07_e17_c11_u227	So y'know Ross it's funny cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
s07_e17_c11_u228	Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
s07_e17_c11_u229	Yeah, little Eric.
s07_e17_c11_u230	That's right! Wait no, Ben.
s07_e17_c11_u231	So you've just married the one time then?
s07_e17_c11_u232	Well umm
s07_e17_c11_u233	You've been married twice?
s07_e17_c11_u234	Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
s07_e17_c11_u235	You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
s07_e17_c11_u236	(laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
s07_e17_c11_u237	Do you two know each other?
s07_e17_c11_u238	No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
s07_e17_c11_u239	Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
s07_e17_c11_u240	Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
s07_e17_c11_u241	Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
s07_e17_c11_u242	Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
s07_e17_c11_u243	Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
s07_e17_c11_u244	Monkey lover!
s07_e17_c11_u245	When do you think we lost her?
s07_e17_c11_u246	Probably around gonorrhea.
s07_e17_c12_u247	Hi, honey! I'm home!
s07_e17_c12_u248	(from the bedroom) Don't come in here!
s07_e17_c12_u249	Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
s07_e17_c12_u250	No! We only mess around at his place!
s07_e17_c12_u251	Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
s07_e17_c12_u252	No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
s07_e17_c12_u253	Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
s07_e17_c12_u254	Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
s07_e17_c12_u255	Well then why can't I see it?
s07_e17_c12_u256	Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
s07_e17_c12_u257	Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. (She enters.) Wow! You-you look-hideous.
s07_e17_c12_u258	Really?
s07_e17_c12_u259	Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
s07_e17_c12_u260	Oh because it doesn't-really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
s07_e17_c12_u261	Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
s07_e17_c12_u262	Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
s07_e17_c12_u263	Okay!
s07_e17_c13_u264	(entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? (They ignore her.) Guys?
s07_e17_c13_u265	(without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
s07_e17_c13_u266	All right? What's going on?
s07_e17_c13_u267	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. (She heads for the bedroom.)
s07_e17_c13_u268	Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
s07_e17_c13_u269	Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Y'know, she could use a little-(Whistles that she needs to do what they're doing.) (Something happens on the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)
s01_e07_c01_u001	Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
s01_e07_c01_u002	Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights go out) OK, thank you very much.
s01_e07_c02_u003	Oh, great. This is just...
s01_e07_c03_u004	Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
s01_e07_c03_u005	Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
s01_e07_c03_u006	Wow, you guys, this is big.
s01_e07_c03_u007	(into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs up)
s01_e07_c03_u008	Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to Monica) What's my number?
s01_e07_c03_u009	Well, I never call me.
s01_e07_c04_u010	Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
s01_e07_c04_u011	(on phone) Hi Mom, it's Jill.
s01_e07_c04_u012	She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
s01_e07_c04_u013	(on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
s01_e07_c04_u014	Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
s01_e07_c04_u015	(on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
s01_e07_c04_u016	Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
s01_e07_c05_u017	Hi everyone.
s01_e07_c05_u018	And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
s01_e07_c05_u019	Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
s01_e07_c05_u020	(at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
s01_e07_c05_u021	That had to hurt!
s01_e07_c06_u022	Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
s01_e07_c06_u023	There you go!
s01_e07_c06_u024	You're definitely scaring here.
s01_e07_c06_u025	(awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)
s01_e07_c06_u026	Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)
s01_e07_c07_u027	Hello?
s01_e07_c07_u028	Hey, it's me.
s01_e07_c07_u029	(to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
s01_e07_c07_u030	Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
s01_e07_c07_u031	What?
s01_e07_c07_u032	I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
s01_e07_c07_u033	I have no idea what you just said.
s01_e07_c07_u034	(angry) Put Joey on the phone.
s01_e07_c07_u035	What's up man?
s01_e07_c07_u036	I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
s01_e07_c07_u037	(to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)
s01_e07_c07_u038	Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
s01_e07_c08_u039	Alright, somebody.
s01_e07_c08_u040	OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
s01_e07_c08_u041	Whoooaa!
s01_e07_c08_u042	That's my sister.
s01_e07_c08_u043	OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
s01_e07_c08_u044	Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
s01_e07_c08_u045	Pheebs, what about you?
s01_e07_c08_u046	Oh... Milwaukee.
s01_e07_c08_u047	Um... Ross?
s01_e07_c08_u048	Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
s01_e07_c08_u049	No way!
s01_e07_c08_u050	The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
s01_e07_c08_u051	Oh, Rachel.
s01_e07_c08_u052	Oh come on, I already went.
s01_e07_c08_u053	You did not go!
s01_e07_c08_u054	Come on.
s01_e07_c08_u055	Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed.
s01_e07_c08_u056	Step back.
s01_e07_c08_u057	We have a winner!
s01_e07_c08_u058	I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
s01_e07_c08_u059	Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
s01_e07_c08_u060	There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
s01_e07_c08_u061	Come on.
s01_e07_c08_u062	No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
s01_e07_c08_u063	(sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
s01_e07_c08_u064	I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
s01_e07_c08_u065	Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
s01_e07_c08_u066	Yeah right.
s01_e07_c08_u067	It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
s01_e07_c08_u068	(sigh) OK.
s01_e07_c08_u069	But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
s01_e07_c08_u070	You don't.
s01_e07_c08_u071	Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
s01_e07_c08_u072	Really?
s01_e07_c08_u073	Mmmm.
s01_e07_c08_u074	You do?
s01_e07_c08_u075	I do.
s01_e07_c08_u076	Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
s01_e07_c08_u077	It's never gonna happen.
s01_e07_c08_u078	(innocently) What?
s01_e07_c08_u079	You and Rachel.
s01_e07_c08_u080	(acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
s01_e07_c08_u081	Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
s01_e07_c08_u082	No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
s01_e07_c08_u083	Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
s01_e07_c08_u084	I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
s01_e07_c08_u085	Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
s01_e07_c08_u086	I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?
s01_e07_c08_u087	Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the room behind them)
s01_e07_c08_u088	Shhhh!
s01_e07_c08_u089	What are you shushing?
s01_e07_c08_u090	We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?
s01_e07_c08_u091	Ahhhh!
s01_e07_c08_u092	See?
s01_e07_c08_u093	Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)
s01_e07_c09_u094	Would you like some gum?
s01_e07_c09_u095	Um, is it sugarless?
s01_e07_c09_u096	(checks) Sorry, it's not.
s01_e07_c09_u097	Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
s01_e07_c10_u098	(singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she writes the lyrics down)
s01_e07_c10_u099	(to Joey) OK, here goes.
s01_e07_c10_u100	Are you going to do it?
s01_e07_c10_u101	I'm going to do it.
s01_e07_c10_u102	Do you want any help?
s01_e07_c10_u103	You come out there, you're a dead man.
s01_e07_c10_u104	Good luck, man.
s01_e07_c10_u105	Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
s01_e07_c10_u106	OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
s01_e07_c10_u107	Hey, where are you going?
s01_e07_c10_u108	Outside.
s01_e07_c10_u109	You can't go out there.
s01_e07_c10_u110	Why not?
s01_e07_c10_u111	Because of... the reason.
s01_e07_c10_u112	And that would be?
s01_e07_c10_u113	I, um, can't tell you.
s01_e07_c10_u114	Joey, what's going on?
s01_e07_c10_u115	OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
s01_e07_c10_u116	About what?
s01_e07_c10_u117	He's planning your birthday party.
s01_e07_c10_u118	Oh my God! I love him!
s01_e07_c10_u119	(as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
s01_e07_c10_u120	About what?
s01_e07_c10_u121	My surprise party!
s01_e07_c10_u122	What surprise party?
s01_e07_c10_u123	Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
s01_e07_c10_u124	Well, he didn't tell me.
s01_e07_c10_u125	Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
s01_e07_c10_u126	This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
s01_e07_c10_u127	No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
s01_e07_c10_u128	Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks like I was second to last.
s01_e07_c11_u129	Hmmm... this is so nice.
s01_e07_c11_u130	OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
s01_e07_c11_u131	OK.
s01_e07_c11_u132	OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
s01_e07_c11_u133	Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
s01_e07_c11_u134	Yes, yes, that's right...
s01_e07_c11_u135	Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)
s01_e07_c11_u136	What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
s01_e07_c12_u137	(to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
s01_e07_c12_u138	Sorry, that was wax.
s01_e07_c12_u139	Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
s01_e07_c12_u140	Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
s01_e07_c12_u141	During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
s01_e07_c12_u142	(nonchalantly) Yeah?
s01_e07_c13_u143	You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
s01_e07_c14_u144	(stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
s01_e07_c14_u145	Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
s01_e07_c14_u146	Er, yeah, it's mine.
s01_e07_c14_u147	(trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
s01_e07_c14_u148	Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
s01_e07_c14_u149	Wait a minute. What's his name?
s01_e07_c14_u150	Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
s01_e07_c14_u151	Bob Buttons?
s01_e07_c14_u152	Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
s01_e07_c14_u153	(the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
s01_e07_c14_u154	(as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat.
s01_e07_c15_u155	Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
s01_e07_c15_u156	Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)
s01_e07_c16_u157	(rolling) Lucky sixes....
s01_e07_c16_u158	(entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
s01_e07_c16_u159	(smitten) Hi!
s01_e07_c16_u160	And Joey....
s01_e07_c16_u161	Hi!
s01_e07_c16_u162	And Ross.
s01_e07_c16_u163	Hi!
s01_e07_c16_u164	(proudly) He doesn't speak much English.
s01_e07_c16_u165	Look at that!
s01_e07_c16_u166	(jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?
s01_e07_c16_u167	Oh... Italy, I think.
s01_e07_c16_u168	No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
s01_e07_c16_u169	Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
s01_e07_c16_u170	That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him.
s01_e07_c16_u171	Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
s01_e07_c16_u172	Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
s01_e07_c16_u173	Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
s01_e07_c16_u174	Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
s01_e07_c16_u175	(smiling) You betcha!
s01_e07_c17_u176	(chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
s01_e07_c17_u177	Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
s01_e07_c17_u178	Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
s01_e07_c17_u179	Are you alright?
s01_e07_c17_u180	My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum flies from his mouth) That better?
s01_e07_c17_u181	(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
s01_e07_c17_u182	Perfection?
s01_e07_c18_u183	(mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
s01_e07_c18_u184	Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
s01_e07_c18_u185	I have absolutely no idea.
s01_e07_c18_u186	That's... that's classic.
s01_e07_c18_u187	(to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
s01_e07_c18_u188	If you want, I'll do it.
s01_e07_c18_u189	I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I won't.
s01_e07_c18_u190	God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
s01_e07_c18_u191	You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
s01_e07_c18_u192	Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
s01_e07_c18_u193	Paolo. Hi.
s01_e07_c18_u194	Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
s01_e07_c18_u195	Thing, yes. Thing.
s01_e07_c18_u196	No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
s01_e07_c18_u197	No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
s01_e07_c18_u198	Yeah! Se vice?
s01_e07_c18_u199	So you do know a little English.
s01_e07_c18_u200	Do you know the word crapweasel?
s01_e07_c18_u201	That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
s01_e07_c19_u202	Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
s01_e07_c19_u203	OK.
s01_e07_c19_u204	Ready? (she swings the pen around her head in a circle)
s01_e07_c19_u205	No, you've got to whip it.
s01_e07_c20_u206	Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... (time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark)
s01_e07_c20_u207	Thank you.
s01_e07_c20_u208	Thanks.
s01_e07_c20_u209	Kinda... spooky without any lights.
s01_e07_c20_u210	(does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
s01_e07_c20_u211	OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
s01_e07_c20_u212	Oh.. oh... oh.
s01_e07_c20_u213	Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
s01_e07_c21_u214	Well, this has been fun.
s01_e07_c21_u215	Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
s01_e07_c21_u216	Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the cheek) See ya.
s01_e07_c21_u217	Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
s03_e22_c01_u001	Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
s03_e22_c01_u002	Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.
s03_e22_c01_u003	What's Flimby's?
s03_e22_c01_u004	Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
s03_e22_c01_u005	Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
s03_e22_c01_u006	No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!
s03_e22_c01_u007	Ye-e-es!!
s03_e22_c01_u008	(entering) Hey.
s03_e22_c01_u009	Hey.

s03_e22_c01_u013	Two it is. Ross, how about you?
s03_e22_c01_u014	Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.
s03_e22_c01_u015	Really? Who's number two?
s03_e22_c01_u016	Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
s03_e22_c01_u017	Uh, no, it's-it's just this person.
s03_e22_c01_u018	Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?
s03_e22_c01_u019	Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?
s03_e22_c01_u020	No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so
s03_e22_c01_u021	But you said one.
s03_e22_c01_u022	I meant, me plus one!
s03_e22_c01_u023	Okay. (to Phoebe and Chandler) Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?

s03_e22_c01_u031	Oh!
s03_e22_c01_u032	(to Chandler) And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.
s03_e22_c01_u033	Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody.
s03_e22_c01_u034	Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
s03_e22_c01_u035	The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
s03_e22_c01_u036	Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
s03_e22_c02_u037	(to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)
s03_e22_c02_u038	Thanks!
s03_e22_c02_u039	Uh-huh.
s03_e22_c02_u040	Okay. (on phone) Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. (does so) But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. (starts to put on the sweater) Don't-don't switch or anything, cause I'm, I'm right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just
s03_e22_c02_u041	Phoebe?
s03_e22_c02_u042	What?! Monica, I'm scared!!
s03_e22_c02_u043	All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?

s03_e22_c02_u047	Okay, wait, you gotta hang up cause we're gonna be late.
s03_e22_c02_u048	Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.
s03_e22_c02_u049	Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
s03_e22_c02_u050	(entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
s03_e22_c02_u051	Of course not.
s03_e22_c02_u052	No.
s03_e22_c02_u053	Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.

s03_e22_c04_u091	So, so, what'd ya think?
s03_e22_c04_u092	Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
s03_e22_c04_u093	I-I wasn't in that.
s03_e22_c04_u094	I know.
s03_e22_c04_u095	(sees Kate) Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
s03_e22_c04_u096	Hi!
s03_e22_c04_u097	(stepping in) Excuse me. Excuse me. (to Kate) Sweetheart! (Kisses her.) Come! (They leave.)
s03_e22_c04_u098	So that's the girl you like.
s03_e22_c04_u099	Yeah.
s03_e22_c04_u100	(drags Chandler over to buffet table) I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he's baaad news!
s03_e22_c04_u101	Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd.
s03_e22_c04_u102	Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
s03_e22_c04_u103	Oh, hi!

s03_e22_c04_u105	Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
s03_e22_c04_u106	Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
s03_e22_c04_u107	So. How'd you guys meet?
s03_e22_c04_u108	Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
s03_e22_c04_u109	Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
s03_e22_c04_u110	Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
s03_e22_c04_u111	Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
s03_e22_c04_u112	How do you do. (to Rachel and Monica) Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! (to Joey) Did they have representation?
s03_e22_c04_u113	No, they-they weren't in the play.
s03_e22_c04_u114	We're not actors.
s03_e22_c04_u115	Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face (points to Monica) and her chest (points to Rachel) I could really put something together.
s03_e22_c04_u116	Could I borrow it?
s03_e22_c04_u117	(to Ross) Hi! Remember me?
s03_e22_c04_u118	Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap. (He's watching very intently)
s03_e22_c04_u119	Ross, I'm gonna go.
s03_e22_c04_u120	Go? Why?
s03_e22_c04_u121	I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
s03_e22_c04_u122	But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
s03_e22_c04_u123	Good bye Ross.
s03_e22_c04_u124	Uh, oh-ho bye.
s03_e22_c04_u125	(entering carrying a newspaper) Here we go people! (starts reading the review) Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la- Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
s03_e22_c04_u126	Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
s03_e22_c04_u127	Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. (Kate walks away depressed.) Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is- (stops, reads it again, and throws down the paper in disgust) Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! (starts to leave) Excuse me!!
s03_e22_c04_u128	Anyone mind if I save this?
s03_e22_c05_u129	Hey!
s03_e22_c05_u130	Hey!

s03_e22_c05_u136	Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
s03_e22_c06_u137	Hey! Are you okay?
s03_e22_c06_u138	Fabulous.
s03_e22_c06_u139	Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?
s03_e22_c06_u140	Become a drama critic!
s03_e22_c06_u141	(entering, drunk) I am hurt! (to Joey and Kate) A plague on both your houses! (walks away)
s03_e22_c06_u142	By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
s03_e22_c06_u143	Oh, classy.
s03_e22_c06_u144	Yep! I sure know how to pick em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!

s03_e22_c06_u146	Really. What?
s03_e22_c06_u147	Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
s03_e22_c06_u148	Why the Post?
s03_e22_c06_u149	Oh, you didn't see the Post?
s03_e22_c06_u150	No. You?
s03_e22_c06_u151	No. Why?
s03_e22_c07_u152	(drunk) So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
s03_e22_c07_u153	Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.
s03_e22_c07_u154	Oh, you're sweet and cute.
s03_e22_c07_u155	I know! That's why they trashed me!
s03_e22_c07_u156	Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
s03_e22_c07_u157	What?
s03_e22_c07_u158	I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
s03_e22_c07_u159	What? So you never went out with an actress before?
s03_e22_c07_u160	Kate, do you even like me?
s03_e22_c07_u161	Of course I do.
s03_e22_c07_u162	Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
s03_e22_c07_u163	I don't know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy- Why can't I just pick someone like you?
s03_e22_c07_u164	Thanks.
s03_e22_c07_u165	You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so- (She passes out and slumps against his shoulder.)
s03_e22_c07_u166	(Checks to see if she's drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay, hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let's get your feet up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
s03_e22_c08_u167	Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.
s03_e22_c08_u168	(entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.
s03_e22_c08_u169	No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? Cause of all the riboflavin.

s03_e22_c08_u176	Joey, you had the night!
s03_e22_c08_u177	What?
s03_e22_c08_u178	When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
s03_e22_c08_u179	You-you think?
s03_e22_c08_u180	Did you like learn about her family?
s03_e22_c08_u181	Two brothers, one died!

s03_e22_c08_u183	Yeah?!
s03_e22_c08_u184	Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)

s03_e22_c09_u186	Oh-ho-ho-ho.
s03_e22_c09_u187	Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
s03_e22_c09_u188	What time is it?
s03_e22_c09_u189	One.
s03_e22_c09_u190	One.
s03_e22_c09_u191	7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesn't work.
s03_e22_c09_u192	Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.
s03_e22_c09_u193	Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
s03_e22_c09_u194	You don't?!
s03_e22_c09_u195	No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
s03_e22_c09_u196	Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
s03_e22_c09_u197	No, it's not just cause I'm jealous. (Both Monica and Chandler give him a Come on' look) I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's- Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
s03_e22_c09_u198	Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!
s03_e22_c09_u199	Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine. (starts to leave)
s03_e22_c09_u200	We're kidding!
s03_e22_c09_u201	Ross, don't. Ross!
s03_e22_c09_u202	You don't want to believe me, I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny- (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy)
s03_e22_c09_u203	Whoa!!
s03_e22_c09_u204	Whoa, sorry Tommy.
s03_e22_c09_u205	What's in the cup, Ross?
s03_e22_c09_u206	Umm
s03_e22_c09_u207	What is in the cup?!
s03_e22_c09_u208	Okay, it's coffee.
s03_e22_c09_u209	Ice coffee? Tell me it's ice coffee!
s03_e22_c09_u210	It's-it's hot
s03_e22_c09_u211	Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
s03_e22_c09_u212	(not seeing Ross) What's your favourite thing about summertime?
s03_e22_c09_u213	Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
s03_e22_c09_u214	Yeah
s03_e22_c09_u215	(entering, finished with yelling at Ross, who follows him in shell shocked) (happily) Hey!
s03_e22_c09_u216	Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?
s03_e22_c09_u217	Ooh, I don't know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
s03_e22_c09_u218	Ohh, that's a good one.
s03_e22_c10_u219	Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.
s03_e22_c10_u220	Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let's go! Let's go!
s03_e22_c10_u221	(answering the door) Vic! Where have you been, baby?!
s03_e22_c10_u222	(surprised it's Lauren) (hugs her) (whispering) Where's Kate?
s03_e22_c10_u223	(whispering) She got a job in L.A.
s03_e22_c10_u224	(stunned) What?!
s03_e22_c10_u225	I've been waiting up all night for ya. Where have you been? (Joey doesn't answer) Where have you been? Vic?!
s03_e22_c10_u226	Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
s03_e22_c10_u227	(at the window, she's looking down out of the window) What do you got down there, Vic? What do you got under that tarp?
s03_e22_c10_u228	(grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering) When is she leaving?
s03_e22_c10_u229	(whispering) Tonight. What are you doing?
s03_e22_c10_u230	(making like he is yelling up to the second floor) I'm coming up!
s03_e22_c11_u231	Hey, mind if I use the phone?
s03_e22_c11_u232	Oh, I- (starts jabbering incoherently)
s03_e22_c11_u233	Why don't you use ours across the hall, cause she-has-problems.
s03_e22_c11_u234	(coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
s03_e22_c11_u235	Yeah, but you didn't.
s03_e22_c11_u236	No, but it's-it's-it's hot!
s03_e22_c11_u237	Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old.
s03_e22_c11_u238	I can't believe no one believes me!
s03_e22_c11_u239	I do, I believe you.
s03_e22_c11_u240	You do Pheebs?
s03_e22_c11_u241	Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was next.
s03_e22_c11_u242	(noticing the chick) Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella. (picks up the chick) Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing? (starts to pet him) Aww. (The chick poops on his hand.) Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, I'm so cute, I'm a little chick who's disgusting! God, you're so stupid, how are you not yet extinct!! (the duck wattles behind him and quacks) (to the duck) Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!
s03_e22_c11_u243	Step away from the duck.
s03_e22_c11_u244	Ooh, sorry little Mr. Chic-A-Dee, sorry you went doody in my hand! (starts to walk out and stops) (to Rachel) Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!
s03_e22_c12_u245	Joey!
s03_e22_c12_u246	Hey!
s03_e22_c12_u247	I'm soo glad I caught you, I couldn't find you before.
s03_e22_c12_u248	Wh-wh-what's going on? Wh-what's this about L.A.?
s03_e22_c12_u249	They still want me for General Hospital.
s03_e22_c12_u250	But, but wh-what about us?
s03_e22_c12_u251	Last night was wonderful. But I-I can't stay here just for you.
s03_e22_c12_u252	Well, so, stay for the museums!
s03_e22_c12_u253	I'm sorry.
s03_e22_c12_u254	Joey, onstage!
s03_e22_c12_u255	Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
s03_e22_c12_u256	(yelling from onstage) Where are you Vic?
s03_e22_c12_u257	Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
s03_e22_c12_u258	Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
s03_e22_c12_u259	(to Lauren) In a minute!!
s03_e22_c12_u260	So this is it? Victor?
s03_e22_c12_u261	Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so- I'm gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.
s03_e22_c12_u262	So long, Vic! (waving good bye as the ladder retracts)
s03_e22_c13_u263	Phoebe, it's been two days.
s03_e22_c13_u264	Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?
s03_e22_c13_u265	Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
s03_e22_c13_u266	No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
s03_e22_c13_u267	Phoe-be!!
s03_e22_c13_u268	Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back.
s03_e22_c13_u269	And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone.
s03_e22_c13_u270	Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
s03_e22_c13_u271	Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!
s03_e22_c13_u272	What?
s03_e22_c13_u273	Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call.
s03_e22_c13_u274	(sarcastic) Oh.
s01_e10_c01_u001	Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
s01_e10_c01_u002	Oooh!
s01_e10_c01_u003	W-wait. What is that?
s01_e10_c01_u004	'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
s01_e10_c01_u005	No, no, I don't.
s01_e10_c01_u006	Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
s01_e10_c01_u007	My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
s01_e10_c01_u008	That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
s01_e10_c01_u009	Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
s01_e10_c01_u010	Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
s01_e10_c01_u011	Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
s01_e10_c01_u012	Why don't you just get a roommate?
s01_e10_c01_u013	Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
s01_e10_c02_u014	So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
s01_e10_c02_u015	Might wanna open with the snowman.
s01_e10_c02_u016	All: Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
s01_e10_c02_u017	So, how'd it go?
s01_e10_c02_u018	Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
s01_e10_c02_u019	How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
s01_e10_c02_u020	I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
s01_e10_c02_u021	So what are you gonna be?
s01_e10_c02_u022	Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
s01_e10_c02_u023	Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
s01_e10_c02_u024	Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
s01_e10_c02_u025	Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
s01_e10_c02_u026	Yeah, you wish!
s01_e10_c02_u027	It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
s01_e10_c02_u028	All: Yeah, okay. Alright.
s01_e10_c02_u029	Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
s01_e10_c02_u030	All: Woooo! Yeah!
s01_e10_c02_u031	Phoebe, you're on.
s01_e10_c02_u032	Oh, oh, good.
s01_e10_c02_u033	(Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
s01_e10_c02_u034	(Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:)
s01_e10_c02_u035	(Sung)
s01_e10_c02_u036	(Sung)
s01_e10_c02_u037	No. No, that's- that's okay.
s01_e10_c02_u038	Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
s01_e10_c02_u039	(Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!
s01_e10_c02_u040	Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
s01_e10_c02_u041	Could you speak up please?
s01_e10_c02_u042	(Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
s01_e10_c02_u043	Daryl Hannah.
s01_e10_c02_u044	Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
s01_e10_c02_u045	Hard quality.
s01_e10_c02_u046	-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. (Sits down)
s01_e10_c02_u047	Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)
s01_e10_c02_u048	Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
s01_e10_c03_u049	Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)
s01_e10_c03_u050	Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
s01_e10_c03_u051	Just a smidge.
s01_e10_c03_u052	David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
s01_e10_c03_u053	I think it's romantic.
s01_e10_c03_u054	Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
s01_e10_c03_u055	Yeah!
s01_e10_c03_u056	Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
s01_e10_c03_u057	Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
s01_e10_c03_u058	No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
s01_e10_c03_u059	Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
s01_e10_c03_u060	What?!
s01_e10_c03_u061	C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
s01_e10_c03_u062	I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
s01_e10_c03_u063	Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
s01_e10_c03_u064	I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
s01_e10_c03_u065	Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
s01_e10_c03_u066	Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
s01_e10_c03_u067	Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)
s01_e10_c03_u068	Aah, y'killing me!
s01_e10_c03_u069	Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
s01_e10_c03_u070	Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
s01_e10_c03_u071	Do you always have to bring him here?
s01_e10_c03_u072	I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
s01_e10_c03_u073	Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
s01_e10_c03_u074	Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
s01_e10_c03_u075	Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
s01_e10_c04_u076	...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.
s01_e10_c04_u077	Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
s01_e10_c04_u078	Yuh.
s01_e10_c04_u079	Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
s01_e10_c04_u080	Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
s01_e10_c04_u081	Sure.
s01_e10_c04_u082	Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
s01_e10_c04_u083	Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
s01_e10_c04_u084	Rrrreally.
s01_e10_c04_u085	Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
s01_e10_c04_u086	...Now? Now?
s01_e10_c04_u087	Oh yeah, right now.
s01_e10_c04_u088	Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)
s01_e10_c04_u089	Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
s01_e10_c04_u090	Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
s01_e10_c04_u091	I can hop. (She hops onto the table)
s01_e10_c05_u092	So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
s01_e10_c05_u093	I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
s01_e10_c05_u094	Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
s01_e10_c05_u095	Yeah.
s01_e10_c05_u096	You know more than one Fun Bobby?
s01_e10_c05_u097	I happen to know a Fun Bob.
s01_e10_c05_u098	(Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...
s01_e10_c05_u099	Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
s01_e10_c05_u100	(Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.
s01_e10_c05_u101	Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
s01_e10_c05_u102	Uh, four.
s01_e10_c05_u103	Four.
s01_e10_c05_u104	Five.
s01_e10_c05_u105	Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
s01_e10_c05_u106	Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
s01_e10_c05_u107	Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
s01_e10_c05_u108	Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
s01_e10_c05_u109	Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
s01_e10_c05_u110	Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
s01_e10_c05_u111	What's the matter?
s01_e10_c05_u112	Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
s01_e10_c05_u113	That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
s01_e10_c05_u114	Really.
s01_e10_c05_u115	Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
s01_e10_c05_u116	What, uh... what juggling thing?
s01_e10_c05_u117	With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
s01_e10_c05_u118	No.
s01_e10_c05_u119	Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
s01_e10_c05_u120	Phoebe. Hi.
s01_e10_c05_u121	Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
s01_e10_c05_u122	No. Have you seen David?
s01_e10_c05_u123	No, no, he hasn't been around.
s01_e10_c05_u124	Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
s01_e10_c05_u125	Minsk?
s01_e10_c05_u126	Minsk. It's in Russia.
s01_e10_c05_u127	I know where Minsk is.
s01_e10_c05_u128	We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
s01_e10_c05_u129	So when, when do you leave?
s01_e10_c05_u130	January first.
s01_e10_c06_u131	Hello?
s01_e10_c06_u132	Hey!
s01_e10_c06_u133	Hi.
s01_e10_c06_u134	Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?
s01_e10_c06_u135	Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting!
s01_e10_c06_u136	It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
s01_e10_c06_u137	Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?
s01_e10_c06_u138	Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' (Storms out)
s01_e10_c06_u139	Thank you, Max. Thank you.
s01_e10_c06_u140	So-so you're really not going?
s01_e10_c06_u141	I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
s01_e10_c06_u142	Oh don't do that.
s01_e10_c06_u143	Please.
s01_e10_c06_u144	Oh no no.
s01_e10_c06_u145	No, but I'm asking-
s01_e10_c06_u146	Oh, but I can't do that-
s01_e10_c06_u147	No, but I can't-
s01_e10_c06_u148	It's your thing, and-
s01_e10_c06_u149	-make the decision-
s01_e10_c06_u150	Okay, um, stay.
s01_e10_c06_u151	Stay.
s01_e10_c06_u152	Stay.
s01_e10_c06_u153	Getting so good at that! (She hops on)
s01_e10_c06_u154	It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)
s01_e10_c07_u155	I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)
s01_e10_c07_u156	You remember Janice.
s01_e10_c07_u157	Vividly.
s01_e10_c07_u158	Hi.
s01_e10_c07_u159	Hi, I'm Sandy.
s01_e10_c07_u160	Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids.
s01_e10_c07_u161	Yeah. That's okay, right?
s01_e10_c07_u162	Par-tay!
s01_e10_c07_u163	That thing is not coming in here.
s01_e10_c07_u164	'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
s01_e10_c07_u165	I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
s01_e10_c07_u166	Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
s01_e10_c07_u167	Alright. Just keep him away from me.
s01_e10_c07_u168	Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
s01_e10_c07_u169	Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
s01_e10_c07_u170	Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
s01_e10_c07_u171	And then... your face is bloated?
s01_e10_c07_u172	No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
s01_e10_c07_u173	Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.
s01_e10_c07_u174	Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
s01_e10_c07_u175	Yeah.
s01_e10_c07_u176	Hey, kids...
s01_e10_c07_u177	(Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
s01_e10_c07_u178	(Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
s01_e10_c07_u179	(Imitating) But you found me!
s01_e10_c07_u180	Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
s01_e10_c07_u181	Kill me. Kill me now.
s01_e10_c07_u182	Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
s01_e10_c07_u183	Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
s01_e10_c07_u184	(Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
s01_e10_c07_u185	It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.
s01_e10_c07_u186	(Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
s01_e10_c07_u187	Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
s01_e10_c07_u188	Oh, no. Oh, no.
s01_e10_c07_u189	I'm sorry you misunderstood...
s01_e10_c07_u190	Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)
s01_e10_c07_u191	Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)
s01_e10_c07_u192	Hi, Max!
s01_e10_c07_u193	Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
s01_e10_c07_u194	Wow.
s01_e10_c07_u195	It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)
s01_e10_c07_u196	Are you alright?
s01_e10_c07_u197	Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
s01_e10_c07_u198	You're going to Minsk.
s01_e10_c07_u199	No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
s01_e10_c07_u200	Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
s01_e10_c07_u201	Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
s01_e10_c07_u202	Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
s01_e10_c07_u203	Uh, ow.
s01_e10_c07_u204	Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
s01_e10_c07_u205	I'll never forget you.
s01_e10_c07_u206	And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
s01_e10_c07_u207	(on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
s01_e10_c07_u208	There y'go, kids.
s01_e10_c07_u209	(To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)
s01_e10_c07_u210	You seen Sandy?
s01_e10_c07_u211	Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
s01_e10_c07_u212	Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
s01_e10_c07_u213	The bll is drrbing!
s01_e10_c07_u214	(on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
s01_e10_c07_u215	And the moment of joy is upon us.
s01_e10_c07_u216	Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
s01_e10_c07_u217	Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
s01_e10_c07_u218	Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
s01_e10_c07_u219	Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)
s01_e10_c07_u220	I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
s01_e10_c07_u221	I can't kiss anyone.
s01_e10_c07_u222	So I'm kissing everyone?
s01_e10_c07_u223	Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
s01_e10_c07_u224	Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
s01_e10_c07_u225	Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
s01_e10_c07_u226	Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
s01_e10_c08_u227	(Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
s01_e10_c08_u228	...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
s07_e15_c01_u001	I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
s07_e15_c01_u002	(starting to cry) Ohh
s07_e15_c01_u003	What's the matter? You okay?
s07_e15_c01_u004	Yeah, it's just y'know
s07_e15_c01_u005	(To Ross) Monica said wedding.
s07_e15_c01_u006	Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
s07_e15_c01_u007	Oh! I would love to read a poem.
s07_e15_c01_u008	Do you think you could get through a poem?
s07_e15_c01_u009	(crying) It'll be a short one.
s07_e15_c01_u010	Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
s07_e15_c01_u011	Ohhh
s07_e15_c01_u012	Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
s07_e15_c01_u013	Too?
s07_e15_c01_u014	Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
s07_e15_c01_u015	Do you mind telling us what it is?
s07_e15_c01_u016	Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
s07_e15_c01_u017	Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)
s07_e15_c01_u018	(entering, excited) Hey!
s07_e15_c01_u019	Hey!
s07_e15_c01_u020	So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and
s07_e15_c01_u021	What is DOOL?
s07_e15_c01_u022	Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
s07_e15_c01_u023	Oh!!
s07_e15_c01_u024	That's great!
s07_e15_c01_u025	And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
s07_e15_c01_u026	So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
s07_e15_c01_u027	Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
s07_e15_c01_u028	Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
s07_e15_c01_u029	What? A brain transplant?!
s07_e15_c01_u030	(seriously) Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
s07_e15_c01_u031	It's ridiculous!
s07_e15_c01_u032	Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
s07_e15_c01_u033	(to Monica and Rachel) It's winter, they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)
s07_e15_c01_u034	Who are they killing off?
s07_e15_c01_u035	Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
s07_e15_c01_u036	She's my favorite character on DOOL.
s07_e15_c01_u037	Nice.
s07_e15_c01_u038	She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
s07_e15_c01_u039	And the way she slaps all the time!
s07_e15_c01_u040	Oh!
s07_e15_c01_u041	Wouldn't you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards Chandler.)
s07_e15_c01_u042	Don't do it.
s07_e15_c01_u043	Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
s07_e15_c01_u044	Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
s07_e15_c01_u045	Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
s07_e15_c01_u046	Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
s07_e15_c02_u047	(Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
s07_e15_c02_u048	(They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay.
s07_e15_c02_u049	Yeah? Why?
s07_e15_c02_u050	Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
s07_e15_c02_u051	Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
s07_e15_c02_u052	Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
s07_e15_c02_u053	(A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)
s07_e15_c02_u054	All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)
s07_e15_c02_u055	Ohh, he left his cell phone.
s07_e15_c02_u056	Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
s07_e15_c02_u057	Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
s07_e15_c02_u058	What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
s07_e15_c02_u059	Yeah- That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both get up.)
s07_e15_c02_u060	What? Wait! Why-why do you get the story?
s07_e15_c02_u061	I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
s07_e15_c02_u062	Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
s07_e15_c02_u063	That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together-(quietly) having sex.
s07_e15_c02_u064	Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
s07_e15_c02_u065	No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
s07_e15_c02_u066	Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
s07_e15_c02_u067	Nice try.
s07_e15_c02_u068	Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
s07_e15_c02_u069	I don't know.
s07_e15_c02_u070	Well umm, maybe we could uhh- (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!!
s07_e15_c02_u071	Ah-ha! Too cocky!
s07_e15_c03_u072	I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
s07_e15_c03_u073	Oh yes there is!
s07_e15_c03_u074	What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
s07_e15_c03_u075	(gasps) That was an accident! And so were you.
s07_e15_c03_u076	Well, at least I'm not a murderer! (Jessica slaps her.)
s07_e15_c03_u077	(crying) Oh, my baby! (Hugs Dina, but moves Dina's head to her other shoulder so that she's the only one in the picture.)
s07_e15_c03_u078	That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
s07_e15_c03_u079	Oh, just years of experience.
s07_e15_c03_u080	(crying) Can I get some ice here?!
s07_e15_c03_u081	Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
s07_e15_c03_u082	You're not the fan who's dying are you?
s07_e15_c03_u083	Say what?
s07_e15_c03_u084	I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until (to no one in particular) later!
s07_e15_c03_u085	No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
s07_e15_c03_u086	Oh that was a real person?!
s07_e15_c03_u087	An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
s07_e15_c03_u088	I-I-I'm leaving the show?
s07_e15_c03_u089	(quickly) I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
s07_e15_c03_u090	Who told you that?
s07_e15_c03_u091	Oh uh, one of the writers.
s07_e15_c03_u092	Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
s07_e15_c03_u093	Umm
s07_e15_c03_u094	Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
s07_e15_c03_u095	Okay.
s07_e15_c03_u096	And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip! (She throws her drink in his face.)
s07_e15_c03_u097	Ms. Monroe- (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received.)
s07_e15_c04_u098	No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
s07_e15_c04_u099	Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
s07_e15_c04_u100	I don't think so.
s07_e15_c04_u101	(handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
s07_e15_c04_u102	(checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
s07_e15_c04_u103	Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
s07_e15_c04_u104	Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
s07_e15_c04_u105	Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
s07_e15_c04_u106	Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn't telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
s07_e15_c04_u107	Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
s07_e15_c04_u108	(looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
s07_e15_c04_u109	So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
s07_e15_c04_u110	(showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
s07_e15_c05_u111	What is that?
s07_e15_c05_u112	I think it's the dying cat parade.
s07_e15_c05_u113	It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
s07_e15_c05_u114	(turning around and looking) Oh my God!
s07_e15_c05_u115	What?
s07_e15_c05_u116	Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
s07_e15_c05_u117	Nooo!!
s07_e15_c05_u118	Yes!!
s07_e15_c06_u119	No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
s07_e15_c06_u120	Why is your family Ross?!
s07_e15_c06_u121	He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
s07_e15_c06_u122	If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
s07_e15_c07_u123	Hi Pheebs!
s07_e15_c07_u124	Hi!
s07_e15_c07_u125	How are ya?
s07_e15_c07_u126	Good.
s07_e15_c07_u127	Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
s07_e15_c07_u128	Yeah.
s07_e15_c07_u129	And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
s07_e15_c07_u130	Yeah!
s07_e15_c07_u131	And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
s07_e15_c07_u132	Ooh, now you lost me.
s07_e15_c07_u133	You stole the phone!
s07_e15_c07_u134	No I didn't!
s07_e15_c07_u135	No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
s07_e15_c07_u136	No.
s07_e15_c07_u137	Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe's bag starts to ring.) Oh, it does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe's handbag.)
s07_e15_c07_u138	Phoebe!
s07_e15_c07_u139	That is a different phone.
s07_e15_c07_u140	Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy's phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her phone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please. (To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) It's for me!
s07_e15_c07_u141	That is damning evidence.
s07_e15_c07_u142	Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be (Happily) Hi! It's Rach- (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel's hand, catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!
s07_e15_c07_u143	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
s07_e15_c07_u144	Phoebe! You can't do th
s07_e15_c07_u145	(To Rachel) Shhh! I'm on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. (Listens) Okay, well okay I'll see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)
s07_e15_c07_u146	You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
s07_e15_c07_u147	Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
s07_e15_c07_u148	You just said it!
s07_e15_c07_u149	Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just-be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
s07_e15_c07_u150	Oh Phoebe!
s07_e15_c07_u151	What?! That's the first time today!
s07_e15_c07_u152	Ohh! (Exits.)
s07_e15_c08_u153	So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to
s07_e15_c08_u154	(interrupting) I'm 16.
s07_e15_c08_u155	See you in 2003. (She walks away.)
s07_e15_c08_u156	(walking up) You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
s07_e15_c08_u157	I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
s07_e15_c08_u158	Yeah, thanks.
s07_e15_c08_u159	No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
s07_e15_c08_u160	Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
s07_e15_c08_u161	Joey.
s07_e15_c08_u162	Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. (She throws her drink on a passing writer.)
s07_e15_c08_u163	It wasn't my decision!
s07_e15_c08_u164	(to him) I'm having a conversation here! (To Joey) You were saying?
s07_e15_c08_u165	Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
s07_e15_c08_u166	All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
s07_e15_c08_u167	Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
s07_e15_c08_u168	You're so welcome.
s07_e15_c08_u169	Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? (In a British accent.) "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
s07_e15_c08_u170	Is that supposed to be me?
s07_e15_c08_u171	Yeah.
s07_e15_c08_u172	Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
s07_e15_c08_u173	(shocked) I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
s07_e15_c09_u174	Well, I feel like a snack!
s07_e15_c09_u175	Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
s07_e15_c09_u176	Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
s07_e15_c09_u177	What?!
s07_e15_c09_u178	Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by-Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
s07_e15_c09_u179	Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
s07_e15_c09_u180	No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
s07_e15_c09_u181	Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
s07_e15_c09_u182	(interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
s07_e15_c09_u183	How did you know about that?!
s07_e15_c09_u184	We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
s07_e15_c09_u185	Were you the ones called the cops?!
s07_e15_c09_u186	That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
s07_e15_c09_u187	Why not?
s07_e15_c09_u188	Because we hate them.
s07_e15_c09_u189	Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
s07_e15_c09_u190	We have heard you play.
s07_e15_c09_u191	No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
s07_e15_c10_u192	So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. (Joey is nodding.) You try.
s07_e15_c10_u193	Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed) All right!
s07_e15_c10_u194	No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
s07_e15_c10_u195	Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
s07_e15_c10_u196	Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! (Joey gets a snooty look on his face.) All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. (Joey is pleased.) Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
s07_e15_c10_u197	Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
s07_e15_c10_u198	I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
s07_e15_c10_u199	Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
s07_e15_c10_u200	I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And- Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
s07_e15_c10_u201	Like-like what?
s07_e15_c10_u202	Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
s07_e15_c10_u203	(impressed) Wow!
s07_e15_c10_u204	But- Well now, now's a different time for me. (Starts to cry.)
s07_e15_c10_u205	Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" (She's not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
s07_e15_c10_u206	(intrigued) You think I'm hot?
s07_e15_c10_u207	You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We should probably get-get uh
s07_e15_c10_u208	Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the- (Pause) So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face. (She does so.)
s07_e15_c10_u209	Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that cause she's so passionate?
s07_e15_c10_u210	No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! (She takes her hands off his face.) Do you wanna try it?
s07_e15_c10_u211	Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
s07_e15_c10_u212	That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like- (She grabs the back of his neck and kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)
s07_e15_c11_u213	Hey! Hey!
s07_e15_c11_u214	Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
s07_e15_c11_u215	Well why shouldn't I?!
s07_e15_c11_u216	Because it's my apartment!
s07_e15_c11_u217	Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
s07_e15_c11_u218	Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
s07_e15_c11_u219	Hi!
s07_e15_c11_u220	(To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
s07_e15_c11_u221	(laughs) You're not the man who left the cell phone.
s07_e15_c11_u222	No that's my assistant.
s07_e15_c11_u223	Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
s07_e15_c11_u224	Umm, no.
s07_e15_c11_u225	Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
s07_e15_c11_u226	Sure!
s07_e15_c11_u227	We'll be right back sir.
s07_e15_c11_u228	Sure.
s07_e15_c11_u229	Wh-what do we do?
s07_e15_c11_u230	I don't know!
s07_e15_c11_u231	Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
s07_e15_c11_u232	I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!
s07_e15_c11_u233	Hmm, they just don't make em like that anymore!
s07_e15_c11_u234	(turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
s07_e15_c11_u235	Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
s07_e15_c11_u236	(fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
s07_e15_c11_u237	Yeah! You're such a great friend!
s07_e15_c11_u238	Ohh
s07_e15_c11_u239	So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
s07_e15_c11_u240	Oh that'd be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.
s07_e15_c11_u241	Okay. Okay. (Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)
s07_e15_c11_u242	(whispering) Nice!
s07_e15_c12_u243	Well, you certainly own that room.
s07_e15_c12_u244	Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
s07_e15_c12_u245	Hi.
s07_e15_c12_u246	Hey!
s07_e15_c12_u247	Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
s07_e15_c12_u248	Well, it's nice to know that you
s07_e15_c12_u249	(screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monica's.)
s07_e15_c12_u250	That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
s07_e15_c12_u251	Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
s07_e15_c12_u252	(shrugs) Sure. Yep.
s07_e15_c12_u253	(entering with Rachel) Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
s07_e15_c12_u254	Certainly.
s07_e15_c12_u255	Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to her cheek.)
s07_e15_c12_u256	I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
s07_e15_c12_u257	God. You seem really, really nice.
s07_e15_c12_u258	Okay, bye-bye.
s07_e15_c12_u259	I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
s07_e15_c12_u260	All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)
s07_e15_c12_u261	Okay.
s07_e15_c12_u262	(breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To Cecilia) Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
s07_e15_c12_u263	I really can't slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)
s07_e15_c12_u264	You are so beautiful.
s07_e15_c12_u265	Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
s07_e15_c12_u266	Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I
s07_e15_c12_u267	Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
s07_e15_c12_u268	(notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!
s07_e15_c12_u269	What?
s07_e15_c12_u270	They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
s07_e15_c12_u271	They don't?
s07_e15_c12_u272	Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes what that means.) Oh
s07_e15_c12_u273	How does it happen?
s07_e15_c12_u274	(flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
s07_e15_c12_u275	Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
s07_e15_c12_u276	Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
s07_e15_c13_u277	now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
s07_e15_c13_u278	(giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
s07_e15_c13_u279	(To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
s07_e15_c13_u280	No!
s07_e15_c13_u281	(stands up) Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
s07_e15_c13_u282	One, two, three, four!
s07_e15_c13_u283	You know the song! Sing along!
s07_e15_c13_u284	So?
s07_e15_c14_u285	Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
s07_e15_c14_u286	I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours. (They move into kiss but; they're stopped by Joey entering with a huge bandage wrapped around his head.)
s07_e15_c14_u287	(as Jessica) I don't think so.
s07_e15_c14_u288	Who are you?!
s07_e15_c14_u289	What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own (Does a hair flip) mother?!
s07_e15_c14_u290	(running out to Joey) That was so wonderful! (Hugs him) Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
s07_e15_c14_u291	Oh noo
s07_e15_c14_u292	Well of course not, but you were very good.
s07_e15_c14_u293	Thanks!
s07_e15_c14_u294	And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
s07_e15_c14_u295	Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
s07_e15_c14_u296	A film in Guadalajara!
s07_e15_c14_u297	The airport?
s07_e15_c14_u298	No that's La Guardia. (Joey nods in recognition.) This is Mexico.
s07_e15_c14_u299	Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
s07_e15_c14_u300	Eight months.
s07_e15_c14_u301	That's a really long time.
s07_e15_c14_u302	Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
s07_e15_c14_u303	Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. (Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
s07_e15_c14_u304	That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
s07_e15_c14_u305	Good luck.
s07_e15_c14_u306	You too.
s07_e15_c15_u307	You know the song! Sing along!
s07_e15_c15_u308	Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
s06_e03_c01_u001	(entering) Hey!
s06_e03_c01_u002	Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
s06_e03_c01_u003	(To Chandler) Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
s06_e03_c01_u004	(entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
s06_e03_c01_u005	Uh-huh, what?
s06_e03_c01_u006	Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful
s06_e03_c01_u007	Oh!
s06_e03_c01_u008	how about I move in with you?
s06_e03_c01_u009	Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
s06_e03_c01_u010	Who's Denise?
s06_e03_c01_u011	My roommate.
s06_e03_c01_u012	You have a roommate?!
s06_e03_c01_u013	Yes, Denise. Denise!
s06_e03_c01_u014	Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
s06_e03_c01_u015	Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
s06_e03_c01_u016	Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
s06_e03_c01_u017	Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place
s06_e03_c01_u018	Oh, that's true.
s06_e03_c01_u019	Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?
s06_e03_c01_u020	Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.
s06_e03_c01_u021	Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
s06_e03_c02_u022	Hey.
s06_e03_c02_u023	Hey!
s06_e03_c02_u024	So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
s06_e03_c02_u025	Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
s06_e03_c02_u026	You didn't tell her did you?
s06_e03_c02_u027	No.
s06_e03_c02_u028	Of course not, because you're in love with her.
s06_e03_c02_u029	I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
s06_e03_c02_u030	What do you mean, comforted her?
s06_e03_c02_u031	It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.
s06_e03_c02_u032	Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
s06_e03_c02_u033	It's also a sign of friendship.
s06_e03_c02_u034	Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of Ross's cookie.)
s06_e03_c02_u035	(grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!
s06_e03_c02_u036	Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
s06_e03_c02_u037	S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
s06_e03_c02_u038	Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.
s06_e03_c02_u039	I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh-coconutty. (Phoebe raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
s06_e03_c02_u040	(taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.
s06_e03_c02_u041	(grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
s06_e03_c02_u042	Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
s06_e03_c03_u043	Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.
s06_e03_c03_u044	Who was it?
s06_e03_c03_u045	I don't know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez! (Exits.)
s06_e03_c03_u046	Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
s06_e03_c03_u047	Sure!
s06_e03_c03_u048	Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.
s06_e03_c03_u049	Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
s06_e03_c03_u050	No.
s06_e03_c03_u051	Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
s06_e03_c03_u052	Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
s06_e03_c03_u053	So, that's it?
s06_e03_c03_u054	I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
s06_e03_c03_u055	Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
s06_e03_c03_u056	What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
s06_e03_c03_u057	I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
s06_e03_c03_u058	Are you mocking me?
s06_e03_c03_u059	No, I'm not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)
s06_e03_c04_u060	Hey, what's up?
s06_e03_c04_u061	Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
s06_e03_c04_u062	But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. (Shows him the paper.)
s06_e03_c04_u063	(reading the ad) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
s06_e03_c04_u064	Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.) Not just a hat rack my friend!
s06_e03_c05_u065	Pheebs, I have to ask you
s06_e03_c05_u066	Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
s06_e03_c05_u067	You're just staring into space.
s06_e03_c05_u068	Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil. (There's a pencil lying on the table.)
s06_e03_c05_u069	This one? (Picks it up.)
s06_e03_c05_u070	It worked!
s06_e03_c05_u071	Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and starts to read it.) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!
s06_e03_c05_u072	Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay-" Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
s06_e03_c05_u073	(entering) Hey!
s06_e03_c05_u074	Hey.
s06_e03_c05_u075	Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
s06_e03_c05_u076	Yeah! Why?
s06_e03_c05_u077	Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
s06_e03_c05_u078	That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
s06_e03_c05_u079	Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. (Rachel just looks at him.) Here's Warren's number.
s06_e03_c05_u080	Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank you!
s06_e03_c05_u081	Okay, you go grab it!
s06_e03_c05_u082	I saw it.
s06_e03_c05_u083	I don't know what you're talking about.
s06_e03_c05_u084	Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
s06_e03_c05_u085	Look, I do not re-love her.
s06_e03_c05_u086	I can't believe you won't just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
s06_e03_c05_u087	Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
s06_e03_c05_u088	(returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
s06_e03_c05_u089	You can live with me.
s06_e03_c05_u090	What?!
s06_e03_c05_u091	What?!
s06_e03_c05_u092	What?
s06_e03_c06_u093	Oh my God! Are you serious?!
s06_e03_c06_u094	Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)
s06_e03_c06_u095	I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
s06_e03_c06_u096	Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.
s06_e03_c06_u097	Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so, not stupid.
s06_e03_c06_u098	Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!
s06_e03_c06_u099	Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.
s06_e03_c06_u100	Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses him on the cheek and exits.)
s06_e03_c06_u101	Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?
s06_e03_c06_u102	No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay, that's a lie.
s06_e03_c07_u103	Hi.
s06_e03_c07_u104	Hi.
s06_e03_c07_u105	Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can em-Now, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women
s06_e03_c07_u106	Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) I'm sorry too.
s06_e03_c07_u107	Really?
s06_e03_c07_u108	Yeah! Oh yes!
s06_e03_c07_u109	Ohh.
s06_e03_c07_u110	Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
s06_e03_c07_u111	That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
s06_e03_c07_u112	Totally!
s06_e03_c07_u113	We don't have to come up with this now.
s06_e03_c07_u114	Oh good.
s06_e03_c07_u115	Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
s06_e03_c07_u116	Changes?
s06_e03_c07_u117	Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)
s06_e03_c07_u118	You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
s06_e03_c07_u119	Is that a problem?
s06_e03_c07_u120	Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.
s06_e03_c07_u121	Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
s06_e03_c07_u122	See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
s06_e03_c07_u123	Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
s06_e03_c07_u124	Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!
s06_e03_c07_u125	In the game room!
s06_e03_c07_u126	Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
s06_e03_c07_u127	All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!! (Storms out.)
s06_e03_c08_u128	(exiting from Chandler's room with the new roommate) Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
s06_e03_c08_u129	Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.
s06_e03_c08_u130	Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
s06_e03_c08_u131	(entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! I'll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)
s06_e03_c08_u132	Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.
s06_e03_c08_u133	Why did you take the shower curtain down?
s06_e03_c08_u134	That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I'm very safety conscious.
s06_e03_c09_u135	Hey!
s06_e03_c09_u136	Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
s06_e03_c09_u137	Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
s06_e03_c09_u138	What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?
s06_e03_c09_u139	No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
s06_e03_c09_u140	What?! Over a stupid room!
s06_e03_c09_u141	Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched cause I don't have to move in here!
s06_e03_c09_u142	Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!
s06_e03_c10_u143	What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!
s06_e03_c10_u144	Ross, we can handle this.
s06_e03_c10_u145	Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!
s06_e03_c10_u146	Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)
s06_e03_c10_u147	(stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
s06_e03_c10_u148	Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
s06_e03_c10_u149	Love is the best medicine.
s06_e03_c10_u150	That's laughter.
s06_e03_c10_u151	Why do you do it?
s06_e03_c10_u152	I don't know.
s06_e03_c10_u153	Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
s06_e03_c10_u154	Yeah, I do.
s06_e03_c10_u155	And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?
s06_e03_c10_u156	Yes.
s06_e03_c10_u157	(jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! (Storms out.)
s06_e03_c11_u158	So I understand you're looking for a place.
s06_e03_c11_u159	No-no, I'm staying put.
s06_e03_c11_u160	Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
s06_e03_c11_u161	Why, where are you going?
s06_e03_c11_u162	I don't know.
s06_e03_c11_u163	(entering) Hey Rach!
s06_e03_c11_u164	Hi!
s06_e03_c11_u165	You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?
s06_e03_c11_u166	Oh wow.
s06_e03_c11_u167	Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
s06_e03_c11_u168	Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
s06_e03_c11_u169	Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
s06_e03_c11_u170	Well, because of us! Because of our history.
s06_e03_c11_u171	No!
s06_e03_c11_u172	No?
s06_e03_c11_u173	No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
s06_e03_c11_u174	No! Not at all!
s06_e03_c11_u175	Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
s06_e03_c11_u176	Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
s06_e03_c11_u177	Really?! We are?
s06_e03_c11_u178	Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend
s06_e03_c11_u179	Ohh! That would be great.
s06_e03_c11_u180	But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky." (Laughs.)
s06_e03_c11_u181	(laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn't think of that.
s06_e03_c12_u182	So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
s06_e03_c12_u183	That's very funny!
s06_e03_c12_u184	He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
s06_e03_c12_u185	No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!
s06_e03_c12_u186	Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
s06_e03_c12_u187	Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room-represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel's room) could destroy you!!
s06_e03_c12_u188	Yeah, I'm not so worried.
s06_e03_c12_u189	Yeah, no, me neither.
s06_e03_c12_u190	Fine! It's your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.) I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON'T DO IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)
s06_e03_c12_u191	You still want to move in together right?
s06_e03_c12_u192	Of course!
s06_e03_c12_u193	Ross didn't scare you?
s06_e03_c12_u194	Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
s06_e03_c12_u195	Come here, I want to show you something!
s06_e03_c12_u196	Okay!
s06_e03_c12_u197	Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
s06_e03_c12_u198	This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
s06_e03_c12_u199	Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
s06_e03_c12_u200	Okay!
s06_e03_c12_u201	Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
s06_e03_c12_u202	Uh-hmm.
s06_e03_c12_u203	Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!
s06_e03_c12_u204	Oh my God! I love that!
s06_e03_c12_u205	Really?!
s06_e03_c12_u206	Uh, no!!
s06_e03_c13_u207	(singing) I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair
s06_e03_c13_u208	Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
s06_e03_c13_u209	(To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?
s06_e03_c13_u210	Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
s06_e03_c13_u211	Fighting?!
s06_e03_c13_u212	No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.
s06_e03_c13_u213	Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?
s06_e03_c13_u214	Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
s06_e03_c13_u215	Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)
s06_e03_c13_u216	Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
s06_e03_c13_u217	Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind. (She exits)
s06_e03_c13_u218	Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
s06_e03_c13_u219	I've been back and forth.
s06_e03_c13_u220	Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!
s06_e03_c13_u221	Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.
s06_e03_c13_u222	That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, "Oh that's okay. You'll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!
s06_e03_c13_u223	Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.
s06_e03_c13_u224	I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?
s06_e03_c13_u225	Is that what I want?
s06_e03_c13_u226	(on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.
s06_e03_c13_u227	Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.
s06_e03_c13_u228	All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.
s06_e03_c13_u229	Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)
s06_e03_c13_u230	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
s06_e03_c13_u231	No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no- It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!
s06_e03_c13_u232	Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.
s06_e03_c13_u233	Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
s06_e03_c14_u234	(opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!
s06_e03_c14_u235	Hi!
s06_e03_c14_u236	Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
s06_e03_c14_u237	Great!
s06_e03_c14_u238	Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
s06_e03_c14_u239	I can do that.
s06_e03_c14_u240	Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
s06_e03_c14_u241	Fight.
s06_e03_c14_u242	Very good! Okay. G.
s06_e03_c14_u243	String?
s06_e03_c14_u244	Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
s06_e03_c14_u245	Kitten?
s06_e03_c14_u246	Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye! (He ushers her out the door.)
s04_e03_c01_u001	Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!
s04_e03_c02_u002	(Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?
s04_e03_c02_u003	Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
s04_e03_c02_u004	I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
s04_e03_c02_u005	How come?
s04_e03_c02_u006	You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
s04_e03_c03_u007	(laughs) You ah, you didn't say Yes' to that did you?
s04_e03_c03_u008	(Coming out of the shower wearing nothing but a towel) Hello, Rachel. (She goes into Chandler's bedroom)
s04_e03_c03_u009	Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
s04_e03_c03_u010	Thank you.
s04_e03_c03_u011	I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
s04_e03_c04_u012	Yeah, I thought it was cute.
s04_e03_c04_u013	Hmm.
s04_e03_c05_u014	I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
s04_e03_c06_u015	No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
s04_e03_c06_u016	You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
s04_e03_c07_u017	I'm getting dressed.
s04_e03_c07_u018	Wait. I wanna show you something.
s04_e03_c07_u019	What is it?
s04_e03_c07_u020	Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. (She's holding a pair of handcuffs) Put your hands together.
s09_e20_c01_u001	(enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
s09_e20_c01_u002	(browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
s09_e20_c01_u003	Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
s09_e20_c01_u004	I could fall asleep at a play.
s09_e20_c01_u005	What is it?
s09_e20_c01_u006	It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
s09_e20_c01_u007	It sounds interesting!
s09_e20_c01_u008	Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)
s09_e20_c01_u009	I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
s09_e20_c01_u010	You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!
s09_e20_c01_u011	What? How come that you don't have to go!
s09_e20_c01_u012	I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
s09_e20_c01_u013	(browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
s09_e20_c01_u014	(gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
s09_e20_c01_u015	(lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.
s09_e20_c01_u016	Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?
s09_e20_c01_u017	Yeah.
s09_e20_c01_u018	Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
s09_e20_c01_u019	No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
s09_e20_c01_u020	No reason.
s09_e20_c01_u021	No, no, Rachel?
s09_e20_c01_u022	Yeah
s09_e20_c01_u023	Who do you wanna fool around with?
s09_e20_c01_u024	(with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!
s09_e20_c01_u025	(giggling and whispering) Maybe.
s09_e20_c01_u026	(whispering) You can't!
s09_e20_c01_u027	(whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with "because") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
s09_e20_c01_u028	In the hall.
s09_e20_c02_u029	You wanna fool around with Joey?
s09_e20_c02_u030	Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
s09_e20_c02_u031	Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
s09_e20_c02_u032	Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
s09_e20_c02_u033	Who, who are they?
s09_e20_c02_u034	I know them from work.
s09_e20_c02_u035	Both of them?
s09_e20_c02_u036	No, one of them...
s09_e20_c02_u037	Which one?
s09_e20_c02_u038	I don't know, what were the names I just said?
s09_e20_c02_u039	Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
s09_e20_c02_u040	All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)
s09_e20_c02_u041	What the hell are you cooking!
s09_e20_c03_u042	Hey!
s09_e20_c03_u043	Hey!
s09_e20_c03_u044	Hey!
s09_e20_c03_u045	Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
s09_e20_c03_u046	Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
s09_e20_c03_u047	(covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
s09_e20_c03_u048	What's so bad about that?
s09_e20_c03_u049	It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
s09_e20_c03_u050	(fingering her elbow): Ross?
s09_e20_c03_u051	(looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede.
s09_e20_c03_u052	(to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
s09_e20_c03_u053	No.
s09_e20_c03_u054	Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.
s09_e20_c03_u055	Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
s09_e20_c03_u056	Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.
s09_e20_c03_u057	It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
s09_e20_c03_u058	Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.
s09_e20_c03_u059	(to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?
s09_e20_c03_u060	(to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
s09_e20_c03_u061	And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
s09_e20_c03_u062	Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.
s09_e20_c03_u063	(to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
s09_e20_c03_u064	(hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
s09_e20_c03_u065	Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
s09_e20_c03_u066	I don't think so.
s09_e20_c03_u067	I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
s09_e20_c03_u068	Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?
s09_e20_c03_u069	You don't think we should wait for him?
s09_e20_c03_u070	You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?
s09_e20_c03_u071	Professor Geller?
s09_e20_c03_u072	Oh, damn it!
s09_e20_c04_u073	(from the answering machine) Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.
s09_e20_c04_u074	(entering the room) Hey!
s09_e20_c04_u075	Hey!
s09_e20_c04_u076	What's happenin'?
s09_e20_c04_u077	Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
s09_e20_c04_u078	Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
s09_e20_c04_u079	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)
s09_e20_c04_u080	"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight" (Joey's upset and stops it)
s09_e20_c04_u081	(yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!
s09_e20_c04_u082	(angry) You are having a party tonight??
s09_e20_c04_u083	Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
s09_e20_c04_u084	And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
s09_e20_c04_u085	I do it every year.
s09_e20_c04_u086	You do that every year??
s09_e20_c04_u087	I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
s09_e20_c04_u088	Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
s09_e20_c04_u089	Yeah...
s09_e20_c04_u090	And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
s09_e20_c04_u091	Yeah...
s09_e20_c04_u092	OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
s09_e20_c04_u093	(Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!
s09_e20_c04_u094	Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
s09_e20_c04_u095	You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
s09_e20_c04_u096	Well, then so you just invite me...!
s09_e20_c04_u097	(speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
s09_e20_c04_u098	Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
s09_e20_c04_u099	Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
s09_e20_c04_u100	(yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!
s09_e20_c05_u101	(speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
s09_e20_c05_u102	(very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
s09_e20_c05_u103	And that's not all I'm allergic to.
s09_e20_c05_u104	(to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!
s09_e20_c05_u105	I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...
s09_e20_c05_u106	So basically all nuts?
s09_e20_c05_u107	Interestingly... no.
s09_e20_c05_u108	Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".
s09_e20_c05_u109	If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away)
s09_e20_c05_u110	Oh my God!!
s09_e20_c05_u111	I've lost the will to live.
s09_e20_c05_u112	Let's ditch him!
s09_e20_c05_u113	What?
s09_e20_c05_u114	Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
s09_e20_c05_u115	Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
s09_e20_c05_u116	Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside)
s09_e20_c06_u117	(entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.
s09_e20_c06_u118	Hi!
s09_e20_c06_u119	Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
s09_e20_c06_u120	Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
s09_e20_c06_u121	Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...
s09_e20_c06_u122	Ah, ah.
s09_e20_c06_u123	(her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment)
s09_e20_c06_u124	(to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?
s09_e20_c06_u125	Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
s09_e20_c06_u126	(to Ross) So, did you two have fun?
s09_e20_c06_u127	Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...
s09_e20_c06_u128	And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!
s09_e20_c06_u129	(she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
s09_e20_c06_u130	Really? Wh-what's wrong?
s09_e20_c06_u131	I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
s09_e20_c06_u132	Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.
s09_e20_c06_u133	... Ok, who is this?
s09_e20_c06_u134	I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.
s09_e20_c06_u135	Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
s09_e20_c06_u136	Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
s09_e20_c06_u137	Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...
s09_e20_c06_u138	You're not sick!
s09_e20_c06_u139	What? Yes, I am!
s09_e20_c06_u140	Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??
s09_e20_c06_u141	When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)
s09_e20_c06_u142	You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
s09_e20_c06_u143	Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
s09_e20_c06_u144	Ok, what is this?
s09_e20_c06_u145	Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
s09_e20_c06_u146	(aloud) WHAT?
s09_e20_c06_u147	(looking at them) Wh-what's going on?
s09_e20_c06_u148	Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
s09_e20_c06_u149	And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
s09_e20_c06_u150	I thought you came to say you were sick.
s09_e20_c06_u151	Ok professor or detective?
s09_e20_c06_u152	Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
s09_e20_c06_u153	Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
s09_e20_c06_u154	And that horrible museum tour!
s09_e20_c06_u155	No, I arranged that...
s09_e20_c06_u156	(sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
s09_e20_c06_u157	We know about your party Joey.
s09_e20_c06_u158	What party?
s09_e20_c06_u159	The game's over! Take off your robe!
s09_e20_c06_u160	(looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...
s09_e20_c06_u161	No!! Cover it up!!
s09_e20_c06_u162	(to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)
s09_e20_c07_u163	(To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.
s09_e20_c07_u164	Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
s09_e20_c07_u165	(to Monica) Hi. (walks on)
s09_e20_c07_u166	(Yells after him) I love you!
s09_e20_c07_u167	Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
s09_e20_c07_u168	Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
s09_e20_c07_u169	Hey!
s09_e20_c07_u170	(Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
s09_e20_c07_u171	Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)
s09_e20_c07_u172	(Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!
s09_e20_c08_u173	Where the hell is everybody?
s09_e20_c08_u174	(yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
s09_e20_c09_u175	(to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".
s09_e20_c09_u176	Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
s09_e20_c09_u177	Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
s09_e20_c09_u178	It was nice to meet you Rachel.
s09_e20_c09_u179	Nice to meet you.
s09_e20_c09_u180	Call me.
s09_e20_c09_u181	Ok
s09_e20_c09_u182	(yelling after him) We will!!
s09_e20_c09_u183	(to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!
s09_e20_c09_u184	Yeah!
s09_e20_c09_u185	I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
s09_e20_c09_u186	Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
s09_e20_c09_u187	Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)
s09_e20_c09_u188	(to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
s09_e20_c09_u189	Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.
s09_e20_c09_u190	Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
s09_e20_c09_u191	Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
s09_e20_c09_u192	You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
s09_e20_c09_u193	Yeah...
s09_e20_c09_u194	... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
s09_e20_c09_u195	Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
s09_e20_c09_u196	Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
s09_e20_c09_u197	Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
s09_e20_c09_u198	(very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
s09_e20_c09_u199	Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
s09_e20_c09_u200	Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
s09_e20_c09_u201	A guy who won two.
s09_e20_c09_u202	(a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
s09_e20_c09_u203	Yeah... for three years.
s09_e20_c09_u204	Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
s09_e20_c09_u205	(smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
s09_e20_c09_u206	Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
s09_e20_c09_u207	No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
s09_e20_c09_u208	Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
s09_e20_c09_u209	Hey Ross!
s09_e20_c09_u210	How is it going with Charlie?
s09_e20_c09_u211	(sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
s09_e20_c09_u212	Oh, What's the matter?
s09_e20_c09_u213	She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
s09_e20_c09_u214	I always loved that!!
s09_e20_c09_u215	Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
s09_e20_c09_u216	Worse?
s09_e20_c09_u217	Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?
s09_e20_c09_u218	(still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
s09_e20_c09_u219	What? (turns around to look at Rachel)
s09_e20_c09_u220	Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)
s09_e20_c10_u221	Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?
s09_e20_c10_u222	(To himself) oh yes, God yes!!
s09_e20_c10_u223	(now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder) How could he leave me?!?!
s09_e20_c10_u224	I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
s09_e20_c11_u225	Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)
s09_e20_c11_u226	Nice to meet you.
s09_e20_c11_u227	Hey! So what show are you on?
s09_e20_c11_u228	Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
s09_e20_c11_u229	It's a science.
s09_e20_c11_u230	Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
s09_e20_c11_u231	Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
s09_e20_c11_u232	Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
s09_e20_c11_u233	Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
s09_e20_c11_u234	I'd lead with that.
s09_e20_c11_u235	That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).
s09_e20_c11_u236	Monica!
s09_e20_c11_u237	Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
s09_e20_c11_u238	(To Rachel) What have you got there?
s09_e20_c11_u239	Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
s09_e20_c11_u240	Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
s09_e20_c11_u241	(drunken voice) I think I am.
s09_e20_c11_u242	(browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
s09_e20_c11_u243	(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
s09_e20_c11_u244	(picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
s09_e20_c11_u245	Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
s09_e20_c11_u246	Joey, you're so sweet.
s09_e20_c11_u247	That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
s09_e20_c11_u248	Who (looks around)?
s09_e20_c11_u249	Me.
s09_e20_c11_u250	(surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?
s09_e20_c11_u251	Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!
s09_e20_c11_u252	Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)
s09_e20_c11_u253	Gotcha.
s09_e20_c11_u254	Oh, Very funny... Joey.
s09_e20_c11_u255	(to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?
s09_e20_c11_u256	Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
s09_e20_c11_u257	Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
s09_e20_c11_u258	You really liked it?
s09_e20_c11_u259	Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
s09_e20_c11_u260	Oh really!
s09_e20_c11_u261	Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
s09_e20_c11_u262	No!
s09_e20_c11_u263	Did somebody sign your bra?
s09_e20_c11_u264	So I got it when I was 13...
s09_e20_c12_u265	Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?
s09_e20_c12_u266	It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
s09_e20_c12_u267	Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.
s09_e20_c12_u268	Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
s09_e20_c12_u269	You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...
s09_e20_c12_u270	And sexy.
s09_e20_c12_u271	Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
s09_e20_c12_u272	Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
s09_e20_c12_u273	Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
s09_e20_c12_u274	Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
s09_e20_c12_u275	(to Monica) Hey!
s09_e20_c12_u276	Hey!
s09_e20_c12_u277	I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
s09_e20_c12_u278	No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
s09_e20_c12_u279	Please, what about you and Chandler?
s09_e20_c12_u280	That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
s09_e20_c12_u281	Well hello (points to herself)!
s09_e20_c12_u282	What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
s09_e20_c12_u283	I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
s09_e20_c12_u284	Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
s09_e20_c12_u285	(pause) I'm gonna do it.
s09_e20_c12_u286	And I can't stop you.
s09_e20_c12_u287	No.
s09_e20_c12_u288	(to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
s09_e20_c12_u289	I'm smarter than him!
s09_e20_c13_u290	Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
s09_e20_c13_u291	Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
s09_e20_c13_u292	Oh, you're so wonderful.
s09_e20_c13_u293	Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
s09_e20_c13_u294	Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).
s08_e09_c01_u001	Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
s08_e09_c01_u002	(looking at her fingers) Oh my-God! Let me see that! (Grabs the book from him.)
s08_e09_c01_u003	(laughing) You fall for it every time!
s08_e09_c01_u004	(entering) Hey!
s08_e09_c01_u005	Hi!
s08_e09_c01_u006	I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)
s08_e09_c01_u007	Oh Pheebs that's so sweet-(Grabs a pair of pants)-Ooh, those are so cute!
s08_e09_c01_u008	Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows? (There's a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.
s08_e09_c01_u009	(entering) Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
s08_e09_c01_u010	No.
s08_e09_c01_u011	He was in Ross's class-marching band-kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
s08_e09_c01_u012	Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
s08_e09_c01_u013	No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time- (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.
s08_e09_c01_u014	Oh that's nice.
s08_e09_c01_u015	Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still love Chandler.
s08_e09_c01_u016	I just want you to say it once in a while.
s08_e09_c01_u017	All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.
s08_e09_c01_u018	What?!
s08_e09_c01_u019	Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey
s08_e09_c01_u020	Phoebe!
s08_e09_c01_u021	Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!
s08_e09_c01_u022	No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
s08_e09_c01_u023	All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.
s08_e09_c01_u024	She is?
s08_e09_c01_u025	Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
s08_e09_c01_u026	Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
s08_e09_c01_u027	Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.
s08_e09_c01_u028	But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
s08_e09_c01_u029	All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be a ton left over.
s08_e09_c01_u030	No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!
s08_e09_c01_u031	All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
s08_e09_c01_u032	That's right! Cause I'm a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
s08_e09_c02_u033	Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing him) Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!
s08_e09_c02_u034	(entering) Hey!
s08_e09_c02_u035	Hey!
s08_e09_c02_u036	Happy Thanksgiving!
s08_e09_c02_u037	You too!
s08_e09_c02_u038	Anything I can do to help?
s08_e09_c02_u039	Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)
s08_e09_c02_u040	Sure!
s08_e09_c02_u041	I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
s08_e09_c02_u042	Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)
s08_e09_c02_u043	No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We're not at a barn dance. You've gotta-you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?
s08_e09_c02_u044	Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So how's the game?
s08_e09_c02_u045	I have no idea.
s08_e09_c02_u046	What?
s08_e09_c02_u047	Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
s08_e09_c02_u048	I don't believe you! That is-brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
s08_e09_c02_u049	Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
s08_e09_c02_u050	Is your team winning hon?
s08_e09_c02_u051	Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There's no Anderson.
s08_e09_c02_u052	Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on.
s08_e09_c02_u053	Oh, I didn't know you liked football.
s08_e09_c02_u054	Well normally I don't, but y'know-(looks at the TV)-Green Bay is playing.
s08_e09_c02_u055	You like Green Bay?
s08_e09_c02_u056	Well it's only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
s08_e09_c02_u057	Hey!
s08_e09_c02_u058	Hey!
s08_e09_c02_u059	Happy Thanksgiving!
s08_e09_c02_u060	Aww thanks! God Will I'm so glad that you came! You look great! You must've lost like
s08_e09_c02_u061	150 pounds. Yeah, I'm gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
s08_e09_c02_u062	A pie! (Will brought a pie.)
s08_e09_c02_u063	Oh right. All right, it's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy-it's no good. Throw it out.
s08_e09_c02_u064	You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
s08_e09_c02_u065	Hey.
s08_e09_c02_u066	Oh hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other.
s08_e09_c02_u067	This is Phoebe.
s08_e09_c02_u068	(nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well done.
s08_e09_c02_u069	(to Will) Wanna give me a hand?
s08_e09_c02_u070	Sure! Monica, I can't get over how great you look! You look stunning!
s08_e09_c02_u071	Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!
s08_e09_c02_u072	I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!
s08_e09_c02_u073	Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
s08_e09_c02_u074	Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
s08_e09_c02_u075	Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)
s08_e09_c02_u076	Oh.
s08_e09_c02_u077	Is there a problem?
s08_e09_c02_u078	Nope. Uh, it's okay. It's just uh, God I hated her.
s08_e09_c02_u079	What?
s08_e09_c02_u080	Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I'm in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? (Starts looking.) No Will no!
s08_e09_c02_u081	(To Phoebe) Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should.
s08_e09_c02_u082	Oh okay.
s08_e09_c02_u083	Oh come on!
s08_e09_c02_u084	Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
s08_e09_c02_u085	Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.
s08_e09_c02_u086	Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
s08_e09_c02_u087	All right.
s08_e09_c02_u088	Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
s08_e09_c02_u089	I actually know what you're talking about. I'm here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.
s08_e09_c02_u090	(To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?
s08_e09_c02_u091	Will! From high school.
s08_e09_c02_u092	Oh hey!
s08_e09_c02_u093	(to Will) Joey.
s08_e09_c02_u094	Hello.
s08_e09_c02_u095	(entering) Will!
s08_e09_c02_u096	Ross!
s08_e09_c02_u097	Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?
s08_e09_c02_u098	It's good to see you man.
s08_e09_c02_u099	Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?
s08_e09_c02_u100	I'm a commodities broker.
s08_e09_c02_u101	Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
s08_e09_c02_u102	Yeah, it's not. But I'm rich and thin.
s08_e09_c02_u103	Oh! Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party.
s08_e09_c02_u104	That was such a fun night!
s08_e09_c02_u105	Yeah. It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
s08_e09_c02_u106	Yeah.
s08_e09_c02_u107	Yeah.
s08_e09_c02_u108	God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
s08_e09_c02_u109	(laughs) Yeah.
s08_e09_c02_u110	So what do you, what do you do now?
s08_e09_c02_u111	So how long are you in town?
s08_e09_c02_u112	(entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi!
s08_e09_c02_u113	Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)
s08_e09_c02_u114	(glaring at Rachel) Rachel Green.
s08_e09_c02_u115	Aw-oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
s08_e09_c02_u116	Oh, I'll-I'll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!
s08_e09_c02_u117	Will, high school was-was a long time ago.
s08_e09_c02_u118	Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross: Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.
s08_e09_c02_u119	(sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?
s08_e09_c02_u120	That's Will from high school!
s08_e09_c02_u121	Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he's- Look at the way he's just staring at me. I think he's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out. (Will mouths, "I hate you.")
s08_e09_c02_u122	Okay, dinner's ready!
s08_e09_c02_u123	Good game!
s08_e09_c02_u124	Yeah.
s08_e09_c02_u125	Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
s08_e09_c02_u126	Oh, so who won?
s08_e09_c02_u127	(simultaneously) Green Bay.
s08_e09_c02_u128	(simultaneously) Detroit.
s08_e09_c02_u129	What?
s08_e09_c02_u130	Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay-Mermen.
s08_e09_c02_u131	Hi! Will, right?
s08_e09_c02_u132	Right.
s08_e09_c02_u133	Hi! I'm Rachel Green.
s08_e09_c02_u134	Oh I-I remember you.
s08_e09_c02_u135	Really?! Aren't you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?
s08_e09_c02_u136	You are unbelievable.
s08_e09_c02_u137	Thank you!
s08_e09_c02_u138	(breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don't you sit here? (Next to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)
s08_e09_c02_u139	That's it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
s08_e09_c02_u140	(laughs) This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down a huge turkey.)
s08_e09_c02_u141	(quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?
s08_e09_c02_u142	About nineteen pounds.
s08_e09_c02_u143	(To Rachel) It's like me when I was born.
s08_e09_c02_u144	All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
s08_e09_c02_u145	Oh, you'd like that wouldn't ya?
s08_e09_c02_u146	What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh y'know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
s08_e09_c02_u147	(sneeze talks) Typical.
s08_e09_c02_u148	I'm sorry. What?
s08_e09_c02_u149	I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land. (Does a fake hair flip.)
s08_e09_c02_u150	(To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?
s08_e09_c02_u151	Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
s08_e09_c02_u152	I don't know? Do I? Do I?
s08_e09_c02_u153	I think you do.
s08_e09_c02_u154	(To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
s08_e09_c02_u155	A little mean? You made my life miserable!
s08_e09_c02_u156	I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I
s08_e09_c02_u157	Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!
s08_e09_c02_u158	Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard
s08_e09_c02_u159	Yams!!!!
s08_e09_c02_u160	Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who starts dishing out a large helping.)
s08_e09_c02_u161	Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I'm real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school
s08_e09_c02_u162	Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club!
s08_e09_c02_u163	You had a club?!
s08_e09_c02_u164	That's right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
s08_e09_c02_u165	Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
s08_e09_c02_u166	Me and Ross. (Points at Ross.)
s08_e09_c02_u167	No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
s08_e09_c03_u168	(To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
s08_e09_c03_u169	Yes he was. (Holds up his hand for a high-five.)
s08_e09_c03_u170	No. No.
s08_e09_c03_u171	So who else was in this club?
s08_e09_c03_u172	Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don't think he-he knew what it was.
s08_e09_c03_u173	So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
s08_e09_c03_u174	You went out with her?! We had a pact!
s08_e09_c03_u175	That was in high school! It's not like it was binding forever.
s08_e09_c03_u176	Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
s08_e09_c03_u177	Okay Monica, did you know about this?!
s08_e09_c03_u178	I swear I didn't. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
s08_e09_c03_u179	Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
s08_e09_c03_u180	Look Rach I-I'm sorry, okay? I-I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined
s08_e09_c03_u181	Co-founded!
s08_e09_c03_u182	co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
s08_e09_c03_u183	Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
s08_e09_c03_u184	Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
s08_e09_c03_u185	Well, we did a little more than that.
s08_e09_c03_u186	No-no! No-no. No-no.
s08_e09_c03_u187	What?! What else did you do?
s08_e09_c03_u188	We started a rumor.
s08_e09_c03_u189	What rumor?
s08_e09_c03_u190	Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
s08_e09_c03_u191	Ross!
s08_e09_c03_u192	It was no big deal. We-we-said that the rumor was-that umm-you had both-male and female reproductive parts.
s08_e09_c03_u193	What?!
s08_e09_c03_u194	That's right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
s08_e09_c03_u195	(shocked) Oh my God!
s08_e09_c03_u196	You started that?!
s08_e09_c03_u197	What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)
s08_e09_c03_u198	Everyone at our school heard it!
s08_e09_c03_u199	Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
s08_e09_c03_u200	Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)
s08_e09_c03_u201	Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one's not really our fault.
s08_e09_c03_u202	Monica, how come you never told me this?!
s08_e09_c03_u203	I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
s08_e09_c03_u204	Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
s08_e09_c03_u205	I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
s08_e09_c03_u206	Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)
s08_e09_c03_u207	You are my Everest.
s08_e09_c03_u208	Joey, you don't have to finish that.
s08_e09_c03_u209	Oh yes I do. Otherwise what's next? Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just-I just-I gotta change my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)
s08_e09_c03_u210	(entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you're such a good person." Not girl! Person!
s08_e09_c03_u211	Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it.
s08_e09_c03_u212	(reading what he wrote again) "Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." (Will laughs.)
s08_e09_c03_u213	Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn't true?!
s08_e09_c03_u214	Yes!
s08_e09_c03_u215	Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
s08_e09_c03_u216	Oh! Me too!
s08_e09_c03_u217	Well look-look I'm not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
s08_e09_c03_u218	I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y'know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
s08_e09_c03_u219	That's not totally true.
s08_e09_c03_u220	What?
s08_e09_c03_u221	What?
s08_e09_c03_u222	Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
s08_e09_c03_u223	(shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!
s08_e09_c03_u224	It's true?!!
s08_e09_c03_u225	No.
s08_e09_c03_u226	Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
s08_e09_c03_u227	Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.
s08_e09_c03_u228	I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
s08_e09_c03_u229	Hey! She didn't look 50!
s08_e09_c03_u230	Did she look 16?
s08_e09_c03_u231	Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
s08_e09_c03_u232	Oh! (They all look.) Wow!
s08_e09_c03_u233	She didn't photograph well!
s08_e09_c03_u234	Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
s08_e09_c03_u235	So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
s08_e09_c03_u236	I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace
s08_e09_c03_u237	Didn't she walk with a cane?
s08_e09_c03_u238	Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what? (To Will) I'm back in the club!
s08_e09_c03_u239	Yeah! (They high-five.)
s08_e09_c03_u240	I wanna join!
s08_e09_c03_u241	Wh-Phoebe!!
s08_e09_c03_u242	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn't go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
s08_e09_c03_u243	All right, y'know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)
s08_e09_c03_u244	All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
s08_e09_c03_u245	Wow
s08_e09_c03_u246	And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
s08_e09_c03_u247	As a romancer of the elderly.
s08_e09_c03_u248	Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
s08_e09_c03_u249	The eyes-did still sparkle.
s08_e09_c03_u250	Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can't you just let this go?
s08_e09_c03_u251	She's right.
s08_e09_c03_u252	Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
s08_e09_c03_u253	Hold on! You got her pregnant?
s08_e09_c03_u254	Yeah.
s08_e09_c03_u255	Are ya getting married?
s08_e09_c03_u256	Nope.
s08_e09_c03_u257	So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude! (Wants another high-five and Ross ignores him.) Anybody?
s08_e09_c03_u258	Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
s08_e09_c03_u259	(entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right where's that turkey!
s08_e09_c03_u260	Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
s08_e09_c03_u261	Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
s08_e09_c04_u262	Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)
s08_e09_c04_u263	Well Joey, we're all-we're all very proud of you.
s08_e09_c04_u264	Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
s08_e09_c04_u265	Is there anything we can do for you?
s08_e09_c04_u266	No just, nobody press on my stomach.
s08_e09_c04_u267	You can keep those pants by the way.
s08_e09_c04_u268	Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
s08_e09_c04_u269	Yeah, you want some?
s08_e09_c04_u270	Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.) A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the knife again.) What?! Are you afraid you're gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
s08_e06_c01_u001	Hey you guys?
s08_e06_c01_u002	What?
s08_e06_c01_u003	I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
s08_e06_c01_u004	Oh good! (And there's general excitement.)
s08_e06_c01_u005	And everybody has to wear costumes. (And there's general disconcertment.) Come on! It'll be fun!
s08_e06_c01_u006	Well, I'll-I'll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so
s08_e06_c01_u007	Please tell me you're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
s08_e06_c01_u008	(exhales sarcastically) Not two years in a row.
s08_e06_c01_u009	Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up.
s08_e06_c01_u010	You have to!
s08_e06_c01_u011	No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not
s08_e06_c01_u012	You're an actor!
s08_e06_c01_u013	So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
s08_e06_c01_u014	Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
s08_e06_c01_u015	That hot girl from their wedding?
s08_e06_c01_u016	Yeah.
s08_e06_c01_u017	Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh-Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
s08_e06_c01_u018	Now wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
s08_e06_c01_u019	That's right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won. (To Joey) Please don't take her from me.
s08_e06_c02_u020	Ursula! (Ursula turns, smiles, and continues walking.) Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!
s08_e06_c02_u021	Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye. (Starts to walk again.)
s08_e06_c02_u022	Wait a second! So, what's new with you?
s08_e06_c02_u023	Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.
s08_e06_c02_u024	What?!
s08_e06_c02_u025	Yeah! Yeah, it's gonna be a small ceremony. Just family. (Phoebe looks at her.) His.
s08_e06_c02_u026	Huh. Okay. Well, I'm really happy for you. (Starts to walk away.)
s08_e06_c02_u027	Wait! If umm, if you want to come, I guess that'd be okay.
s08_e06_c02_u028	Really?
s08_e06_c02_u029	Sure! Why not? You could be my sister for the day.
s08_e06_c02_u030	Yeah. Okay. Umm, y'know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you're marrying.
s08_e06_c02_u031	Huh. Well, I'm supposed to be working at the restaurant tonight. I'm supposed to be working right now, so who cares.
s08_e06_c02_u032	By the way, it's a costume party.
s08_e06_c02_u033	Oh! Okay, so that's why you're- (Motions to what she's wearing.)
s08_e06_c02_u034	(looks down) No. But thanks. (Walks away.)
s08_e06_c03_u035	Hi!
s08_e06_c03_u036	Wait! You're supposed to wear a costume!
s08_e06_c03_u037	I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won't be able to fit into it.
s08_e06_c03_u038	Oh.
s08_e06_c03_u039	Ahh!
s08_e06_c03_u040	I'm Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it.
s08_e06_c03_u041	Okay.
s08_e06_c03_u042	Trick or treat!
s08_e06_c03_u043	Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y'know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.
s08_e06_c03_u044	Trick or treat!!
s08_e06_c03_u045	(to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. (Gives her candy.)
s08_e06_c03_u046	And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)
s08_e06_c03_u047	(to the cowgirl) And you are so in style right now. Y'know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don't suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but
s08_e06_c03_u048	(interrupting) Can I just have the candy?
s08_e06_c03_u049	Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe, dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)
s08_e06_c03_u050	Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
s08_e06_c03_u051	So we do Supergirl.
s08_e06_c03_u052	No, it's me. Phoebe!
s08_e06_c03_u053	(entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume
s08_e06_c03_u054	(To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?
s08_e06_c03_u055	What?! I thought he'd love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
s08_e06_c03_u056	The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
s08_e06_c03_u057	Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
s08_e06_c03_u058	No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
s08_e06_c03_u059	(entering) Hey!
s08_e06_c03_u060	You didn't dress up either?!
s08_e06_c03_u061	Yes I did! I'm Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?
s08_e06_c03_u062	How is that me?
s08_e06_c03_u063	Okay. I'm Chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.)
s08_e06_c03_u064	(To Chandler) That is so you!
s08_e06_c03_u065	When have I ever done that?!
s08_e06_c03_u066	When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.)
s08_e06_c03_u067	Trick or treat!
s08_e06_c03_u068	Oh! (Opens the door to reveal a ballerina) Well you're just the prettiest ballerina I've ever seen.
s08_e06_c03_u069	Thank you. (Pirouettes.)
s08_e06_c03_u070	Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
s08_e06_c03_u071	Thank you. (Does another ballerina move.)
s08_e06_c03_u072	Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
s08_e06_c03_u073	I love you! (Hugs Rachel.)
s08_e06_c03_u074	Ohh- Oh, honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?
s08_e06_c03_u075	What?! There's only been like four kids.
s08_e06_c03_u076	Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.
s08_e06_c03_u077	No wonder your pregnant.
s08_e06_c03_u078	(entering) Hey! (He's wearing a costume as well.)
s08_e06_c03_u079	Hey.
s08_e06_c03_u080	What are you supposed to be?
s08_e06_c03_u081	Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well, I'm a potato or a-spud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with an old TV antenna glued on top that he's wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes- (They're still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!
s08_e06_c03_u082	Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore!
s08_e06_c03_u083	(sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
s08_e06_c03_u084	No, I-I'm not doody.
s08_e06_c03_u085	No, space doody!
s08_e06_c03_u086	Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?
s08_e06_c03_u087	Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
s08_e06_c03_u088	Ursula?
s08_e06_c03_u089	Ursula's fiancee?
s08_e06_c03_u090	Oh my God, you're the sister!
s08_e06_c03_u091	Yeah.
s08_e06_c03_u092	Okay, I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
s08_e06_c03_u093	Yeah.
s08_e06_c03_u094	I'm an idiot. Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.
s08_e06_c03_u095	My mother killed herself.
s08_e06_c03_u096	She, now I knew that and-now I'm sweating. Look at me, I'm really sweating-Now I'm saying, "Look at me," I'm getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.
s08_e06_c03_u097	No-no! That's okay, we'll just start over. Okay? Hi! I'm Phoebe.
s08_e06_c03_u098	Eric. (They shake hands and he's squinting. And, no, it's not me.)
s08_e06_c03_u099	Why are you looking at me like that?
s08_e06_c03_u100	Cause the sweat's getting in my eyes and its burning.
s08_e06_c03_u101	Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So, what are you?
s08_e06_c03_u102	I don't think they have a name for it. It's just I get nervous; I start sweating like crazy.
s08_e06_c03_u103	(laughs) No I-I meant your costume.
s08_e06_c03_u104	Oh umm, I'm the solar system. (He's wearing a black sweater with the planets glued on around the sun.) Yeah, my students helped me make it-I teach the second grade.
s08_e06_c03_u105	I love the second grade!
s08_e06_c03_u106	Really?
s08_e06_c03_u107	Yeah! It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade. Y'know with all the politics and mind games.
s08_e06_c03_u108	So what do you do?
s08_e06_c03_u109	Umm, I'm a masseuse-by day. (Stands with her hands on her hips like a Supergirl pose.)
s08_e06_c03_u110	Y'know you don't have to stand here with me, believe me
s08_e06_c03_u111	No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.
s08_e06_c03_u112	Oh I feel very lucky, she's great. I think she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
s08_e06_c03_u113	Thank you.
s08_e06_c03_u114	Hey Joey?
s08_e06_c03_u115	Yeah.
s08_e06_c03_u116	You read comic books right?
s08_e06_c03_u117	Exclusively.
s08_e06_c03_u118	Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
s08_e06_c03_u119	Catwoman, hands down.
s08_e06_c03_u120	Yeah
s08_e06_c03_u121	But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe.
s08_e06_c03_u122	What?! Really?!
s08_e06_c03_u123	Are you kiddin'? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She-She's not standing right behind me is she?
s08_e06_c03_u124	No you're fine. (Joey checks anyway.) All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?
s08_e06_c03_u125	I'm not sure.
s08_e06_c03_u126	What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as you can!
s08_e06_c03_u127	Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
s08_e06_c03_u128	Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y'know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
s08_e06_c03_u129	I would say, "Woman, please!"
s08_e06_c03_u130	(walking over) Hey. Ursula's fiancee is really sweet! He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y'know normally y'know, I don't like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
s08_e06_c03_u131	Oh my God, Phoebe!
s08_e06_c03_u132	What?
s08_e06_c03_u133	You're getting a crush on your sister's fiancee.
s08_e06_c03_u134	No I'm not! You are!
s08_e06_c03_u135	(To Monica) Here comes the temper.
s08_e06_c03_u136	Trick or treat!
s08_e06_c03_u137	Hi! Y'know what honey, we're actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I'm out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?
s08_e06_c03_u138	Okay!
s08_e06_c03_u139	Okay, what's your name?
s08_e06_c03_u140	Lelani Mayolanofavich.
s08_e06_c03_u141	Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to cash.
s08_e06_c03_u142	(entering) Hi!
s08_e06_c03_u143	Hey Mona!
s08_e06_c03_u144	Oh! Hi!
s08_e06_c03_u145	Hi!
s08_e06_c03_u146	Joey's gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you'd come by as a slutty nurse.
s08_e06_c03_u147	Umm, actually I'm just a nurse.
s08_e06_c03_u148	You'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out.
s08_e06_c03_u149	Hey!
s08_e06_c03_u150	Hi!
s08_e06_c03_u151	You made it!
s08_e06_c03_u152	Wait-wait! You're umm, you're a potato
s08_e06_c03_u153	Well, I'm a spud
s08_e06_c03_u154	And the antennae-Oh my God you're Spudnik!
s08_e06_c03_u155	Yes!
s08_e06_c03_u156	(To Ross) Marry her.
s08_e06_c03_u157	Okay, here's a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.
s08_e06_c03_u158	I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.
s08_e06_c03_u159	So Ross?
s08_e06_c03_u160	Yeah.
s08_e06_c03_u161	Hey beautiful.
s08_e06_c03_u162	Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
s08_e06_c03_u163	Two weeks ago.
s08_e06_c03_u164	Two weeks? That's it?
s08_e06_c03_u165	Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and it's not like me to do something so impulsive, but she's just so perfect, and we have so much in common.
s08_e06_c03_u166	Oh really?
s08_e06_c03_u167	We're both teachers.
s08_e06_c03_u168	Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)
s08_e06_c03_u169	And we were both in the Peace Corps.
s08_e06_c03_u170	Peace Corps, really? (Ursula motions, "I don't know.")
s08_e06_c03_u171	In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.
s08_e06_c03_u172	Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left. (To Eric) Shall we get me really drunk?
s08_e06_c03_u173	Sure.
s08_e06_c03_u174	Howdy doody.
s08_e06_c03_u175	That's funny. Yeah. Y'know you're the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
s08_e06_c03_u176	Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed.
s08_e06_c03_u177	(To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
s08_e06_c03_u178	What question?
s08_e06_c03_u179	Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
s08_e06_c03_u180	There's no question.
s08_e06_c03_u181	So you think Ross too?
s08_e06_c03_u182	(To Monica) You picked Ross?!
s08_e06_c03_u183	Ross is really strong! Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey.
s08_e06_c03_u184	I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
s08_e06_c03_u185	Uh, in her defense, she's right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
s08_e06_c03_u186	Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)
s08_e06_c03_u187	Oh I'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!
s08_e06_c03_u188	Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment.
s08_e06_c03_u189	Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to see a fight, let's give em what they came for!
s08_e06_c03_u190	Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.
s08_e06_c03_u191	Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
s08_e06_c03_u192	(To Ross) You're going down.
s08_e06_c03_u193	Oh yeah? You're going further down! Downtown!
s08_e06_c03_u194	Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
s08_e06_c04_u195	Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
s08_e06_c04_u196	Really?
s08_e06_c04_u197	Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
s08_e06_c04_u198	Trick or treat!
s08_e06_c04_u199	Gotta go! (Opens the door to a boy in a cape.) Hi! Wow! There you go! (Hands him some candy.)
s08_e06_c04_u200	My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
s08_e06_c04_u201	Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy.
s08_e06_c04_u202	I'd rather have the money.
s08_e06_c04_u203	Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
s08_e06_c04_u204	This isn't fair.
s08_e06_c04_u205	Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
s08_e06_c04_u206	Shut up!
s08_e06_c04_u207	You shut up!
s08_e06_c04_u208	You can't tell me to shut up!
s08_e06_c04_u209	Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
s08_e06_c04_u210	Rach?
s08_e06_c04_u211	(To Joey) Yeah I know-I'm good-I got it! (Joey slowly backs away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute, I've got one more thing I have to say to you-oh right! Shut up!
s08_e06_c04_u212	You're a mean old woman. (Runs away.)
s08_e06_c04_u213	No! Wait no! Shut up-I mean don't cry! Let me get my checkbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)
s08_e06_c04_u214	(To Chandler) Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
s08_e06_c04_u215	That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
s08_e06_c05_u216	Hi liar!
s08_e06_c05_u217	Hey!
s08_e06_c05_u218	Y'know the only reason he's marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
s08_e06_c05_u219	Well they could be true.
s08_e06_c05_u220	But they're not!
s08_e06_c05_u221	Yeah, it's a fine line huh?
s08_e06_c05_u222	Why are you lying to him?
s08_e06_c05_u223	I don't know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.
s08_e06_c05_u224	(entering) Honey?
s08_e06_c05_u225	(waving the cigarette in Phoebe's face) It's a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
s08_e06_c05_u226	She's helped so many people to quit smoking.
s08_e06_c05_u227	Y'know, we'd really better get going.
s08_e06_c05_u228	Oh right, you've got a church group meeting tonight.
s08_e06_c05_u229	Right. (Walks down the stairs.)
s08_e06_c05_u230	(To Phoebe) Well, it was nice meeting you.
s08_e06_c05_u231	You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
s08_e06_c05_u232	(entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! (They go inside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. (They grasp each other's hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
s08_e06_c05_u233	Pride.
s08_e06_c05_u234	And dignity.
s08_e06_c05_u235	(laughing) Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
s08_e06_c05_u236	(To Joey) Wow! They're both really strong.
s08_e06_c05_u237	Or equally weak.
s08_e06_c05_u238	(To Phoebe) Oh God!
s08_e06_c05_u239	Hmm?
s08_e06_c05_u240	Chandler's making his sex face.
s08_e06_c05_u241	(To Chandler) So, you gettin' tired?
s08_e06_c05_u242	Nope! I can do this all day.
s08_e06_c05_u243	Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin' a little tired though.
s08_e06_c05_u244	God, I'm exhausted.
s08_e06_c05_u245	Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona's standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
s08_e06_c05_u246	No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
s08_e06_c05_u247	Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin' people up! And I'm dressed as doody.
s08_e06_c05_u248	You're Spudnik.
s08_e06_c05_u249	Come on, who are we kidding? I'm doody. Please? She's watchin'.
s08_e06_c05_u250	Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!
s08_e06_c05_u251	(celebrating) Oh yeah!
s08_e06_c05_u252	(clapping) Yay! My hero!
s08_e06_c05_u253	(to her) You're a weird lady.
s08_e06_c05_u254	(entering) Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
s08_e06_c05_u255	Oh.
s08_e06_c05_u256	(finds it) What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.
s08_e06_c05_u257	Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
s08_e06_c05_u258	Well, I guess I'll see you at the wedding. (Exits and Phoebe follows him into the hall.)
s08_e06_c05_u259	Umm listen, I don't think-I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
s08_e06_c05_u260	I think we'll be okay. Besides it's so perfect and (whispering) she's been saving herself for me.
s08_e06_c05_u261	Okay I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.
s08_e06_c05_u262	What?
s08_e06_c05_u263	She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs Ursula's purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. (Holds up her nametag.) Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
s08_e06_c05_u264	She told me she was 25.
s08_e06_c05_u265	Oh, I almost don't want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just remember I'm a minute younger.
s08_e06_c05_u266	I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She's not a teacher. There's not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.
s08_e06_c05_u267	No. You're not, you're not stupid.
s08_e06_c05_u268	I'm not smart. (Phoebe has no comeback.) I just wanted so much to-be impulsive once. To be romantic.
s08_e06_c05_u269	That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just-you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?
s08_e06_c05_u270	It's just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
s08_e06_c05_u271	(yelling from downstairs) Eric!! Let's go!!
s08_e06_c05_u272	I'd better go, deal
s08_e06_c05_u273	Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)
s08_e06_c05_u274	Hurry up I gotta pray!!
s08_e06_c05_u275	Hey!
s08_e06_c05_u276	Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
s08_e06_c05_u277	That's not so bad.
s08_e06_c05_u278	No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
s08_e06_c05_u279	Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
s08_e06_c05_u280	Really? You think that's all it is?
s08_e06_c05_u281	Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas-and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)
s08_e06_c06_u282	Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost.
s08_e06_c06_u283	Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
s08_e06_c06_u284	(laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.
s08_e06_c06_u285	No, I let him win-Ross!
s08_e06_c06_u286	Yeah?
s08_e06_c06_u287	Would you tell her I let you win please?
s08_e06_c06_u288	Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! (Waddles over to Mona.)
s08_e06_c06_u289	I am strong! I'll show you! (He sits down at the table.)
s08_e06_c06_u290	Chandler please!
s08_e06_c06_u291	Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
s08_e06_c06_u292	Let's go big bunny!
s08_e06_c06_u293	Okay. 1-2-3-Go! (Once again he's at a stalemate, but this time he's in pain.) (Pause) I'm gonna kill myself!
s10_e06_c09_u001	Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
s08_e08_c01_u001	(coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?
s08_e08_c01_u002	Huh?
s08_e08_c01_u003	I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
s08_e08_c01_u004	Sure. Yeah, he's kinda sexy.
s08_e08_c01_u005	Oh no, no, I'll be there too.
s08_e08_c01_u006	Okay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off.
s08_e08_c01_u007	No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
s08_e08_c01_u008	Oh. Why not?
s08_e08_c01_u009	Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
s08_e08_c01_u010	Oh Rachel, this is all so Papa don't preach.'
s08_e08_c01_u011	What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he'd make me eat the entire pack.
s08_e08_c01_u012	Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
s08_e08_c01_u013	Thank you.
s08_e08_c01_u014	Gosh. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They both sit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
s08_e08_c01_u015	(recognizing him and panicking) No you don't!
s08_e08_c01_u016	(panicking) No you don't.
s08_e08_c01_u017	Oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
s08_e08_c01_u018	Her what?!!
s08_e08_c01_u019	Your secret bachelorette party
s08_e08_c01_u020	You had a bachelorette party?!
s08_e08_c01_u021	She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!
s08_e08_c01_u022	I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
s08_e08_c01_u023	It's a grand tradition!
s08_e08_c01_u024	I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
s08_e08_c01_u025	Well you could've untied it with your hands.
s08_e08_c01_u026	This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
s08_e08_c01_u027	You went home with the waitress.
s08_e08_c01_u028	Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
s08_e08_c01_u029	I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
s08_e08_c01_u030	Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
s08_e08_c02_u031	How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
s08_e08_c02_u032	Oh, I-I don't eat meat.
s08_e08_c02_u033	It's chicken.
s08_e08_c02_u034	Yeah, I don't eat that either.
s08_e08_c02_u035	I'll never understand you lesbians. (To Rachel) So baby, tell me-what is new with you.
s08_e08_c02_u036	Well actually umm
s08_e08_c02_u037	(interrupting) Your '74 Lafite sir.
s08_e08_c02_u038	'74?! I ordered the '75! That's a magnificent wine! The '74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?! (The waiter's dumbfounded) Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?
s08_e08_c02_u039	This is why I told the manager I wouldn't wait on you tonight! (Runs off.)
s08_e08_c02_u040	Oh come on! Don't be such a baby! (Goes after him)
s08_e08_c02_u041	(To Phoebe) In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
s08_e08_c02_u042	He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss.
s08_e08_c02_u043	This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
s08_e08_c02_u044	Rachel!
s08_e08_c02_u045	No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
s08_e08_c02_u046	Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
s08_e08_c02_u047	Hey, that is the-baby's problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
s08_e08_c02_u048	I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.
s08_e08_c02_u049	Well- Umm, I got TiVo.
s08_e08_c02_u050	What's TiVo?
s08_e08_c02_u051	It's slang for pregnant.
s08_e08_c02_u052	Phoebe!
s08_e08_c02_u053	Are you really pregnant?
s08_e08_c02_u054	Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
s08_e08_c02_u055	Who is the father? Oh no! Please don't tell me it's her! (Points at Phoebe.)
s08_e08_c02_u056	No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes his head.) Oh daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You're gonna-This is your first grandchild! You're gonna be a poppy!
s08_e08_c02_u057	That's true.
s08_e08_c02_u058	Yeah.
s08_e08_c02_u059	(laughs) Poppy. (To Phoebe) Oh, I'm gonna be a poppy. (Stops laughing) So when is the wedding?
s08_e08_c02_u060	Who?
s08_e08_c02_u061	The wedding! There's going to be a wedding. Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! (Rachel pauses) Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!
s08_e08_c02_u062	February 2nd!
s08_e08_c03_u063	So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
s08_e08_c03_u064	Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
s08_e08_c03_u065	Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y'know take it all in.
s08_e08_c03_u066	Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
s08_e08_c03_u067	So, I gotta get going.
s08_e08_c03_u068	Okay, I-I'll see you tonight.
s08_e08_c03_u069	Yeah.
s08_e08_c03_u070	Okay, bye.
s08_e08_c03_u071	Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing! (She leaves.)
s08_e08_c03_u072	My God! You must be good in bed!
s08_e08_c03_u073	So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?
s08_e08_c03_u074	Ah, it's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so
s08_e08_c03_u075	Hot?
s08_e08_c03_u076	Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
s08_e08_c03_u077	She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
s08_e08_c03_u078	Well I-I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?
s08_e08_c03_u079	Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.
s08_e08_c03_u080	I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
s08_e08_c03_u081	(entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
s08_e08_c03_u082	What?
s08_e08_c03_u083	Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
s08_e08_c03_u084	Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper
s08_e08_c03_u085	Will you let the lady talk?!
s08_e08_c03_u086	Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.
s08_e08_c03_u087	Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.
s08_e08_c03_u088	So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a-a two month anniversary present.
s08_e08_c03_u089	Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his agreement.)
s08_e08_c03_u090	Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
s08_e08_c03_u091	All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
s08_e08_c03_u092	Yeah!
s08_e08_c03_u093	And Joey.
s08_e08_c03_u094	Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
s08_e08_c03_u095	Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
s08_e08_c03_u096	Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
s08_e08_c03_u097	I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
s08_e08_c03_u098	(on cell phone) I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
s08_e08_c04_u099	I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
s08_e08_c04_u100	I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
s08_e08_c04_u101	It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
s08_e08_c04_u102	All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.
s08_e08_c04_u103	I just called a friend of mine.
s08_e08_c04_u104	Yeah?
s08_e08_c04_u105	I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
s08_e08_c04_u106	Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares at her.) Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
s08_e08_c04_u107	What is it sweetie?
s08_e08_c04_u108	There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
s08_e08_c04_u109	What?!
s08_e08_c04_u110	I'm sorry daddy.
s08_e08_c04_u111	I don't believe this!!
s08_e08_c04_u112	Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
s08_e08_c04_u113	Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?! That's it! Is that it?!
s08_e08_c04_u114	Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.
s08_e08_c05_u115	So you uh, nervous about getting married?
s08_e08_c05_u116	What are you doing?
s08_e08_c05_u117	Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.
s08_e08_c05_u118	Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
s08_e08_c05_u119	How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
s08_e08_c05_u120	You're right, this is more fun.
s08_e08_c05_u121	That's her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)
s08_e08_c05_u122	Hi!
s08_e08_c05_u123	Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)
s08_e08_c05_u124	So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
s08_e08_c05_u125	Uh, that-that's-that's me!
s08_e08_c05_u126	That's me.
s08_e08_c05_u127	Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
s08_e08_c05_u128	So is that a bedroom? (Points to the guestroom.)
s08_e08_c05_u129	Yeah, yeah right over there.
s08_e08_c05_u130	All right, whenever you're ready. (She goes into the bedroom.)
s08_e08_c05_u131	That was weird.
s08_e08_c05_u132	Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
s08_e08_c05_u133	I'm waiting.
s08_e08_c05_u134	So she's a
s08_e08_c05_u135	Yeah, that's one naked hooker!
s08_e08_c06_u136	I love your place! Where is this guy from? (A statue from the top of his apothecary table.)
s08_e08_c06_u137	Uh that's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
s08_e08_c06_u138	Oh wow! So, you're more than just dinosaurs.
s08_e08_c06_u139	So much more.
s08_e08_c06_u140	Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm so sorry!
s08_e08_c06_u141	Aw forget it, it's from Pier One. (There's an angry knock on the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)
s08_e08_c06_u142	You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I'm gonna kill you!!
s08_e08_c06_u143	Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.
s08_e08_c07_u144	So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!
s08_e08_c07_u145	You got Rachel pregnant?!
s08_e08_c07_u146	Who did?!
s08_e08_c07_u147	You did!
s08_e08_c07_u148	Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
s08_e08_c07_u149	Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
s08_e08_c07_u150	No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.
s08_e08_c07_u151	What?!
s08_e08_c07_u152	(to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean-I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
s08_e08_c07_u153	Oh really? That's how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
s08_e08_c07_u154	(to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!
s08_e08_c07_u155	Wh
s08_e08_c07_u156	(To Mona) But I didn't want to.
s08_e08_c07_u157	Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
s08_e08_c07_u158	Tramp?!
s08_e08_c07_u159	I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
s08_e08_c08_u160	I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
s08_e08_c08_u161	Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.
s08_e08_c08_u162	Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Ma'am, are you also a stripper?
s08_e08_c08_u163	Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that's gonna cost extra. Okay, here's the extras, handcuffs, spanking- (Chandler grunts for her not to continue and Joey pulls him back into the kitchen.)
s08_e08_c08_u164	Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.
s08_e08_c08_u165	That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
s08_e08_c08_u166	I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
s08_e08_c08_u167	Do you mind if I smoke in here?
s08_e08_c08_u168	Oh actually, I'd rather you-Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
s08_e08_c09_u169	How could you have kept all of this from me?
s08_e08_c09_u170	I was going to tell you, but
s08_e08_c09_u171	But what?! You figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
s08_e08_c09_u172	Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The phone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only he's trapped behind the apothecary table by Dr. Green.) Can I just- (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why don't we just let the machine get that?
s08_e08_c09_u173	(on machine) Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
s08_e08_c09_u174	No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I need to, I need to lie down.
s08_e08_c10_u175	So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
s08_e08_c10_u176	Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
s08_e08_c10_u177	No problem. So who's the party for?
s08_e08_c10_u178	My husband.
s08_e08_c10_u179	You hired your husband a hooker?
s08_e08_c10_u180	She's a stripper.
s08_e08_c10_u181	No, she's a hooker.
s08_e08_c10_u182	Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
s08_e08_c10_u183	When they're hookers.
s08_e08_c10_u184	Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
s08_e08_c10_u185	Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
s08_e08_c11_u186	Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
s08_e08_c11_u187	Why would she do that?
s08_e08_c11_u188	Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?
s08_e08_c11_u189	This is the worst bachelor party ever!
s08_e08_c11_u190	What's taking you boys so long?
s08_e08_c11_u191	In a minute!
s08_e08_c11_u192	(To Joey) In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
s08_e08_c11_u193	All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
s08_e08_c11_u194	Why me?!
s08_e08_c11_u195	Hey! It's your bachelor party.
s08_e08_c11_u196	Which is why you should do it.
s08_e08_c11_u197	I don't want to. You do it!
s08_e08_c11_u198	You do it!
s08_e08_c11_u199	You do it!
s08_e08_c11_u200	All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! (Joey smirks.) What?
s08_e08_c11_u201	I miss this.
s08_e08_c11_u202	I don't think we've actually done this before!
s08_e08_c11_u203	No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
s08_e08_c11_u204	Well we-we still hang out.
s08_e08_c11_u205	Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like-things are different.
s08_e08_c11_u206	Well y'know, things are different. I'm-I'm married now.
s08_e08_c11_u207	Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just-I miss-hanging out-just-just us, y'know?
s08_e08_c11_u208	Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.
s08_e08_c11_u209	You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)
s08_e08_c11_u210	Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys. (Does the close sign.)
s08_e08_c11_u211	(entering quickly) She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a- (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes the hooker's hand.)
s08_e08_c12_u212	So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!
s08_e08_c12_u213	(quietly) Oh no
s08_e08_c12_u214	I'd better go. (She goes and sits down in the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000, the chair that Sit magazine called chair of the year, and they both look at her.) Just over here: I don't want to miss the fight.
s08_e08_c12_u215	Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
s08_e08_c12_u216	I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
s08_e08_c12_u217	Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?
s08_e08_c12_u218	Rachel!
s08_e08_c12_u219	All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
s08_e08_c12_u220	Okay!
s08_e08_c12_u221	Okay.
s08_e08_c12_u222	Thank you!
s08_e08_c12_u223	That's it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a break!" "No we weren't!" What happened to you two?!
s08_e08_c13_u224	Thank you so much for coming back over.
s08_e08_c13_u225	Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
s08_e08_c13_u226	I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
s08_e08_c13_u227	Focus.
s08_e08_c13_u228	Okay. Um-But-Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
s08_e08_c13_u229	How can I be sure on that?
s08_e08_c13_u230	Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!
s08_e08_c13_u231	Yeah.
s08_e08_c13_u232	I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
s08_e08_c13_u233	Trying to date this woman.
s08_e08_c13_u234	Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)
s08_e08_c13_u235	Probably shouldn't touch me.
s08_e08_c13_u236	Y'know, I-I-I just-I don't want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
s08_e08_c13_u237	I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at her.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)
s08_e08_c13_u238	Should I leave this open for you too?
s08_e08_c13_u239	I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
s08_e08_c13_u240	Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
s08_e08_c13_u241	Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
s08_e08_c13_u242	I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father. Look I-I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!
s08_e08_c13_u243	Okay, I guess you can-close the door now. (He does so and they kiss.)
s08_e08_c13_u244	(entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh, you guys made up. (To Mona) He's a good kisser isn't he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.) I'm going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)
s08_e08_c14_u245	I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean wh-Did you let her smoke in here?
s08_e08_c14_u246	Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
s08_e08_c14_u247	Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper (turns on the radio), and you're gonna get a stripper. (She starts to strip.)
s08_e08_c14_u248	Monica! Wait!
s08_e08_c14_u249	What?
s08_e08_c14_u250	(puts on his crown) Carry on.
s08_e08_c14_u251	Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off. (Goes to do so.)
s08_e08_c14_u252	Could you not narrate?
s08_e08_c14_u253	Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)
s08_e08_c15_u254	(on phone) -just because you're not in love with the guy you can't
s08_e08_c15_u255	(entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth.
s08_e08_c15_u256	About an hour ago.
s08_e08_c15_u257	Wanna go see a movie?
s08_e08_c15_u258	Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it up.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)
s08_e08_c15_u259	(on phone, not hearing her) -there's gonna be a wedding! (Joey enters from his room and goes to get a beer from the fridge.) That's unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love! (Joey hears something and looks around for the source.) -constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision. (Joey finds that the sound is coming from the phone and puts it to his ear.)
s08_e08_c15_u260	(on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! (Listens) What gives you the right to- (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone and opens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone.
s05_e09_c01_u001	What am I sitting on?
s05_e09_c01_u002	Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.
s05_e09_c01_u003	(taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!
s05_e09_c01_u004	All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
s05_e09_c01_u005	Well, they're not mine!
s05_e09_c01_u006	Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
s05_e09_c01_u007	Yeah, they're mine.
s05_e09_c01_u008	See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
s05_e09_c01_u009	Why are they here?
s05_e09_c01_u010	I don't know uhh- (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
s05_e09_c01_u011	Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
s05_e09_c01_u012	Yeah!
s05_e09_c01_u013	Yeah!
s05_e09_c01_u014	(waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of the way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.
s05_e09_c01_u015	(reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.
s05_e09_c01_u016	That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! (Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?
s05_e09_c01_u017	(entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
s05_e09_c01_u018	Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)
s05_e09_c01_u019	(inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
s05_e09_c01_u020	Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't
s05_e09_c01_u021	(interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.
s05_e09_c01_u022	Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!
s05_e09_c01_u023	Well, yeah actually.
s05_e09_c01_u024	We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
s05_e09_c01_u025	I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
s05_e09_c01_u026	We are! Help us!
s05_e09_c01_u027	Help!
s05_e09_c01_u028	All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.
s05_e09_c01_u029	Joey!
s05_e09_c01_u030	Didn't think so.
s05_e09_c02_u031	Hey, Phoebe!
s05_e09_c02_u032	Hi, Pheebs!
s05_e09_c02_u033	Hey, Pheebs!
s05_e09_c02_u034	Hey, Pheebs!
s05_e09_c02_u035	What are you reading?
s05_e09_c02_u036	Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
s05_e09_c02_u037	I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
s05_e09_c02_u038	Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
s05_e09_c02_u039	Honey that sounds like fun.
s05_e09_c02_u040	Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
s05_e09_c02_u041	Okay.
s05_e09_c02_u042	Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
s05_e09_c02_u043	Oh, I read that in high school.
s05_e09_c02_u044	This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
s05_e09_c02_u045	(entering, depressed) Hi.
s05_e09_c02_u046	What's wrong buddy?
s05_e09_c02_u047	Someone at work ate my sandwich!
s05_e09_c02_u048	Well, what did the police say?
s05_e09_c02_u049	My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
s05_e09_c02_u050	Ross, it's just a sandwich!
s05_e09_c02_u051	Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
s05_e09_c02_u052	Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)
s05_e09_c02_u053	(quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
s05_e09_c02_u054	(reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
s05_e09_c02_u055	I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
s05_e09_c02_u056	Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
s05_e09_c02_u057	Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
s05_e09_c02_u058	Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
s05_e09_c02_u059	Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and the gang reads it.)
s05_e09_c02_u060	Whoa! Ohh!!
s05_e09_c02_u061	Phoebe, you are a bad ass!
s05_e09_c02_u062	Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
s05_e09_c02_u063	Phoebe?
s05_e09_c02_u064	Well, he stabbed me first!!
s05_e09_c03_u065	(To Phoebe) Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
s05_e09_c03_u066	Okay.
s05_e09_c03_u067	So Pheebs, what is the book about?
s05_e09_c03_u068	I thought you said you read it in high school.
s05_e09_c03_u069	Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?
s05_e09_c03_u070	Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
s05_e09_c03_u071	How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here (looks at his attendance sheet), Rachel Green?
s05_e09_c03_u072	Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
s05_e09_c03_u073	Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
s05_e09_c03_u074	Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
s05_e09_c03_u075	Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here
s05_e09_c03_u076	(To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!
s05_e09_c03_u077	Well, honey that was pretty obvious.
s05_e09_c03_u078	Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
s05_e09_c03_u079	What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
s05_e09_c03_u080	I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
s05_e09_c03_u081	Would ya care to venture one?
s05_e09_c03_u082	Would you care to venture one?
s05_e09_c03_u083	Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
s05_e09_c03_u084	Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
s05_e09_c03_u085	All right, let's move on.
s05_e09_c03_u086	Okay then.
s05_e09_c04_u087	Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
s05_e09_c04_u088	Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
s05_e09_c04_u089	(entering) Phoebe!
s05_e09_c04_u090	Yeah?
s05_e09_c04_u091	Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
s05_e09_c04_u092	Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
s05_e09_c04_u093	That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
s05_e09_c05_u094	God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.
s05_e09_c05_u095	So you uh, still wondering?
s05_e09_c05_u096	No, we just went out.
s05_e09_c05_u097	You're smart. I like that.
s05_e09_c05_u098	Oh, candles! (Notices something.) What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God! (As she storms out, Rachel returns and overhears the conversation.)
s05_e09_c05_u099	Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
s05_e09_c05_u100	I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date! (She storms away and Rachel enters to confront Joey.)
s05_e09_c05_u101	Hiya.
s05_e09_c05_u102	Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. (Looks around the room.) You were actually gonna- (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (Rachel stares in shock.)
s05_e09_c05_u103	What is going on here?
s05_e09_c05_u104	And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
s05_e09_c05_u105	I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points at Chandler, angrily.)
s05_e09_c06_u106	You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
s05_e09_c06_u107	We're so sorry.
s05_e09_c06_u108	Yeah.
s05_e09_c06_u109	Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
s05_e09_c06_u110	No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.
s05_e09_c06_u111	Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
s05_e09_c06_u112	Oh-I don't know.
s05_e09_c06_u113	Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
s05_e09_c06_u114	Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
s05_e09_c06_u115	All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!
s05_e09_c07_u116	Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
s05_e09_c07_u117	Yeah, of course, Donald.
s05_e09_c07_u118	We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
s05_e09_c07_u119	What?!
s05_e09_c07_u120	Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.
s05_e09_c07_u121	(Proudly) Yeah.
s05_e09_c07_u122	We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
s05_e09_c07_u123	Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
s05_e09_c07_u124	(laughs) A sandwich?
s05_e09_c07_u125	Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here
s05_e09_c07_u126	(laughs) Oh, you know what?
s05_e09_c07_u127	What?
s05_e09_c07_u128	I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.
s05_e09_c07_u129	You ate my sandwich?
s05_e09_c07_u130	It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
s05_e09_c07_u131	(getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
s05_e09_c07_u132	No.
s05_e09_c07_u133	Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
s05_e09_c07_u134	There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.
s05_e09_c07_u135	(getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!
s05_e09_c07_u136	Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
s05_e09_c07_u137	(jumping to his feet in anger) What?
s05_e09_c07_u138	Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
s05_e09_c07_u139	You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
s05_e09_c07_u140	(losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
s05_e09_c07_u141	MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
s05_e09_c08_u142	Hi!
s05_e09_c08_u143	Hi!
s05_e09_c08_u144	(sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?
s05_e09_c08_u145	You didn't read this one either?!
s05_e09_c08_u146	Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.
s05_e09_c08_u147	What?
s05_e09_c08_u148	Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
s05_e09_c08_u149	No! You should've read it yourself!
s05_e09_c08_u150	Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
s05_e09_c08_u151	Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
s05_e09_c08_u152	A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
s05_e09_c08_u153	Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
s05_e09_c08_u154	(entering) Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
s05_e09_c08_u155	Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
s05_e09_c08_u156	Well, go ahead Rachel.
s05_e09_c08_u157	Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
s05_e09_c08_u158	If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
s05_e09_c08_u159	Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
s05_e09_c09_u160	Hey.
s05_e09_c09_u161	Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)
s05_e09_c09_u162	(gasps) You're naked in this picture!
s05_e09_c09_u163	I know.
s05_e09_c09_u164	Ross?
s05_e09_c09_u165	(in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!
s05_e09_c09_u166	Ross, are you okay?
s05_e09_c09_u167	I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
s05_e09_c09_u168	Why?!
s05_e09_c09_u169	On account of my rage.
s05_e09_c09_u170	Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
s05_e09_c09_u171	He gave me a pill for it.
s05_e09_c09_u172	A pill?
s05_e09_c09_u173	Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
s05_e09_c09_u174	Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
s05_e09_c09_u175	And you're okay with that?
s05_e09_c09_u176	I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
s05_e09_c10_u177	(entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
s05_e09_c10_u178	(smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
s05_e09_c10_u179	That was not funny!
s05_e09_c10_u180	Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
s05_e09_c10_u181	Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!
s05_e09_c10_u182	Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
s05_e09_c10_u183	Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?
s05_e09_c11_u184	(yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!
s05_e09_c11_u185	Monica, you asked the question.
s05_e09_c12_u186	(sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!
s05_e09_c12_u187	Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
s05_e09_c12_u188	You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
s05_e09_c12_u189	(entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?
s05_e09_c12_u190	Joey has got a secret peephole!
s05_e09_c12_u191	(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
s05_e09_c12_u192	Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
s05_e09_c12_u193	Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)
s05_e09_c12_u194	(covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the gang.)
s05_e09_c12_u195	(grabbing the picture) Give me that!
s05_e09_c12_u196	All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
s05_e09_c12_u197	No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just- I just- Kinda
s05_e09_c12_u198	All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
s05_e09_c12_u199	Thank you!
s05_e09_c12_u200	Joey's a sex addict.
s05_e09_c12_u201	What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading with Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!
s05_e09_c12_u202	It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
s05_e09_c12_u203	No! No! I am not a sex addict!
s05_e09_c12_u204	Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
s05_e09_c12_u205	No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
s05_e09_c12_u206	Well, what is the truth?
s05_e09_c12_u207	Yeah, what's going on?
s05_e09_c12_u208	What's going on?
s05_e09_c12_u209	(thinking) I slept with Monica.
s05_e09_c12_u210	Well let's-.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
s05_e09_c12_u211	Oh no!
s05_e09_c12_u212	You slept with my sister?
s05_e09_c12_u213	Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
s05_e09_c12_u214	This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)
s05_e09_c12_u215	Monica, is this true?
s05_e09_c12_u216	Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
s05_e09_c12_u217	Yes it's true.
s05_e09_c12_u218	Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
s05_e09_c12_u219	Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
s05_e09_c12_u220	I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir.
s05_e09_c12_u221	My God Monica!!
s05_e09_c12_u222	Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
s05_e09_c12_u223	No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
s05_e09_c12_u224	So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
s05_e09_c12_u225	That makes sense!
s05_e09_c12_u226	And the video camera?
s05_e09_c12_u227	Uhh, Monica?
s05_e09_c12_u228	I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
s05_e09_c12_u229	But sadly I could not be enticed.
s05_e09_c12_u230	Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
s05_e09_c12_u231	I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
s05_e09_c12_u232	Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)
s05_e09_c13_u233	I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
s05_e09_c13_u234	Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
s05_e09_c13_u235	I don't know! I didn't come with her!
s05_e09_c13_u236	(entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
s05_e09_c13_u237	A test?!!
s05_e09_c13_u238	Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We should have essay questions!!
s03_e25_c01_u001	(to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
s03_e25_c01_u002	All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
s03_e25_c01_u003	Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.
s03_e25_c01_u004	(to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
s03_e25_c01_u005	Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
s03_e25_c01_u006	Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
s03_e25_c01_u007	Well, I think we all learned something.
s03_e25_c01_u008	(entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) That's my Mom's writing! Look.
s03_e25_c01_u009	(reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
s03_e25_c01_u010	Y'know what that means?
s03_e25_c01_u011	That you're actually 50?
s03_e25_c01_u012	No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.
s03_e25_c01_u013	Oh!
s03_e25_c01_u014	That is so cool.
s03_e25_c01_u015	I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
s03_e25_c01_u016	Yeah! Yeah, we can!
s03_e25_c01_u017	(to Ross) Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
s03_e25_c01_u018	That's too bad.
s03_e25_c01_u019	(sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
s03_e25_c01_u020	So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
s03_e25_c01_u021	Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
s03_e25_c02_u022	(watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
s03_e25_c02_u023	You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
s03_e25_c02_u024	(sarcastic) Thanks!
s03_e25_c02_u025	Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
s03_e25_c02_u026	Yeah right.
s03_e25_c02_u027	Why is that so funny?
s03_e25_c02_u028	You made a joke right? So I laughed.
s03_e25_c02_u029	Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
s03_e25_c02_u030	Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)
s03_e25_c02_u031	Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like (in a fake voice) Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.
s03_e25_c02_u032	Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
s03_e25_c02_u033	(walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!
s03_e25_c02_u034	Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
s03_e25_c02_u035	No, it's just my luggage.
s03_e25_c02_u036	Hey!!
s03_e25_c02_u037	Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
s03_e25_c02_u038	Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
s03_e25_c02_u039	Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
s03_e25_c02_u040	Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
s03_e25_c02_u041	(approaching) Hey!
s03_e25_c02_u042	Hey!
s03_e25_c02_u043	Hey-hey, check out the hat!
s03_e25_c02_u044	What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!
s03_e25_c02_u045	Seriously, where did you get the hat?
s03_e25_c02_u046	Ross gave it to me.
s03_e25_c02_u047	Yeah, I think she looks good.
s03_e25_c02_u048	Ohh, thank you.
s03_e25_c02_u049	Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
s03_e25_c02_u050	Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
s03_e25_c02_u051	And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
s03_e25_c03_u052	Go, go, go!
s03_e25_c03_u053	Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
s03_e25_c03_u054	Oy!!
s03_e25_c03_u055	What's with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the floor, which is covered in sand)
s03_e25_c03_u056	Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
s03_e25_c03_u057	Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
s03_e25_c04_u058	Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.
s03_e25_c04_u059	(at the door) Knock, knock, knock.
s03_e25_c04_u060	(on phone) Ah, oh, hang on a second. (to Phoebe) Come in, come in. (on phone) All right, so think about it, and call me back. (hangs up)

s03_e25_c04_u069	Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
s03_e25_c04_u070	Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! (jumps up) I can make sangria!
s03_e25_c04_u071	No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
s03_e25_c04_u072	Oh.
s03_e25_c04_u073	(goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
s03_e25_c04_u074	Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.
s03_e25_c04_u075	(disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
s03_e25_c04_u076	Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.
s03_e25_c04_u077	Oh, what? What was it?
s03_e25_c04_u078	The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. (Phoebe notices a picture on the fridge, takes it, and puts it in her pocket.) Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
s03_e25_c04_u079	(happily) Yeah, no, it was great.
s03_e25_c05_u080	(getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
s03_e25_c05_u081	What?!
s03_e25_c05_u082	I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.
s03_e25_c05_u083	No, no!

s03_e25_c05_u087	Aww, thank you.
s03_e25_c05_u088	Okay, who's next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when she comes to Ross.)
s03_e25_c05_u089	No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a Please? look.) No way!
s03_e25_c05_u090	Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before.

s03_e25_c05_u094	Just once!
s03_e25_c05_u095	Stay away!
s03_e25_c05_u096	Take it like a man, Ross!
s03_e25_c05_u097	(he gets up and starts to run away from her) No! (in his escape attempt he crushes Chandler's sand castle) No!

s03_e25_c05_u107	Noo!!
s03_e25_c05_u108	(to Phoebe) So what's Phoebe like?
s03_e25_c05_u109	I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?
s03_e25_c05_u110	Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.
s03_e25_c05_u111	Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.

s03_e25_c05_u113	Really?!
s03_e25_c05_u114	Oh well, where is he?!
s03_e25_c05_u115	She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows Monica)! Isn't this what he would look like now?
s03_e25_c05_u116	(gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)
s03_e25_c05_u117	Oh, yeah.
s03_e25_c05_u118	Yeah!
s03_e25_c05_u119	Well, why would she lie to you?
s03_e25_c05_u120	I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?
s03_e25_c05_u121	Ohh!!
s03_e25_c05_u122	Yes!
s03_e25_c05_u123	All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
s03_e25_c05_u124	Okay, all right.
s03_e25_c05_u125	Okay.
s03_e25_c05_u126	Fan out! Fan out!

s03_e25_c05_u130	Strip Happy Days Game?
s03_e25_c05_u131	Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
s03_e25_c05_u132	Okay, (reading the card) Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah.
s03_e25_c05_u133	Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited.
s03_e25_c05_u134	Okay, come on! (blows on the dice) Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! (They all look at him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.
s03_e25_c05_u135	All right, relax. It's just a shoe.
s03_e25_c05_u136	Wooooo!!!!
s03_e25_c05_u137	(reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!
s03_e25_c05_u138	Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
s03_e25_c05_u139	Come on, take em off!!
s03_e25_c05_u140	Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
s03_e25_c05_u141	(getting up) All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas! (She pours the rest of the pitcher into Ross's glass.)
s03_e25_c05_u142	Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
s03_e25_c05_u143	I'm just making margaritas.
s03_e25_c05_u144	Okay.
s03_e25_c05_u145	I think I'll help her out. (She gets up to go over and help Rachel, and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is going on here?
s03_e25_c05_u146	What?!
s03_e25_c05_u147	You painting his toenails?
s03_e25_c05_u148	Oh, come on!
s03_e25_c05_u149	Chasing him all around the room?
s03_e25_c05_u150	Monica, please?
s03_e25_c05_u151	He's totally flirting with you too.
s03_e25_c05_u152	(pause) He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something... (she's interrupted by the sound of Bonnie entering)
s03_e25_c05_u153	Hey!
s03_e25_c05_u154	Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!
s03_e25_c05_u155	Hi! My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
s03_e25_c05_u156	Oh.
s03_e25_c05_u157	What are you guys doing?!
s03_e25_c05_u158	We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
s03_e25_c05_u159	Cool! I'll catch up! (She takes off her sweater.)
s03_e25_c06_u160	So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?
s03_e25_c06_u161	Huh?
s03_e25_c06_u162	I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
s03_e25_c06_u163	You didn't even take off your pants.
s03_e25_c06_u164	Yeah, well, lucky for you.
s03_e25_c06_u165	What?
s03_e25_c06_u166	I don't know.
s03_e25_c06_u167	(entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
s03_e25_c06_u168	Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
s03_e25_c06_u169	After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
s03_e25_c06_u170	Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
s03_e25_c06_u171	Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
s03_e25_c06_u172	Good morning.
s03_e25_c06_u173	Hey.
s03_e25_c06_u174	Hey! How did everybody sleep?
s03_e25_c06_u175	Oh, great.
s03_e25_c06_u176	Like a log.
s03_e25_c06_u177	Us too.
s03_e25_c06_u178	I'm going for a walk.
s03_e25_c06_u179	(to Joey) Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
s03_e25_c07_u180	Hey, what happened to you?
s03_e25_c07_u181	Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading.
s03_e25_c07_u182	Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
s03_e25_c07_u183	Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
s03_e25_c07_u184	Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
s03_e25_c07_u185	Ohh-ha-ha!
s03_e25_c07_u186	I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
s03_e25_c07_u187	Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
s03_e25_c07_u188	Really?!
s03_e25_c07_u189	Ohh!
s03_e25_c07_u190	Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
s03_e25_c07_u191	Really?!
s03_e25_c07_u192	Yeah!
s03_e25_c07_u193	I mean you definitely should do that.
s03_e25_c07_u194	Y'know what, I should do it.
s03_e25_c07_u195	Yeah!
s03_e25_c07_u196	Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.
s03_e25_c07_u197	Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
s03_e25_c07_u198	All right.
s03_e25_c08_u199	What's the matter, Pheebs?
s03_e25_c08_u200	She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
s03_e25_c08_u201	What?!
s03_e25_c08_u202	Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me.
s03_e25_c08_u203	Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
s03_e25_c08_u204	Yeah, well, don't Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet. (she starts to leave)
s03_e25_c08_u205	Where ya going?
s03_e25_c08_u206	Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
s03_e25_c08_u207	Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
s03_e25_c08_u208	Well, are any of those people here?!
s03_e25_c08_u209	Oh, no!! No, no!
s03_e25_c08_u210	Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.
s03_e25_c08_u211	Hey, everybody!
s03_e25_c08_u212	Wow!! (they all recoil in shock and horror)
s03_e25_c08_u213	Wh-haa-haa! Look what cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her mouth to keep from laughing.)
s03_e25_c08_u214	You wanna touch it?
s03_e25_c08_u215	Nooo, but it, but it's great.
s03_e25_c08_u216	Come on, touch it!
s03_e25_c08_u217	Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in your skull.
s03_e25_c09_u218	Hi.
s03_e25_c09_u219	Hi!
s03_e25_c09_u220	I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!
s03_e25_c09_u221	That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
s03_e25_c09_u222	She said you gave her the razor!
s03_e25_c09_u223	(joining them) Hey guys.
s03_e25_c09_u224	Hey!
s03_e25_c09_u225	So, anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?

s03_e25_c09_u230	You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
s03_e25_c09_u231	I don't know.
s03_e25_c09_u232	You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
s03_e25_c09_u233	All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
s03_e25_c09_u234	Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
s03_e25_c09_u235	Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
s03_e25_c09_u236	You still love me?
s03_e25_c09_u237	Noo.
s03_e25_c09_u238	You still love me.
s03_e25_c09_u239	Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
s03_e25_c09_u240	Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
s03_e25_c09_u241	Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so...
s03_e25_c09_u242	What?!
s03_e25_c09_u243	I just, I feel, I-I just...
s03_e25_c09_u244	What?
s03_e25_c09_u245	I feel...
s03_e25_c09_u246	(to Joey) Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
s03_e25_c09_u247	But I made cards!!
s03_e25_c09_u248	Well! Good night. (to Ross) I'm going upstairs.
s03_e25_c09_u249	G'night.
s03_e25_c09_u250	(to Ross) Wanna play strip poker for practice?
s03_e25_c10_u251	Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely inside and the window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!
s03_e25_c10_u252	No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
s03_e25_c10_u253	Then don't break in!!
s03_e25_c10_u254	I'm sorry.
s03_e25_c10_u255	What are you doing here?!
s03_e25_c10_u256	I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
s03_e25_c10_u257	What?!
s03_e25_c10_u258	Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! (pause) So, just tell me the truth!
s03_e25_c10_u259	All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
s03_e25_c10_u260	My Father is Chuck Magioni?
s03_e25_c10_u261	No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
s03_e25_c10_u262	Oh.
s03_e25_c10_u263	But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, (pause) ahh, (pause) okay. I'm your mother.
s03_e25_c10_u264	Heh?
s03_e25_c10_u265	Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
s03_e25_c11_u266	I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
s03_e25_c11_u267	That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
s03_e25_c11_u268	Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
s03_e25_c11_u269	I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
s03_e25_c11_u270	(coming back from her swim) Hey!
s03_e25_c11_u271	Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)
s03_e25_c11_u272	You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
s03_e25_c11_u273	Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
s03_e25_c11_u274	Okay, well g'night.
s03_e25_c11_u275	Good night.
s03_e25_c11_u276	(kisses Ross) Don't be too long.
s03_e25_c11_u277	Okey-dokey!
s03_e25_c11_u278	There is not one hair on that head.
s03_e25_c11_u279	Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
s03_e25_c11_u280	So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
s03_e25_c11_u281	Yeah.
s03_e25_c11_u282	Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
s03_e25_c12_u283	(entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)
s03_e25_c13_u284	(in a fake voice) Hi there.
s03_e25_c13_u285	That's that weird voice again.
s03_e25_c13_u286	Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
s03_e25_c13_u287	Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. (Monica walks away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
s01_e05_c01_u001	Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
s01_e05_c01_u002	Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
s01_e05_c01_u003	Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
s01_e05_c01_u004	We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
s01_e05_c01_u005	Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
s01_e05_c01_u006	Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
s01_e05_c01_u007	Multiple orgasms!
s01_e05_c02_u008	So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
s01_e05_c02_u009	No plans, huh?
s01_e05_c02_u010	Not a one.
s01_e05_c02_u011	Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
s01_e05_c02_u012	Oh, right, right, shut up.
s01_e05_c02_u013	Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
s01_e05_c02_u014	No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
s01_e05_c02_u015	Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
s01_e05_c02_u016	You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
s01_e05_c02_u017	Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
s01_e05_c02_u018	No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
s01_e05_c02_u019	Tony?
s01_e05_c02_u020	Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
s01_e05_c02_u021	Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
s01_e05_c02_u022	(waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
s01_e05_c02_u023	Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
s01_e05_c02_u024	(to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
s01_e05_c02_u025	It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
s01_e05_c02_u026	That guy, he burns me up.
s01_e05_c02_u027	Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
s01_e05_c02_u028	Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
s01_e05_c02_u029	Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
s01_e05_c02_u030	Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
s01_e05_c02_u031	(rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.
s01_e05_c02_u032	Hi, Joey.
s01_e05_c02_u033	My god, Angela.
s01_e05_c02_u034	Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
s01_e05_c02_u035	Are you gonna go over there?
s01_e05_c02_u036	No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela.
s01_e05_c02_u037	(casually) Joey.
s01_e05_c02_u038	You look good.
s01_e05_c02_u039	That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
s01_e05_c02_u040	You don't say.
s01_e05_c02_u041	So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
s01_e05_c02_u042	Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
s01_e05_c02_u043	Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
s01_e05_c02_u044	Who?
s01_e05_c02_u045	Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
s01_e05_c02_u046	Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
s01_e05_c02_u047	Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
s01_e05_c02_u048	Sure.
s01_e05_c02_u049	Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
s01_e05_c02_u050	Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
s01_e05_c02_u051	Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
s01_e05_c02_u052	Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
s01_e05_c02_u053	Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
s01_e05_c02_u054	What?
s01_e05_c02_u055	We're just friends.
s01_e05_c02_u056	Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
s01_e05_c02_u057	What four of us?
s01_e05_c02_u058	You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
s01_e05_c03_u059	Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
s01_e05_c03_u060	Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
s01_e05_c03_u061	Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
s01_e05_c03_u062	(looking out window) Oh, god help us.
s01_e05_c03_u063	What?
s01_e05_c03_u064	Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
s01_e05_c03_u065	Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
s01_e05_c03_u066	What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
s01_e05_c03_u067	(proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
s01_e05_c04_u068	(on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
s01_e05_c04_u069	Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
s01_e05_c04_u070	It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
s01_e05_c04_u071	It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
s01_e05_c04_u072	Nuh-uh.
s01_e05_c04_u073	Yuh-huh.
s01_e05_c04_u074	So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
s01_e05_c04_u075	Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear-you want it to be dirty?
s01_e05_c04_u076	(sheepish) No.
s01_e05_c04_u077	Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
s01_e05_c04_u078	Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
s01_e05_c04_u079	There you go.
s01_e05_c05_u080	Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
s01_e05_c05_u081	Yep.
s01_e05_c05_u082	Which?
s01_e05_c05_u083	Which what?
s01_e05_c05_u084	You've never met Bob, have you?
s01_e05_c05_u085	No, but he's...
s01_e05_c05_u086	Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
s01_e05_c05_u087	Hey, Joey.
s01_e05_c05_u088	...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
s01_e05_c06_u089	Where are they? Where are they?
s01_e05_c06_u090	This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
s01_e05_c06_u091	It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
s01_e05_c06_u092	Eww, I don't wanna do that.
s01_e05_c06_u093	Here we go.
s01_e05_c06_u094	Ok, have a good break-up.
s01_e05_c06_u095	Hey, Janice.
s01_e05_c06_u096	Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
s01_e05_c06_u097	Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
s01_e05_c06_u098	We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
s01_e05_c06_u099	What?
s01_e05_c06_u100	What?
s01_e05_c06_u101	(covering) What... did you get me there?
s01_e05_c06_u102	I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)
s01_e05_c06_u103	Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
s01_e05_c06_u104	Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
s01_e05_c06_u105	That's great.
s01_e05_c06_u106	Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
s01_e05_c06_u107	(holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine.
s01_e05_c06_u108	That's it?
s01_e05_c06_u109	Yeah, it was really hard.
s01_e05_c06_u110	Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
s01_e05_c06_u111	Ok, you weren't there.
s01_e05_c07_u112	Comin' through. Move, move.
s01_e05_c07_u113	Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
s01_e05_c07_u114	Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
s01_e05_c07_u115	But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
s01_e05_c07_u116	Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
s01_e05_c07_u117	What?
s01_e05_c07_u118	No suds, no save. Ok?
s01_e05_c07_u119	What's goin' on?
s01_e05_c07_u120	Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
s01_e05_c07_u121	Was your basket on top?
s01_e05_c07_u122	Yeah, but, there were no suds.
s01_e05_c07_u123	So?
s01_e05_c07_u124	Well, you know, no suds, no save.
s01_e05_c07_u125	No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's machine.
s01_e05_c07_u126	Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
s01_e05_c07_u127	Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
s01_e05_c07_u128	(to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.
s01_e05_c07_u129	That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
s01_e05_c07_u130	Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
s01_e05_c07_u131	What's that?
s01_e05_c07_u132	Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
s01_e05_c07_u133	Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
s01_e05_c07_u134	Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
s01_e05_c07_u135	Rach, have you never done this before?
s01_e05_c07_u136	Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
s01_e05_c07_u137	Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
s01_e05_c07_u138	(holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
s01_e05_c07_u139	(visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
s01_e05_c08_u140	(to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?
s01_e05_c08_u141	Brooklyn Heights.
s01_e05_c08_u142	Cleveland.
s01_e05_c08_u143	How, how did that happen?
s01_e05_c08_u144	Oh my god.
s01_e05_c08_u145	What?
s01_e05_c08_u146	I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
s01_e05_c09_u147	So, you and Angela, huh?
s01_e05_c09_u148	Yep. Pretty much.
s01_e05_c09_u149	You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
s01_e05_c09_u150	Huh, I never really noticed.
s01_e05_c09_u151	Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
s01_e05_c09_u152	Monica, Monica is great.
s01_e05_c09_u153	Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
s01_e05_c10_u154	I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
s01_e05_c10_u155	Yeah, isn't he?
s01_e05_c10_u156	It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
s01_e05_c10_u157	You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
s01_e05_c10_u158	Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
s01_e05_c10_u159	Huh. That's nice.
s01_e05_c11_u160	Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
s01_e05_c11_u161	Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
s01_e05_c11_u162	All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and begins to try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it.
s01_e05_c12_u163	Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
s01_e05_c12_u164	That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
s01_e05_c12_u165	What uh-oh?
s01_e05_c12_u166	(not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
s01_e05_c12_u167	Ross, what's the matter?
s01_e05_c12_u168	Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
s01_e05_c12_u169	Come on, show me.
s01_e05_c12_u170	All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
s01_e05_c12_u171	Oh, everything's pink.
s01_e05_c12_u172	Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
s01_e05_c12_u173	Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
s01_e05_c13_u174	Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
s01_e05_c13_u175	Oh my god.
s01_e05_c13_u176	What?
s01_e05_c13_u177	Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
s01_e05_c13_u178	Come on, they're close.
s01_e05_c13_u179	Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
s01_e05_c13_u180	Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
s01_e05_c13_u181	Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's-not really true, is it?
s01_e05_c13_u182	Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
s01_e05_c13_u183	Oh my god, what were you thinking?
s01_e05_c13_u184	All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
s01_e05_c13_u185	(hits him lightly) Oh!
s01_e05_c13_u186	Ow!
s01_e05_c13_u187	(leaving) I'm outta here.
s01_e05_c13_u188	Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
s01_e05_c13_u189	Really?
s01_e05_c13_u190	Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
s01_e05_c13_u191	I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
s01_e05_c13_u192	Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
s01_e05_c14_u193	Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
s01_e05_c14_u194	Ow!
s01_e05_c14_u195	Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
s01_e05_c14_u196	Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
s01_e05_c14_u197	(to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
s01_e05_c14_u198	Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you had?
s01_e05_c14_u199	Oh, I don't know, a million?
s01_e05_c14_u200	Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
s01_e05_c14_u201	I'm fine.
s01_e05_c14_u202	All right.
s01_e05_c14_u203	I'm not fine. Here she comes.
s01_e05_c14_u204	Wait here. Breathe.
s01_e05_c14_u205	How do you do that?
s01_e05_c14_u206	It's like a gift.
s01_e05_c14_u207	We should always always break up together.
s01_e05_c14_u208	Oh, I'd like that.
s01_e05_c15_u209	You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
s01_e05_c15_u210	Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
s01_e05_c15_u211	Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
s01_e05_c15_u212	Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
s01_e05_c15_u213	I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
s01_e05_c15_u214	Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
s01_e05_c15_u215	Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
s01_e05_c15_u216	Let go!
s01_e05_c15_u217	All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
s01_e05_c15_u218	(to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
s01_e05_c15_u219	You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
s01_e05_c15_u220	I could not have done this without you.
s01_e05_c15_u221	Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
s01_e05_c15_u222	Are you sure?
s01_e05_c15_u223	No.
s01_e05_c16_u224	Oh, are you sure you're ok?
s01_e05_c16_u225	Yeah.
s01_e05_c16_u226	Does it still hurt?
s01_e05_c16_u227	Yeah.
s01_e05_c16_u228	(seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
s01_e05_c16_u229	Hi.
s01_e05_c16_u230	Hey, how'd it go?
s01_e05_c16_u231	Excellent.
s01_e05_c16_u232	We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
s01_e05_c16_u233	What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
s01_e05_c16_u234	(notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.
s01_e05_c16_u235	Where's Chandler?
s01_e05_c16_u236	Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
s01_e05_c16_u237	I'm free! I'm free!
s01_e05_c16_u238	That oughta do it.
s08_e16_c01_u001	(closes the door) Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?
s08_e16_c01_u002	Yes.
s08_e16_c01_u003	Um, you-you like Rachel?
s08_e16_c01_u004	Yes. I like Rachel.
s08_e16_c01_u005	Rachel?!
s08_e16_c01_u006	(startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.
s08_e16_c01_u007	But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
s08_e16_c01_u008	Yeah, but it's not a big deal.
s08_e16_c01_u009	It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just-um, I-what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?
s08_e16_c01_u010	I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
s08_e16_c01_u011	Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?
s08_e16_c01_u012	Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.
s08_e16_c01_u013	Y'know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)
s08_e16_c01_u014	Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't
s08_e16_c01_u015	(stops) I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
s08_e16_c02_u016	Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!
s08_e16_c02_u017	Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She's growing inside you.
s08_e16_c02_u018	Whoa!!
s08_e16_c02_u019	Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
s08_e16_c02_u020	Wow that was a big one.
s08_e16_c02_u021	I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
s08_e16_c02_u022	(entering) Oh hey you guys!
s08_e16_c02_u023	Oh hey!
s08_e16_c02_u024	Hi!
s08_e16_c02_u025	Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
s08_e16_c02_u026	Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He'll find me.
s08_e16_c02_u027	Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?
s08_e16_c02_u028	No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.
s08_e16_c02_u029	Okay, good.
s08_e16_c02_u030	Why?
s08_e16_c02_u031	Well last night, I met Monica's.
s08_e16_c02_u032	What?
s08_e16_c02_u033	Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
s08_e16_c02_u034	Come on, don't be crazy. (To Rachel) You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)
s08_e16_c02_u035	(To Phoebe) Well, what's he like?!
s08_e16_c02_u036	Well he's tall.
s08_e16_c02_u037	Uh-huh.
s08_e16_c02_u038	He has brown hair.
s08_e16_c02_u039	Of course, of course.
s08_e16_c02_u040	A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
s08_e16_c02_u041	He works with food!
s08_e16_c02_u042	Oh sure. Older?
s08_e16_c02_u043	Obviously, and he's British.
s08_e16_c02_u044	Oh, I was just gonna ask!
s08_e16_c02_u045	Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.
s08_e16_c02_u046	Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
s08_e16_c02_u047	Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
s08_e16_c02_u048	Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.
s08_e16_c02_u049	You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
s08_e16_c02_u050	Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
s08_e16_c03_u051	Hey.
s08_e16_c03_u052	Hey.
s08_e16_c03_u053	I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.
s08_e16_c03_u054	Oh y'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's- It's like you and me going out, only weirder!
s08_e16_c03_u055	All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.
s08_e16_c03_u056	Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.
s08_e16_c03_u057	Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.
s08_e16_c03_u058	Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.
s08_e16_c03_u059	Joey-he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
s08_e16_c03_u060	He's not?
s08_e16_c03_u061	No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.
s08_e16_c03_u062	Why?
s08_e16_c03_u063	He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.
s08_e16_c03_u064	Hate him? I- No, I don't hate him. (Pause) It's just it's Rachel, y'know?
s08_e16_c03_u065	Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
s08_e16_c03_u066	Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.
s08_e16_c03_u067	All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
s08_e16_c04_u068	Oh! Hi!
s08_e16_c04_u069	Hi!
s08_e16_c04_u070	Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
s08_e16_c04_u071	Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandler's hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monica's hand.)
s08_e16_c04_u072	(mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.
s08_e16_c04_u073	(mouths to Phoebe) What?
s08_e16_c04_u074	(cough talks) Soul mate.
s08_e16_c04_u075	So, what have you guys been doing?
s08_e16_c04_u076	Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
s08_e16_c04_u077	I know! What is this, 1985?!
s08_e16_c04_u078	That's exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.
s08_e16_c04_u079	Not really.
s08_e16_c04_u080	What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there's staring.) No?
s08_e16_c04_u081	So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
s08_e16_c04_u082	Well, Octavio, 27&7-Oh! And there's this great little place, Alessandro's.
s08_e16_c04_u083	Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
s08_e16_c04_u084	You're kidding me!
s08_e16_c04_u085	No!
s08_e16_c04_u086	Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
s08_e16_c04_u087	Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you.
s08_e16_c04_u088	What are you doing?!
s08_e16_c04_u089	Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So
s08_e16_c04_u090	I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
s08_e16_c04_u091	They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
s08_e16_c04_u092	(returning) Phoebe, good work.
s08_e16_c04_u093	Yeah?
s08_e16_c04_u094	Yeah! Oh he's great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at Phoebe.)
s08_e16_c04_u095	Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.
s08_e16_c05_u096	Hey.
s08_e16_c05_u097	Hey.
s08_e16_c05_u098	Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
s08_e16_c05_u099	No, I don't want to hit you.
s08_e16_c05_u100	Oh what then? Kick me?
s08_e16_c05_u101	No.
s08_e16_c05_u102	(getting worried) Bite me?
s08_e16_c05_u103	No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and-and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)
s08_e16_c05_u104	Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
s08_e16_c05_u105	Uh-yeah sure. (Enters.)
s08_e16_c05_u106	Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't
s08_e16_c05_u107	Okay.
s08_e16_c05_u108	(pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh-I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)
s08_e16_c05_u109	Thank you.
s08_e16_c05_u110	Anyway, it uh-look it'll just-take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so
s08_e16_c05_u111	What?! You're in love with her.
s08_e16_c05_u112	Yeah, I thought you knew that.
s08_e16_c05_u113	Umm, no.
s08_e16_c05_u114	Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I'll get over this." Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?
s08_e16_c05_u115	I think you need to tell her how you feel.
s08_e16_c05_u116	Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
s08_e16_c05_u117	No, I'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
s08_e16_c05_u118	But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But
s08_e16_c05_u119	If she is where you are then uh-then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
s08_e16_c05_u120	Are you sure?
s08_e16_c05_u121	Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So
s08_e16_c05_u122	Hey thanks.
s08_e16_c05_u123	So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
s08_e16_c05_u124	Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
s08_e16_c05_u125	I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
s08_e16_c05_u126	I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!
s08_e16_c05_u127	Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys another sip.)
s08_e16_c06_u128	so I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
s08_e16_c06_u129	Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
s08_e16_c06_u130	Excuse me?
s08_e16_c06_u131	Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
s08_e16_c06_u132	Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
s08_e16_c06_u133	Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
s08_e16_c06_u134	And you're still married to him? (They both laugh, and Chandler tries to but fails.)
s08_e16_c06_u135	You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries- (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.
s08_e16_c06_u136	Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
s08_e16_c06_u137	Is it made of cheese?
s08_e16_c06_u138	No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?!
s08_e16_c06_u139	I'd move in tomorrow!
s08_e16_c06_u140	(disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
s08_e16_c06_u141	I'm so sorry.
s08_e16_c06_u142	What do we do?
s08_e16_c06_u143	I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.
s08_e16_c07_u144	Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as Rachel opens the door and startles him.)
s08_e16_c07_u145	Joey? What's up?
s08_e16_c07_u146	I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
s08_e16_c07_u147	Okay what's up?
s08_e16_c07_u148	Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
s08_e16_c07_u149	Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
s08_e16_c07_u150	Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I-want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all.
s08_e16_c07_u151	Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)
s08_e16_c07_u152	Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles Joey again.) Don't you people ever knock?!
s08_e16_c08_u153	I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
s08_e16_c08_u154	Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
s08_e16_c08_u155	Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
s08_e16_c08_u156	Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
s08_e16_c08_u157	Jeez! What is with you?
s08_e16_c08_u158	I'm sorry, did you say cheese?
s08_e16_c08_u159	All right, what's going on?
s08_e16_c08_u160	Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
s08_e16_c08_u161	Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
s08_e16_c08_u162	No. But I'm sure (mimics Don) tomatoes' does.
s08_e16_c08_u163	I don't believe in soul mates either.
s08_e16_c08_u164	You don't?
s08_e16_c08_u165	No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
s08_e16_c08_u166	So you-you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
s08_e16_c08_u167	No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
s08_e16_c08_u168	I love you.
s08_e16_c08_u169	I know.
s08_e16_c08_u170	Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesn't look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.
s08_e16_c09_u171	and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I'm really worried the baby's not going to like him. (Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?
s08_e16_c09_u172	What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason-(Exhales slowly)-Is it hot in here?
s08_e16_c09_u173	No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
s08_e16_c09_u174	I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
s08_e16_c09_u175	Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
s08_e16_c09_u176	Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)
s08_e16_c09_u177	Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.
s08_e16_c09_u178	Uh- How long have we known each other?
s08_e16_c09_u179	Um, seven-e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
s08_e16_c09_u180	Uh-huh, long time.
s08_e16_c09_u181	Yeah.
s08_e16_c09_u182	But over the past few weeks
s08_e16_c09_u183	Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight
s08_e16_c09_u184	Actually uh, could you give us a second?
s08_e16_c09_u185	Sure. Sure. (Turns away, then turns back) Second's up! (Joey glares at him.) Not-that kind of table. (He walks away.)
s08_e16_c09_u186	So you were saying?
s08_e16_c09_u187	I'm not quite sure.
s08_e16_c09_u188	Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm-now here we are.
s08_e16_c09_u189	Yeah, here we are. Uhh- I- I think I'm-falling in love with you.
s08_e16_c09_u190	(stunned) What?
s08_e16_c09_u191	I'm falling in love with you.
s08_e16_c09_u192	(looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, you're kidding! Oh, it's a joke! (Laughs.) It's funny. It's funny. I don't get it. (Joey doesn't say any thing and Rachel realizes it's not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay. Umm- I-I-uh, wow. Are you uh- How did umm- When?
s08_e16_c09_u193	Does it really matter?
s08_e16_c09_u194	Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
s08_e16_c09_u195	Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don't have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay, you gotta say something!
s08_e16_c09_u196	Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I
s08_e16_c09_u197	But. (Hangs his head down.)
s08_e16_c09_u198	Joey.
s08_e16_c09_u199	Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go. (Stands up.)
s08_e16_c09_u200	No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)
s08_e16_c09_u201	Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, cause then you're gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to her.)
s08_e16_c09_u202	Can I? (Hug him.)
s08_e16_c09_u203	Sure!
s08_e16_c09_u204	Oh Joey honey I don't-I don't want to lose
s08_e16_c09_u205	Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!
s08_e16_c09_u206	I'm so sorry.
s08_e16_c09_u207	Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. (They hug again.) Y'know I was only kidding you.
s08_e16_c09_u208	Yeah, that was a real good one.
s08_e16_c10_u209	Is this your table?
s08_e16_c10_u210	Yeah.
s08_e16_c10_u211	God, you're gonna be here all night!
s08_e16_c10_u212	I know! I haven't even read them the specials yet!
s08_e16_c10_u213	What's the matter with them?
s08_e16_c10_u214	I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying. (Pause) I kinda hope it's the girl. (The other waiter is shocked.) The guy is really cute!
s10_e10_c01_u001	My God, get a room!
s10_e10_c01_u002	I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
s10_e10_c01_u003	If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
s10_e10_c01_u004	(with no hesitation) Sex!
s10_e10_c01_u005	(looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!
s10_e10_c01_u006	Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!
s10_e10_c01_u007	(to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.
s10_e10_c01_u008	Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
s10_e10_c01_u009	Food.
s10_e10_c01_u010	Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
s10_e10_c01_u011	Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
s10_e10_c01_u012	Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
s10_e10_c01_u013	Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
s10_e10_c01_u014	No, you gotta pick one!
s10_e10_c01_u015	Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
s10_e10_c02_u016	You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
s10_e10_c02_u017	Oh, how cute!
s10_e10_c02_u018	Yeah.
s10_e10_c02_u019	Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
s10_e10_c02_u020	Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
s10_e10_c02_u021	Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. (he's on the street, talking to a woman)
s10_e10_c02_u022	Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
s10_e10_c02_u023	OH! He's having an affair.
s10_e10_c02_u024	He's not having an affair!
s10_e10_c02_u025	You know, I'm always right about these things.
s10_e10_c02_u026	No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
s10_e10_c02_u027	Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
s10_e10_c02_u028	Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
s10_e10_c02_u029	Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)
s10_e10_c02_u030	(picking up the phone) Hello.
s10_e10_c02_u031	Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
s10_e10_c02_u032	Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
s10_e10_c02_u033	(shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
s10_e10_c02_u034	Those are all really old!
s10_e10_c02_u035	Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
s10_e10_c02_u036	(whispering) "Dude, Where's My Car?"
s10_e10_c02_u037	(glancing at her) What?
s10_e10_c02_u038	They're in a caaar...
s10_e10_c02_u039	(to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
s10_e10_c02_u040	Geez!
s10_e10_c02_u041	Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
s10_e10_c02_u042	Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
s10_e10_c02_u043	(patting her bag) I got them!
s10_e10_c03_u044	Hi!
s10_e10_c03_u045	Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
s10_e10_c03_u046	I was in the car with Nancy all day.
s10_e10_c03_u047	Nancy doesn’t smoke!
s10_e10_c03_u048	Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
s10_e10_c03_u049	So? What do you think of the house?
s10_e10_c03_u050	It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
s10_e10_c03_u051	Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
s10_e10_c03_u052	And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?
s10_e10_c03_u053	Don’t you love the huge yard?
s10_e10_c03_u054	And the fireplace in the bedroom.
s10_e10_c03_u055	And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
s10_e10_c03_u056	This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
s10_e10_c03_u057	So? Do you think we should get it?
s10_e10_c03_u058	I don’t know. What do you think?
s10_e10_c03_u059	I think we should.
s10_e10_c03_u060	I do too.
s10_e10_c03_u061	This is huge!
s10_e10_c03_u062	I know.
s10_e10_c03_u063	How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
s10_e10_c03_u064	I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
s10_e10_c03_u065	Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
s10_e10_c03_u066	We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
s10_e10_c03_u067	Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
s10_e10_c03_u068	I know. Gooooood luck with it.
s10_e10_c04_u069	I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
s10_e10_c04_u070	I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
s10_e10_c04_u071	Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
s10_e10_c04_u072	I know, and with the baby coming?
s10_e10_c04_u073	So, should we tell her?
s10_e10_c04_u074	I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
s10_e10_c04_u075	Why? Who’d you seen him with?
s10_e10_c04_u076	No one, I’m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)
s10_e10_c04_u077	TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
s10_e10_c04_u078	(yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
s10_e10_c04_u079	All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
s10_e10_c04_u080	Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)
s10_e10_c05_u081	Oh, look at her, so happy!
s10_e10_c05_u082	If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
s10_e10_c05_u083	Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
s10_e10_c05_u084	No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
s10_e10_c05_u085	Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.
s10_e10_c05_u086	We think Chandler might be having an affair.
s10_e10_c05_u087	What?
s10_e10_c05_u088	Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
s10_e10_c05_u089	They went in together. So sorry.
s10_e10_c05_u090	Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
s10_e10_c05_u091	What?
s10_e10_c05_u092	(walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
s10_e10_c05_u093	Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)
s10_e10_c05_u094	Hey!
s10_e10_c05_u095	(to Chandler) You son of a bitch!
s10_e10_c05_u096	Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
s10_e10_c05_u097	(goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
s10_e10_c05_u098	Who's Nancy?
s10_e10_c05_u099	What's going on?
s10_e10_c05_u100	(turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
s10_e10_c05_u101	Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
s10_e10_c05_u102	I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
s10_e10_c05_u103	Why do you have a realtor?
s10_e10_c05_u104	Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
s10_e10_c05_u105	(clearly shocked) What?
s10_e10_c05_u106	Are you serious?
s10_e10_c05_u107	When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
s10_e10_c05_u108	So you're gonna move?
s10_e10_c05_u109	Oh my God.
s10_e10_c05_u110	Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
s10_e10_c05_u111	What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
s10_e10_c05_u112	And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
s10_e10_c05_u113	...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
s10_e10_c05_u114	(sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
s10_e10_c05_u115	Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
s10_e10_c05_u116	You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
s10_e10_c05_u117	No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)
s10_e10_c05_u118	(to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
s10_e10_c05_u119	Actually, we already found a house we love.
s10_e10_c05_u120	What?
s10_e10_c05_u121	And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
s10_e10_c05_u122	Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
s10_e10_c05_u123	You put an offer on a house?
s10_e10_c05_u124	(smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)
s10_e10_c05_u125	Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
s10_e10_c05_u126	I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
s10_e10_c05_u127	Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can!
s10_e10_c05_u128	(goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)
s10_e10_c05_u129	We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?
s10_e10_c05_u130	Yeah it is.
s10_e10_c05_u131	What the hell are you doin'?
s10_e10_c05_u132	Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
s10_e10_c05_u133	Yeah, but so is this.
s10_e10_c05_u134	Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
s10_e10_c05_u135	(talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
s10_e10_c05_u136	You can see where he'd have trouble.
s10_e10_c05_u137	Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
s10_e10_c05_u138	Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
s10_e10_c05_u139	That money is mine, Green!
s10_e10_c05_u140	You're fly is open, Geller!
s10_e10_c05_u141	You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
s10_e10_c05_u142	Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
s10_e10_c05_u143	[looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
s10_e10_c05_u144	Ow, that had to hurt!
s10_e10_c05_u145	Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
s10_e10_c05_u146	We will. (they don’t move)
s10_e10_c05_u147	Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
s10_e10_c05_u148	No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
s10_e10_c05_u149	Every year.
s10_e10_c05_u150	(he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!
s10_e10_c05_u151	(walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
s10_e10_c05_u152	I put it on to scare Chandler!
s10_e10_c05_u153	Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
s10_e10_c05_u154	It smells really bad in here.
s10_e10_c05_u155	Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
s10_e10_c05_u156	Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
s10_e10_c05_u157	It's Joey.
s10_e10_c05_u158	I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
s10_e10_c05_u159	Oooohh that’s interesting.
s10_e10_c05_u160	If you win, we give up the birds.
s10_e10_c05_u161	(shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)
s10_e10_c05_u162	But if we win, we get your apartment.
s10_e10_c05_u163	Oooooh!
s10_e10_c05_u164	Deal!
s10_e10_c05_u165	What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
s10_e10_c05_u166	Big fat goalie.
s10_e10_c05_u167	Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
s10_e10_c05_u168	Dangerous Liaisons.
s10_e10_c05_u169	Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
s10_e10_c05_u170	Weekend at Bernie’s.
s10_e10_c05_u171	Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
s10_e10_c05_u172	Everyday use.
s10_e10_c05_u173	Fancy.
s10_e10_c05_u174	Guest.
s10_e10_c05_u175	Fancy guest.
s10_e10_c05_u176	Two seconds...
s10_e10_c05_u177	Uhh, 11!
s10_e10_c05_u178	11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.)
s10_e10_c05_u179	(to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
s10_e10_c05_u180	14?
s10_e10_c05_u181	No, 19.
s10_e10_c05_u182	Thanks man.
s10_e10_c05_u183	Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
s10_e10_c05_u184	Maurice.
s10_e10_c05_u185	Correct, his profession was?
s10_e10_c05_u186	Space cowboy!
s10_e10_c05_u187	Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
s10_e10_c05_u188	Ow...Oh Gosh!
s10_e10_c05_u189	10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
s10_e10_c05_u190	It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
s10_e10_c05_u191	Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!
s10_e10_c05_u192	That’s not even a word!
s10_e10_c05_u193	NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
s10_e10_c05_u194	Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
s10_e10_c05_u195	Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
s10_e10_c05_u196	That is not true. She did! She forced me!
s10_e10_c05_u197	Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
s10_e10_c05_u198	Well it stupid, unfair question!
s10_e10_c05_u199	Don’t blame the questions!
s10_e10_c05_u200	Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
s10_e10_c05_u201	Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
s10_e10_c05_u202	(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
s10_e10_c05_u203	(She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
s10_e10_c05_u204	What the hell are doing?!!
s10_e10_c05_u205	(running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!
s10_e10_c05_u206	Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
s10_e10_c05_u207	(panicking) Dude! He's right there!
s10_e10_c05_u208	(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
s10_e10_c05_u209	Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
s10_e10_c05_u210	I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
s10_e10_c05_u211	(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)
s10_e10_c05_u212	Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
s10_e10_c05_u213	Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
s10_e10_c05_u214	Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
s10_e10_c05_u215	What?!
s10_e10_c05_u216	You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
s10_e10_c05_u217	Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
s10_e10_c05_u218	Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
s10_e10_c05_u219	What else?
s10_e10_c05_u220	When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
s10_e10_c05_u221	Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
s10_e10_c05_u222	That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
s10_e10_c05_u223	When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
s10_e10_c05_u224	Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
s10_e10_c05_u225	And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
s10_e10_c05_u226	(entering) Hey.
s10_e10_c05_u227	She really left.
s10_e10_c05_u228	I know. (He kisses her.)
s10_e10_c05_u229	Thank you.
s10_e10_c05_u230	No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
s10_e10_c05_u231	Can I ask you a question?
s10_e10_c05_u232	Sure!
s10_e10_c05_u233	What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
s10_e10_c05_u234	Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
s10_e10_c05_u235	That's so sweet.
s10_e10_c05_u236	And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
s10_e10_c05_u237	And a crappy New Year.
s10_e10_c05_u238	Here, here!
s10_e10_c06_u239	You can't move. You just... you just can't.
s10_e10_c06_u240	Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
s10_e10_c06_u241	Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
s10_e10_c06_u242	You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)
s10_e10_c06_u243	Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.
s10_e10_c06_u244	Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
s10_e10_c06_u245	And?
s10_e10_c06_u246	(to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
s10_e10_c06_u247	We can't afford that.
s10_e10_c06_u248	I know.
s10_e10_c06_u249	Well, there you go.
s10_e10_c06_u250	I'm really sorry you guys.
s10_e10_c06_u251	Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
s10_e10_c06_u252	Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
s10_e10_c06_u253	(to Monica) You're gonna be okay?
s10_e10_c06_u254	Yeah, we'll be okay.
s10_e10_c06_u255	Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
s10_e10_c06_u256	You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
s10_e10_c06_u257	That's okay, we understand.
s10_e10_c06_u258	And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
s10_e10_c06_u259	I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
s10_e10_c06_u260	Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
s10_e10_c06_u261	What?
s10_e10_c06_u262	We got the house.
s10_e10_c06_u263	Oh my God!
s10_e10_c06_u264	I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
s10_e10_c06_u265	Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
s10_e10_c06_u266	We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.
s10_e10_c06_u267	And a baby...
s10_e10_c06_u268	We're growing up.
s10_e10_c06_u269	We sure are.
s10_e10_c06_u270	So who's gonna tell them?
s10_e10_c06_u271	(quickly) Not it!
s10_e10_c06_u272	Not it! Damn it!
s10_e10_c07_u273	Rachel, this is yours.
s10_e10_c07_u274	Aah! Why? What are these for?
s10_e10_c07_u275	You'll see.
s10_e10_c07_u276	All right, everybody open them!
s10_e10_c07_u277	Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
s10_e10_c07_u278	Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)
s10_e10_c07_u279	I know.
s10_e10_c07_u280	I love this. (he got a sweater)
s10_e10_c07_u281	A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)
s10_e10_c07_u282	Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
s10_e10_c07_u283	Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
s10_e10_c07_u284	Enjoy!
s10_e10_c07_u285	(speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) What did they say?
s03_e10_c01_u001	(reading the comics) Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
s03_e10_c01_u002	What?
s03_e10_c01_u003	Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
s03_e10_c01_u004	Rachel?
s03_e10_c01_u005	Yeah.
s03_e10_c01_u006	Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
s03_e10_c01_u007	Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
s03_e10_c01_u008	(laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
s03_e10_c01_u009	(to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?
s03_e10_c01_u010	(thinks about it) Yeah?
s03_e10_c02_u011	So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call, then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird flapping it's wings.)
s03_e10_c02_u012	Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
s03_e10_c02_u013	Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
s03_e10_c02_u014	Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
s03_e10_c02_u015	I was shrieking... like a Marine.
s03_e10_c02_u016	All right here. Watch me execute the three P's of championship play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a backswing and hits Sarah who's started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both watch in horror.)
s03_e10_c03_u017	You broke a little girl's leg?!!
s03_e10_c03_u018	I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
s03_e10_c03_u019	(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?
s03_e10_c03_u020	Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
s03_e10_c03_u021	Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
s03_e10_c03_u022	I'm gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)
s03_e10_c03_u023	All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)
s03_e10_c03_u024	Look out kids, he's coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)
s03_e10_c03_u025	And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
s03_e10_c03_u026	Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
s03_e10_c03_u027	What? Me having a job?
s03_e10_c03_u028	No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey, how do you sleep at night?
s03_e10_c03_u029	Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
s03_e10_c03_u030	Really?
s03_e10_c03_u031	Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
s03_e10_c03_u032	...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
s03_e10_c03_u033	Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)
s03_e10_c03_u034	What if you put them here. (sets the empty tray on another stack of empty trays on the back counter.)
s03_e10_c03_u035	Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
s03_e10_c03_u036	They already do. That's why they call it the tray spot.'
s03_e10_c03_u037	Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry. (walks away)
s03_e10_c03_u038	It's all right. Sweetheart.
s03_e10_c04_u039	So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
s03_e10_c04_u040	Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
s03_e10_c04_u041	Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
s03_e10_c04_u042	Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
s03_e10_c04_u043	I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
s03_e10_c04_u044	No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
s03_e10_c04_u045	Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
s03_e10_c04_u046	The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
s03_e10_c04_u047	Yeah.
s03_e10_c04_u048	So far, I've sold seventy-five.
s03_e10_c04_u049	Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his wallet) How much are the boxes?
s03_e10_c04_u050	Five dollars a box.
s03_e10_c04_u051	(puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?
s03_e10_c04_u052	A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
s03_e10_c04_u053	Well, that makes sense.
s03_e10_c04_u054	Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
s03_e10_c04_u055	Yeah, Sarah, anything.
s03_e10_c04_u056	Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
s03_e10_c05_u057	(looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.) Yesss?
s03_e10_c05_u058	Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
s03_e10_c05_u059	You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
s03_e10_c05_u060	No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird salute.)
s03_e10_c05_u061	What does that mean?
s03_e10_c05_u062	Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
s03_e10_c05_u063	I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
s03_e10_c05_u064	No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
s03_e10_c05_u065	I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
s03_e10_c05_u066	Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)
s03_e10_c05_u067	I can still see you!
s03_e10_c05_u068	All right!!
s03_e10_c06_u069	(walking up to Joey) Hey.
s03_e10_c06_u070	Hey. What, what are you doing here?
s03_e10_c06_u071	Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...
s03_e10_c06_u072	Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
s03_e10_c06_u073	Destiny.
s03_e10_c06_u074	Sure.
s03_e10_c06_u075	Yes.
s03_e10_c06_u076	All right.
s03_e10_c06_u077	Okay. (One of Joey's co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
s03_e10_c06_u078	Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
s03_e10_c06_u079	You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
s03_e10_c06_u080	Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
s03_e10_c06_u081	So, what happens to the old guys?
s03_e10_c06_u082	Well, they go into the chipper.
s03_e10_c06_u083	Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? (Joey points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against Joey's shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)
s03_e10_c06_u084	(to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the cut it' motion with his hands)
s03_e10_c07_u085	...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
s03_e10_c07_u086	All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
s03_e10_c07_u087	Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
s03_e10_c07_u088	Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
s03_e10_c07_u089	No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
s03_e10_c07_u090	Mon?
s03_e10_c07_u091	All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross) Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
s03_e10_c07_u092	Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
s03_e10_c07_u093	No.
s03_e10_c07_u094	Oh, come on, now you know you want em.
s03_e10_c07_u095	Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
s03_e10_c07_u096	I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
s03_e10_c07_u097	(she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)
s03_e10_c07_u098	Come on! All the cool kids are eating em! (chases after her.)
s03_e10_c07_u099	And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
s03_e10_c07_u100	(sitting down next to Chandler) I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
s03_e10_c07_u101	Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
s03_e10_c07_u102	Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
s03_e10_c07_u103	How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
s03_e10_c07_u104	Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
s03_e10_c07_u105	If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
s03_e10_c07_u106	The fear?
s03_e10_c07_u107	He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
s03_e10_c07_u108	Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get the fear'?
s03_e10_c07_u109	Because, I'm too afraid.
s03_e10_c07_u110	I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
s03_e10_c07_u111	Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
s03_e10_c07_u112	Rachel?
s03_e10_c07_u113	Yeah.
s03_e10_c07_u114	Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
s03_e10_c07_u115	Can't I just look at the handles on them?
s03_e10_c07_u116	You would think.
s03_e10_c07_u117	Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
s03_e10_c07_u118	What?!
s03_e10_c07_u119	Gunther, I quit.
s03_e10_c07_u120	(to Joey) Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)
s03_e10_c08_u121	....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?
s03_e10_c08_u122	I spelled out boobies.
s03_e10_c08_u123	(comes up and starts looking through Ross's cookie supply) Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
s03_e10_c08_u124	Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
s03_e10_c08_u125	What?
s03_e10_c08_u126	Monica, I'm cutting you off.
s03_e10_c08_u127	No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
s03_e10_c08_u128	Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
s03_e10_c08_u129	(covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)
s03_e10_c08_u130	So, how many have you sold so far?
s03_e10_c08_u131	Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
s03_e10_c08_u132	Oh my God, how did you do that?
s03_e10_c08_u133	Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
s03_e10_c08_u134	(entering) Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
s03_e10_c08_u135	Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
s03_e10_c08_u136	Me! On my computer.
s03_e10_c08_u137	Well you sure used a large font.
s03_e10_c08_u138	Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
s03_e10_c08_u139	Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
s03_e10_c08_u140	Something else I might have said?
s03_e10_c08_u141	I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
s03_e10_c08_u142	Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
s03_e10_c08_u143	No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
s03_e10_c08_u144	You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
s03_e10_c08_u145	You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
s03_e10_c08_u146	(entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!
s03_e10_c08_u147	Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)
s03_e10_c08_u148	What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
s03_e10_c08_u149	No.
s03_e10_c08_u150	Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
s03_e10_c08_u151	Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
s03_e10_c08_u152	Not a problem.
s03_e10_c08_u153	Thanks.
s03_e10_c08_u154	And now for the great news.
s03_e10_c08_u155	What, that wasn't the great news?
s03_e10_c08_u156	Only if you think it's better than this... (holds up an aerosol can) snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
s03_e10_c08_u157	Christmas cookie?
s03_e10_c09_u158	Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
s03_e10_c09_u159	Looks good. I'll take it.
s03_e10_c09_u160	(running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)
s03_e10_c09_u161	It's-it's-it's almost dead!
s03_e10_c09_u162	Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
s03_e10_c09_u163	Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
s03_e10_c09_u164	I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
s03_e10_c09_u165	Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
s03_e10_c09_u166	(entering) Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
s03_e10_c09_u167	Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one's yours! Ahhh.
s03_e10_c09_u168	Is this the one that I threw out last year?
s03_e10_c09_u169	All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
s03_e10_c09_u170	Oh honey, is that cause your Mom died around Christmas?
s03_e10_c09_u171	Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
s03_e10_c09_u172	Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a way-to-go' thumbs up and smile.)
s03_e10_c10_u173	(to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
s03_e10_c10_u174	I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
s03_e10_c10_u175	Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
s03_e10_c10_u176	You're a big scrud.
s03_e10_c10_u177	What's a scrud?
s03_e10_c10_u178	Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
s03_e10_c10_u179	I don't have too. I can just look at you.
s03_e10_c10_u180	All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. (all the girls raise their hands) Ohhhh, Debbie, (looks at her form) 321 boxes of cookies, (to Debbie) Very nice.
s03_e10_c10_u181	(to himself) Not nice enough.
s03_e10_c10_u182	Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
s03_e10_c10_u183	(to himself) Good for a scrud.
s03_e10_c10_u184	Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
s03_e10_c10_u185	That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the salute)
s03_e10_c10_u186	Who's next? (goes over and stands behind Ross, who's feverishly writing on his form, and clears her throat to get his attention.)
s03_e10_c10_u187	Hi there!
s03_e10_c10_u188	Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
s03_e10_c10_u189	Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
s03_e10_c11_u190	Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
s03_e10_c11_u191	Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
s03_e10_c11_u192	(to Rachel, who's entering) Hey! How'd the interview go?
s03_e10_c11_u193	Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
s03_e10_c11_u194	Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That's not how that was supposed to come out.
s03_e10_c11_u195	This is the worst Christmas ever.
s03_e10_c11_u196	Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
s03_e10_c11_u197	I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. (points to her) Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.
s03_e10_c11_u198	That word was swans.
s03_e10_c12_u199	Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
s03_e10_c12_u200	Oh! Oh my God!
s03_e10_c12_u201	(jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!
s03_e10_c12_u202	You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!
s03_e10_c12_u203	It's like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
s03_e10_c12_u204	(answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!
s03_e10_c12_u205	Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
s03_e10_c12_u206	(hanging up the phone) I got the job!
s03_e10_c12_u207	That's great! Hey! Excellent!
s03_e10_c12_u208	Oh, God bless us, everyone.
s03_e10_c13_u209	Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)
s03_e10_c13_u210	(to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?
s03_e10_c13_u211	No.
s03_e10_c13_u212	Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room) Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
s03_e10_c14_u213	Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
s03_e10_c15_u214	I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in tinfoil.)
s03_e10_c15_u215	Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
s03_e10_c15_u216	Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by for mission countdown!
s03_e10_c15_u217	(simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!
s03_e10_c15_u218	I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
s03_e10_c15_u219	Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey's head.)
s01_e21_c01_u001	How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
s01_e21_c01_u002	I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
s01_e21_c01_u003	Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
s01_e21_c01_u004	I know. It's just such reckless spending.
s01_e21_c01_u005	I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
s01_e21_c01_u006	Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
s01_e21_c01_u007	That's me.
s01_e21_c01_u008	Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)
s01_e21_c01_u009	Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- (Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-
s01_e21_c01_u010	Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
s01_e21_c01_u011	Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
s01_e21_c01_u012	What? It's, it's just a phase.
s01_e21_c01_u013	Well, that's what we said about Joey...
s01_e21_c01_u014	Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
s01_e21_c01_u015	(Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
s01_e21_c01_u016	What?
s01_e21_c01_u017	Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
s01_e21_c02_u018	Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
s01_e21_c02_u019	This woman's living my life.
s01_e21_c02_u020	What?
s01_e21_c02_u021	She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
s01_e21_c02_u022	You're not an artist.
s01_e21_c02_u023	Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
s01_e21_c02_u024	Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
s01_e21_c02_u025	Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
s01_e21_c02_u026	(Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
s01_e21_c02_u027	Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
s01_e21_c02_u028	(Yawning) Nooo...
s01_e21_c02_u029	This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
s01_e21_c03_u030	How about Joey... Pepponi?
s01_e21_c03_u031	No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
s01_e21_c03_u032	Joey... Switzerland?
s01_e21_c03_u033	Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not.
s01_e21_c03_u034	Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
s01_e21_c03_u035	Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
s01_e21_c03_u036	Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
s01_e21_c03_u037	(Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
s01_e21_c03_u038	Might wanna try Joseph.
s01_e21_c03_u039	Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
s01_e21_c03_u040	Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
s01_e21_c04_u041	Hey.
s01_e21_c04_u042	Hey.
s01_e21_c04_u043	Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
s01_e21_c04_u044	What are you doing?
s01_e21_c04_u045	(Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tap class.
s01_e21_c04_u046	What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
s01_e21_c04_u047	This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
s01_e21_c04_u048	Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
s01_e21_c04_u049	This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
s01_e21_c05_u050	What d'you think?
s01_e21_c05_u051	Lotsa things.
s01_e21_c05_u052	Which one do you think she is?
s01_e21_c05_u053	May I help you?
s01_e21_c05_u054	Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
s01_e21_c05_u055	You don't observe a dance class. You dance
s01_e21_c05_u056	What does she mean?
s01_e21_c05_u057	I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance
s01_e21_c05_u058	Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
s01_e21_c05_u059	(To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
s01_e21_c05_u060	She could be you.
s01_e21_c05_u061	Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
s01_e21_c05_u062	Okay, I'm not getting this!
s01_e21_c05_u063	(Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!
s01_e21_c05_u064	Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
s01_e21_c05_u065	What? You just click when they click.
s01_e21_c05_u066	Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
s01_e21_c05_u067	Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
s01_e21_c05_u068	Great. It's gym class all over again.
s01_e21_c05_u069	Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
s01_e21_c05_u070	Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
s01_e21_c05_u071	It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
s01_e21_c05_u072	She's your partner.
s01_e21_c05_u073	Hi. I'm Monica.
s01_e21_c05_u074	Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
s01_e21_c05_u075	Yeah. It's Dutch.
s01_e21_c05_u076	You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks her something in Dutch)
s01_e21_c05_u077	Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
s01_e21_c05_u078	And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
s01_e21_c06_u079	(Mortified) Hi.
s01_e21_c06_u080	Where've you been?
s01_e21_c06_u081	At the vet.
s01_e21_c06_u082	She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
s01_e21_c06_u083	She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
s01_e21_c06_u084	(To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya.
s01_e21_c06_u085	She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
s01_e21_c06_u086	So what does this mean?
s01_e21_c06_u087	I'm gonna have to give him up.
s01_e21_c07_u088	I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
s01_e21_c07_u089	I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
s01_e21_c07_u090	I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
s01_e21_c07_u091	Isn't there any way you can keep him?
s01_e21_c07_u092	No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
s01_e21_c07_u093	How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
s01_e21_c07_u094	I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
s01_e21_c07_u095	Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
s01_e21_c07_u096	Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
s01_e21_c07_u097	Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
s01_e21_c07_u098	What?
s01_e21_c07_u099	Did you call the cops?
s01_e21_c07_u100	Nope. We took her to lunch.
s01_e21_c07_u101	Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
s01_e21_c07_u102	What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
s01_e21_c07_u103	Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
s01_e21_c07_u104	Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
s01_e21_c07_u105	...Take off their hats!
s01_e21_c07_u106	Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
s01_e21_c08_u107	No way. No way did you do this.
s01_e21_c08_u108	Monana was very brave.
s01_e21_c08_u109	It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
s01_e21_c08_u110	So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
s01_e21_c08_u111	...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
s01_e21_c08_u112	Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)
s01_e21_c08_u113	Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
s01_e21_c08_u114	'Scuse me?
s01_e21_c08_u115	There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
s01_e21_c08_u116	Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
s01_e21_c08_u117	Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
s01_e21_c08_u118	What?
s01_e21_c08_u119	Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
s01_e21_c08_u120	Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
s01_e21_c08_u121	I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
s01_e21_c08_u122	Uh-huh.
s01_e21_c08_u123	I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
s01_e21_c08_u124	Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
s01_e21_c09_u125	(Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To the others) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
s01_e21_c09_u126	I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
s01_e21_c09_u127	Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
s01_e21_c09_u128	Oh, somebody will.
s01_e21_c09_u129	(entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
s01_e21_c09_u130	You're kidding.
s01_e21_c09_u131	Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
s01_e21_c09_u132	Y'know, you'd think I would've.
s01_e21_c09_u133	Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
s01_e21_c09_u134	...Flame Boy.
s01_e21_c10_u135	Where exactly is your zoo?
s01_e21_c10_u136	Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
s01_e21_c10_u137	Yes.
s01_e21_c10_u138	Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
s01_e21_c10_u139	No-no, he's, he's very docile.
s01_e21_c10_u140	Even if he were... cornered?
s01_e21_c10_u141	Well I, I don't know. Why?
s01_e21_c10_u142	Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
s01_e21_c10_u143	He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
s01_e21_c10_u144	How about a hammer, or a small blade?
s01_e21_c10_u145	Why- why- why would he need a blade?
s01_e21_c10_u146	Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
s01_e21_c10_u147	We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
s01_e21_c10_u148	...He's in.
s01_e21_c10_u149	He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
s01_e21_c10_u150	You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
s01_e21_c11_u151	Yo- hooo!
s01_e21_c11_u152	Where the hell've you been?
s01_e21_c11_u153	Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
s01_e21_c11_u154	Are you drunk?!
s01_e21_c11_u155	Noooo! (Comes closer and whispers) I'm lying. I am so drunk.
s01_e21_c11_u156	Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
s01_e21_c11_u157	Monica? Monica!
s01_e21_c11_u158	Water rules!
s01_e21_c11_u159	Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
s01_e21_c11_u160	Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
s01_e21_c11_u161	Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
s01_e21_c11_u162	No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
s01_e21_c11_u163	Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
s01_e21_c11_u164	Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
s01_e21_c11_u165	What?
s01_e21_c11_u166	They've arrested Monica.
s01_e21_c12_u167	Hi.
s01_e21_c12_u168	Hey.
s01_e21_c12_u169	How are you?
s01_e21_c12_u170	I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
s01_e21_c12_u171	Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
s01_e21_c12_u172	That I was not expecting.
s01_e21_c12_u173	I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
s01_e21_c12_u174	Oh. Thanks.
s01_e21_c12_u175	No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
s01_e21_c12_u176	Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
s01_e21_c12_u177	I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
s01_e21_c12_u178	Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
s01_e21_c12_u179	Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
s01_e21_c12_u180	There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
s01_e21_c12_u181	Not necessarily...
s01_e21_c12_u182	Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
s01_e21_c12_u183	Um, I'm not actually Amish.
s01_e21_c12_u184	Really? Then why are you like that?
s01_e21_c13_u185	You by the door. In or out?
s01_e21_c13_u186	In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)
s01_e21_c13_u187	You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
s01_e21_c13_u188	Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
s01_e21_c14_u189	Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
s01_e21_c14_u190	Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
s01_e21_c14_u191	Oh!
s01_e21_c14_u192	Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
s01_e21_c14_u193	I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
s01_e21_c14_u194	Just, just say what you feel.
s01_e21_c14_u195	Marcel, I'm hungry.
s01_e21_c14_u196	That was good.
s01_e21_c14_u197	(Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
s01_e21_c14_u198	Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
s01_e21_c14_u199	Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
s01_e21_c15_u200	Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
s01_e21_c15_u201	Holden McGroin.
s05_e06_c01_u001	(entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
s05_e06_c01_u002	What?!
s05_e06_c01_u003	Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
s05_e06_c01_u004	Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
s05_e06_c01_u005	Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
s05_e06_c01_u006	Sorry.
s05_e06_c01_u007	Sorry.
s05_e06_c01_u008	(from the bedroom) I can hear that!
s05_e06_c01_u009	(To Chandler) Rachel's at work.
s05_e06_c01_u010	I can still hear you!
s05_e06_c02_u011	Hey!
s05_e06_c02_u012	Hey!
s05_e06_c02_u013	Hello!
s05_e06_c02_u014	Hey, what's that?
s05_e06_c02_u015	Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
s05_e06_c02_u016	Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)
s05_e06_c02_u017	Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
s05_e06_c02_u018	Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
s05_e06_c02_u019	Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen, I made that up!
s05_e06_c02_u020	(entering) Hey!
s05_e06_c02_u021	Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
s05_e06_c02_u022	How come? Everybody else does.
s05_e06_c02_u023	You can't.
s05_e06_c02_u024	What is that?
s05_e06_c02_u025	Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
s05_e06_c02_u026	(looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.
s05_e06_c02_u027	Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
s05_e06_c02_u028	So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
s05_e06_c02_u029	Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
s05_e06_c02_u030	I'll take it all.
s05_e06_c02_u031	Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
s05_e06_c02_u032	Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
s05_e06_c02_u033	Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
s05_e06_c02_u034	After what I did? Can you blame her?
s05_e06_c02_u035	Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
s05_e06_c02_u036	(after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
s05_e06_c02_u037	Now calm down Joey.
s05_e06_c02_u038	No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
s05_e06_c02_u039	Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
s05_e06_c02_u040	Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence
s05_e06_c02_u041	Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
s05_e06_c02_u042	No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
s05_e06_c03_u043	Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
s05_e06_c03_u044	Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
s05_e06_c03_u045	I want the little round waffles.
s05_e06_c03_u046	All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
s05_e06_c03_u047	Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
s05_e06_c03_u048	Arghhhh!!!!!!
s05_e06_c03_u049	Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
s05_e06_c04_u050	I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
s05_e06_c04_u051	I'll take it!
s05_e06_c04_u052	That might work! (She gives him the coat.)
s05_e06_c04_u053	Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right, what do you think?
s05_e06_c04_u054	You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
s05_e06_c04_u055	(on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)
s05_e06_c04_u056	What's the matter Ross?
s05_e06_c04_u057	Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
s05_e06_c04_u058	Why?
s05_e06_c04_u059	Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
s05_e06_c04_u060	That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.) Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
s05_e06_c04_u061	So you're really okay with this?
s05_e06_c04_u062	Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
s05_e06_c04_u063	Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
s05_e06_c04_u064	Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!
s05_e06_c04_u065	You guys! You guys!
s05_e06_c04_u066	We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
s05_e06_c04_u067	It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
s05_e06_c04_u068	And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
s05_e06_c04_u069	(proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
s05_e06_c04_u070	Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
s05_e06_c04_u071	Yeah!
s05_e06_c04_u072	Yeah, you fogged Danny.
s05_e06_c04_u073	Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
s05_e06_c04_u074	Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
s05_e06_c04_u075	Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
s05_e06_c05_u076	Yeah?
s05_e06_c05_u077	Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
s05_e06_c05_u078	We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
s05_e06_c05_u079	Okay.
s05_e06_c05_u080	Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
s05_e06_c05_u081	Okay.
s05_e06_c05_u082	Yesss?
s05_e06_c05_u083	Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
s05_e06_c05_u084	Yeah.
s05_e06_c05_u085	O-kay!
s05_e06_c05_u086	Wow! That guy is so rude!
s05_e06_c05_u087	Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
s05_e06_c05_u088	Well you did a little bit.
s05_e06_c05_u089	Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
s05_e06_c05_u090	I totally forgive you!
s05_e06_c05_u091	Really?
s05_e06_c05_u092	Yes!
s05_e06_c06_u093	Hey!
s05_e06_c06_u094	Hey!
s05_e06_c06_u095	So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
s05_e06_c06_u096	Crematorium Chris? Sure!
s05_e06_c06_u097	He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
s05_e06_c06_u098	Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
s05_e06_c06_u099	Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
s05_e06_c06_u100	What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
s05_e06_c06_u101	This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the mirror.) 'Cause I do.
s05_e06_c07_u102	(on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. (Hangs up.)
s05_e06_c07_u103	Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
s05_e06_c07_u104	No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
s05_e06_c07_u105	So, rocks.
s05_e06_c07_u106	I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. (Points.)
s05_e06_c07_u107	Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?
s05_e06_c07_u108	I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
s05_e06_c07_u109	Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
s05_e06_c07_u110	Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
s05_e06_c07_u111	You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
s05_e06_c07_u112	Why?
s05_e06_c07_u113	It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
s05_e06_c07_u114	What's going on?
s05_e06_c07_u115	We all hate Emily!
s05_e06_c07_u116	Nooo!!
s05_e06_c07_u117	No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
s05_e06_c07_u118	Yeah!
s05_e06_c07_u119	Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
s05_e06_c07_u120	Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
s05_e06_c07_u121	Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)
s05_e06_c07_u122	I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
s05_e06_c08_u123	God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
s05_e06_c08_u124	Oh, I know.
s05_e06_c08_u125	I kinda feel like it's my fault.
s05_e06_c08_u126	Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
s05_e06_c08_u127	Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)
s05_e06_c08_u128	Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
s05_e06_c08_u129	All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on her fur coat.)
s05_e06_c08_u130	Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
s05_e06_c08_u131	Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
s05_e06_c09_u132	Hi!
s05_e06_c09_u133	So you like the short hair better.
s05_e06_c09_u134	What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
s05_e06_c09_u135	I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
s05_e06_c09_u136	Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so-. Y'know.
s05_e06_c09_u137	Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
s05_e06_c09_u138	(shocked) What?
s05_e06_c09_u139	That's cool. Cool. (Starts to leave.)
s05_e06_c09_u140	What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
s05_e06_c09_u141	Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
s05_e06_c09_u142	So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
s05_e06_c09_u143	Do you?
s05_e06_c09_u144	Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
s05_e06_c09_u145	Okay. (Heads for his apartment.)
s05_e06_c09_u146	And stop saying that! I hate that!
s05_e06_c09_u147	Okay!
s05_e06_c09_u148	Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
s05_e06_c09_u149	The pizza-place across the street any good?
s05_e06_c09_u150	What?!
s05_e06_c09_u151	I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
s05_e06_c09_u152	Okay. Okay.
s05_e06_c09_u153	Stop saying that. I hate that.
s05_e06_c10_u154	Uh, Ross?
s05_e06_c10_u155	Are you still mad at us?
s05_e06_c10_u156	Yep.
s05_e06_c10_u157	Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
s05_e06_c10_u158	Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
s05_e06_c10_u159	Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
s05_e06_c10_u160	Yeah, we are so sorry.
s05_e06_c10_u161	(To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play but is stopped by-)
s05_e06_c10_u162	Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
s05_e06_c10_u163	Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
s05_e06_c10_u164	Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
s05_e06_c10_u165	Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
s05_e06_c10_u166	Yes! Exactly! And that's why
s05_e06_c10_u167	Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
s05_e06_c10_u168	Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
s05_e06_c10_u169	Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
s05_e06_c11_u170	Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
s05_e06_c11_u171	You do, huh?
s05_e06_c11_u172	Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone
s05_e06_c11_u173	What are you talking about?
s05_e06_c11_u174	(thinks) I'm not sure.
s05_e06_c11_u175	(entering) Hi!
s05_e06_c11_u176	Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
s05_e06_c11_u177	Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
s05_e06_c11_u178	How did that happen?
s05_e06_c11_u179	That yeti is one smooth talker.
s05_e06_c11_u180	I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
s05_e06_c11_u181	Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
s05_e06_c11_u182	No! Why?
s05_e06_c11_u183	Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really- I don't mind.
s05_e06_c11_u184	Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh- It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
s05_e06_c11_u185	Ross, I
s05_e06_c11_u186	RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
s05_e06_c11_u187	Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
s05_e06_c11_u188	All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor
s05_e06_c11_u189	Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
s05_e06_c11_u190	I haven't seen him in so long!
s05_e06_c11_u191	Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
s05_e06_c11_u192	Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
s05_e06_c11_u193	It's almost as if he knew.
s05_e06_c11_u194	I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)
s05_e06_c11_u195	Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.
s05_e06_c11_u196	Hi Emily!
s05_e06_c11_u197	Hi!
s05_e06_c11_u198	Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
s05_e06_c11_u199	Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
s05_e06_c11_u200	(laughs) Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
s05_e06_c11_u201	Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)
s05_e06_c11_u202	She's there?!
s05_e06_c11_u203	Oh yeah, there-there she is!
s05_e06_c11_u204	Yeah, yeah, she's here.
s05_e06_c11_u205	Ross, take me off speakerphone.
s05_e06_c11_u206	(on phone) Hi.
s05_e06_c11_u207	How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
s05_e06_c11_u208	(going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
s05_e06_c11_u209	You obviously can't keep away from her.
s05_e06_c11_u210	Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
s05_e06_c11_u211	I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
s05_e06_c11_u212	Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
s05_e06_c11_u213	You're right.
s05_e06_c11_u214	So, can you trust me?
s05_e06_c11_u215	No.
s05_e06_c11_u216	I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
s05_e06_c11_u217	How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
s05_e06_c11_u218	You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back inside.)
s05_e06_c11_u219	Well, I guess that's it.
s05_e06_c11_u220	Why, what happened?
s05_e06_c11_u221	What happened? What happened?
s05_e06_c11_u222	My marriage is over.
s05_e06_c11_u223	What?!
s05_e06_c11_u224	Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
s05_e06_c11_u225	Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
s05_e06_c11_u226	Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
s05_e06_c11_u227	Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
s05_e06_c12_u228	(to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here. (She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!
s03_e24_c01_u001	Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says You're in Sample. (He says it like urine sample.)
s03_e24_c01_u002	(entering) Hey.
s03_e24_c01_u003	Hey!
s03_e24_c01_u004	How'd it go with Pete?!
s03_e24_c01_u005	Tell us!
s03_e24_c01_u006	You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
s03_e24_c01_u007	I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we... (motions to the couch)
s03_e24_c01_u008	Yeah, could you scooch?
s03_e24_c01_u009	Yeah, move over just a little bit.
s03_e24_c01_u010	Keep on scooching.
s03_e24_c01_u011	So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
s03_e24_c01_u012	Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
s03_e24_c01_u013	What's the matter?
s03_e24_c01_u014	I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
s03_e24_c01_u015	How do you know?
s03_e24_c01_u016	Well y'know, he's got access.
s03_e24_c01_u017	Yeah.
s03_e24_c01_u018	Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
s03_e24_c01_u019	Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
s03_e24_c01_u020	That's the one.
s03_e24_c01_u021	All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
s03_e24_c01_u022	What happened?
s03_e24_c01_u023	(Robin is speaking loudly again) I...
s03_e24_c01_u024	Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
s03_e24_c01_u025	Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)
s03_e24_c01_u026	So it's-it's not heeled yet?
s03_e24_c01_u027	No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. (to Rachel) Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
s03_e24_c01_u028	Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
s03_e24_c01_u029	What is it, Tim?
s03_e24_c01_u030	It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
s03_e24_c01_u031	(to Billy) So you're the gynaecologist?
s03_e24_c01_u032	(to Joey) Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
s03_e24_c01_u033	(starting to cry) Ooh, (to Rachel) Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? (Rachel tries to grab one, but is to slow for his tastes.) Would you--Give me this thing (grabs the napkin holder from her.) all right!! Enough! (to Billy) And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! (gets up to leave) Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! (Billy follows him) Get away from me!!
s03_e24_c01_u034	Thomas, come back here! (they both leave)
s03_e24_c01_u035	So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
s03_e24_c01_u036	(pause) I have no idea.
s03_e24_c02_u037	So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
s03_e24_c02_u038	No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
s03_e24_c02_u039	He didn't ask me to marry him.
s03_e24_c02_u040	Ohh.
s03_e24_c02_u041	Well then definately don't take his name.
s03_e24_c02_u042	He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
s03_e24_c02_u043	Pete?!
s03_e24_c02_u044	Why?! What is it?
s03_e24_c02_u045	I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
s03_e24_c02_u046	(intrigued) Oh?!
s03_e24_c02_u047	Yeah, but without the costumes.
s03_e24_c02_u048	(disappointed) Oh.
s03_e24_c02_u049	And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
s03_e24_c02_u050	Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are: They're are no rules.
s03_e24_c02_u051	So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
s03_e24_c02_u052	Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
s03_e24_c02_u053	What's fish hooking?
s03_e24_c02_u054	Huh, what's fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross's mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic) Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
s03_e24_c02_u055	What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
s03_e24_c03_u056	So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get em! Huh? And remember, there is no I' in team.
s03_e24_c03_u057	Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
s03_e24_c03_u058	(to Chandler) You! Chuckles! What's your name?
s03_e24_c03_u059	Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
s03_e24_c03_u060	No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. (Chandler starts to leave) This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing! (smacks him on the butt, and Chandler leaves shocked.)
s03_e24_c04_u061	(on phone) That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.
s03_e24_c04_u062	Yes!!
s03_e24_c04_u063	All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)
s03_e24_c04_u064	(stunned) Dude, what are you doing?
s03_e24_c04_u065	Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
s03_e24_c04_u066	Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
s03_e24_c04_u067	Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
s03_e24_c04_u068	I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
s03_e24_c04_u069	Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)
s03_e24_c04_u070	Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
s03_e24_c04_u071	Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between em.
s03_e24_c04_u072	Okay, can we please go eat?
s03_e24_c04_u073	Yeah. What are we getting?
s03_e24_c04_u074	(to Chandler) Anything but stew.
s03_e24_c04_u075	All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
s03_e24_c04_u076	Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
s03_e24_c04_u077	(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
s03_e24_c04_u078	Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
s03_e24_c04_u079	Yeah.
s03_e24_c04_u080	Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
s03_e24_c04_u081	Oh, ah with who?
s03_e24_c04_u082	Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
s03_e24_c04_u083	Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
s03_e24_c04_u084	You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
s03_e24_c04_u085	Oh! (laughs) That's fine.
s03_e24_c04_u086	Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)
s03_e24_c05_u087	You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
s03_e24_c05_u088	I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
s03_e24_c05_u089	It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
s03_e24_c05_u090	(entering) Hi!
s03_e24_c05_u091	Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey.
s03_e24_c05_u092	All right, on the table. (Pete gets on the table for his rubdown)
s03_e24_c05_u093	Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, cause I kinda like you.
s03_e24_c05_u094	Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. (Hoshi yells at him in Chinese) A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
s03_e24_c05_u095	Promise me you'll be careful.
s03_e24_c05_u096	I promise.
s03_e24_c05_u097	Hey, are we still on for tonight?
s03_e24_c05_u098	Yeah.
s03_e24_c05_u099	Okay, good, cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
s03_e24_c05_u100	No! No boom-boom before big fight!
s03_e24_c05_u101	How bout just a boom?
s03_e24_c06_u102	(to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
s03_e24_c06_u103	Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
s03_e24_c06_u104	Hi!
s03_e24_c06_u105	This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You're Bonnie?
s03_e24_c06_u106	I can show you an ID if you want?
s03_e24_c06_u107	Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
s03_e24_c06_u108	Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
s03_e24_c06_u109	Oh, that must be it.
s03_e24_c06_u110	(to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.
s03_e24_c06_u111	Thanks! You too.
s03_e24_c06_u112	(to Phoebe) You said she was bald.
s03_e24_c06_u113	Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
s03_e24_c06_u114	How could you not tell me that she has hair?
s03_e24_c06_u115	I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
s03_e24_c06_u116	(looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
s03_e24_c06_u117	Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
s03_e24_c06_u118	Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
s03_e24_c06_u119	Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
s03_e24_c06_u120	Why, does she have a bad personality?
s03_e24_c06_u121	Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
s03_e24_c07_u122	Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slides over making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. (Chandler goes over) Wham! (slaps him on the butt) Good one. That was a good one. (to a couple of Chandler's co-workers) Keep at it team. (goes into his office)
s03_e24_c07_u123	(to his co-workers) What is with him?
s03_e24_c07_u124	With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
s03_e24_c07_u125	We never get smacked.
s03_e24_c07_u126	Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
s03_e24_c07_u127	Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
s03_e24_c07_u128	I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
s03_e24_c07_u129	(coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
s03_e24_c07_u130	No sir.
s03_e24_c07_u131	There you go. (smacks him on the butt)
s03_e24_c08_u132	(walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!
s03_e24_c08_u133	God Ross, what is that?
s03_e24_c08_u134	Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
s03_e24_c08_u135	From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
s03_e24_c08_u136	I love you, Pete!!!
s03_e24_c08_u137	And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
s03_e24_c08_u138	(going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
s03_e24_c08_u139	Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
s03_e24_c08_u140	Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
s03_e24_c08_u141	All right! You go get him! Let's go!
s03_e24_c08_u142	Here we go gentlemen, here we go! (to Tank Abbott) Are you ready? (He nods, and takes out his teeth) (to Pete) Are you ready? (Pete nods, Yes.) Let's get it on!!
s03_e24_c08_u143	Uh-oh.
s03_e24_c09_u144	Hey! (she sits down next to him) It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
s03_e24_c09_u145	It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant You suck!
s03_e24_c09_u146	I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
s03_e24_c09_u147	What, look back?
s03_e24_c09_u148	Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
s03_e24_c09_u149	Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
s03_e24_c09_u150	Well, no. But...
s03_e24_c09_u151	Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
s03_e24_c09_u152	That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
s03_e24_c09_u153	Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
s03_e24_c09_u154	You didn't know that already?
s03_e24_c09_u155	Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
s03_e24_c09_u156	Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.
s03_e24_c09_u157	Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
s03_e24_c09_u158	Yeah. That-that was the problem.
s03_e24_c10_u159	(joining them) Hey.
s03_e24_c10_u160	Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
s03_e24_c10_u161	Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
s03_e24_c10_u162	Hot dog?
s03_e24_c10_u163	Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I'm really nervous. (Ross gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)
s03_e24_c10_u164	So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
s03_e24_c10_u165	What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
s03_e24_c10_u166	Ohh, that's too bad!
s03_e24_c10_u167	No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
s03_e24_c10_u168	Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
s03_e24_c10_u169	Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
s03_e24_c10_u170	Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
s03_e24_c10_u171	(joining them) Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
s03_e24_c10_u172	Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
s03_e24_c10_u173	(sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight's starting!
s03_e24_c10_u174	Okay, we'll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
s03_e24_c10_u175	Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
s03_e24_c10_u176	(sticking his head out the window) Fight's over!
s03_e24_c11_u177	Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!
s03_e24_c11_u178	(turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?
s03_e24_c11_u179	No, I ah, I didn't do them.
s03_e24_c11_u180	Oh, you forgot?
s03_e24_c11_u181	No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
s03_e24_c11_u182	Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. (laughs) That's okay, you're still my number one guy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!
s03_e24_c11_u183	Doug!!
s03_e24_c11_u184	Hmm.
s03_e24_c11_u185	I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
s03_e24_c11_u186	Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
s03_e24_c11_u187	No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
s03_e24_c11_u188	Oh?
s03_e24_c11_u189	Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
s03_e24_c11_u190	Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
s03_e24_c11_u191	Okay. (he starts to leave)
s03_e24_c11_u192	Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out) Ahhhhhhh!
s03_e24_c11_u193	Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)
s03_e24_c12_u194	Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
s03_e24_c12_u195	(seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
s03_e24_c12_u196	No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
s03_e24_c12_u197	Phoebe! (goes back to the window)
s03_e24_c12_u198	(looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
s03_e24_c12_u199	Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
s03_e24_c12_u200	Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
s03_e24_c12_u201	Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
s03_e24_c12_u202	You said it was okay!
s03_e24_c12_u203	You said she was bald!!
s03_e24_c12_u204	What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
s03_e24_c12_u205	Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
s03_e24_c12_u206	Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
s03_e24_c12_u207	(quietly) Yes.
s03_e24_c12_u208	Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
s03_e24_c12_u209	Yes.
s03_e24_c12_u210	So?
s03_e24_c12_u211	I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)
s03_e24_c12_u212	(sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.
s03_e24_c12_u213	What?
s03_e24_c12_u214	Oh, we killed them all.
s03_e24_c12_u215	Oh!
s03_e24_c13_u216	It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
s03_e24_c13_u217	Please tell me you're stopping now.
s03_e24_c13_u218	I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. (stands up and starts swinging his arms) See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
s03_e24_c13_u219	You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
s03_e24_c13_u220	I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
s03_e24_c13_u221	Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
s03_e24_c13_u222	Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
s03_e24_c13_u223	Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
s03_e24_c13_u224	Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
s03_e24_c13_u225	Then I've gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)
s03_e24_c13_u226	Mon-Monica?
s03_e24_c13_u227	Yes?
s03_e24_c13_u228	Could you leave a note? Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow. (She leaves.)
s03_e24_c14_u229	So, in conclusion, the lines all go up (points to the chart), so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. (They start to leave) Phil! Nice job. (smacks him on the butt) Stevens! Way to go! (smacks him on the butt) Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! (smacks him on the butt) (Chandler walks up) Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya. (he shakes his hand)
s03_e24_c14_u230	Thank you, sir.
s03_e24_c14_u231	(coming back in) Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
s03_e24_c14_u232	Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him on the butt) (to Chandler) Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
s03_e24_c14_u233	No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
s03_e24_c14_u234	Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
s03_e24_c14_u235	Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
s03_e24_c14_u236	Now get on out of here, you! (smacks him on the butt)
s03_e24_c15_u237	Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
s03_e24_c15_u238	Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
s03_e24_c15_u239	Oh, I can't watch this. (turns her eyes away)
s03_e24_c15_u240	Check it out, he's winning! (to Monica) Pete's winning!
s03_e24_c15_u241	Really?!
s03_e24_c15_u242	No-o-o!!
s03_e24_c15_u243	Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
s03_e24_c15_u244	Oh! Oh! (they all recoil in horror)
s03_e24_c15_u245	Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
s03_e24_c15_u246	Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
s03_e24_c15_u247	Ohh!! (they all start pointing at the screen)
s09_e10_c01_u001	...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
s09_e10_c01_u002	(impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
s09_e10_c01_u003	(smiling) Uh-huh.
s09_e10_c01_u004	(coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
s09_e10_c01_u005	I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
s09_e10_c01_u006	You're really not coming back?
s09_e10_c01_u007	Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
s09_e10_c01_u008	It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
s09_e10_c01_u009	So, who does?
s09_e10_c01_u010	Oh, I like my job.
s09_e10_c01_u011	I *love* my job.
s09_e10_c01_u012	Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
s09_e10_c01_u013	I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
s09_e10_c01_u014	I'm sorry, I won't be here.
s09_e10_c01_u015	It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
s09_e10_c01_u016	Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.
s09_e10_c01_u017	(shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
s09_e10_c01_u018	Did I not mention that?
s09_e10_c01_u019	No!
s09_e10_c01_u020	(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)
s09_e10_c02_u021	All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
s09_e10_c02_u022	Hey!
s09_e10_c02_u023	Hey.
s09_e10_c02_u024	Hey. Where've you been?
s09_e10_c02_u025	I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham. (She turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)
s09_e10_c02_u026	(to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
s09_e10_c02_u027	My kid's in a play right now.
s09_e10_c02_u028	Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
s09_e10_c02_u029	(reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
s09_e10_c02_u030	Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
s09_e10_c02_u031	*Now* it feels like Christmas.
s09_e10_c02_u032	I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
s09_e10_c02_u033	You can come to my house!
s09_e10_c02_u034	Haha, no thanks!
s09_e10_c02_u035	That was a nice pep-talk.
s09_e10_c02_u036	Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
s09_e10_c02_u037	So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
s09_e10_c02_u038	Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
s09_e10_c03_u039	So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. (singing:)
s09_e10_c04_u040	Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
s09_e10_c04_u041	I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
s09_e10_c04_u042	Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
s09_e10_c04_u043	We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
s09_e10_c04_u044	What? That's terrible!
s09_e10_c04_u045	No-no, we do it every year!
s09_e10_c04_u046	Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
s09_e10_c04_u047	No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
s09_e10_c04_u048	Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
s09_e10_c04_u049	No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
s09_e10_c04_u050	Oh no, we have to!
s09_e10_c04_u051	No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
s09_e10_c04_u052	Well then, you should look with us.
s09_e10_c04_u053	Why?
s09_e10_c04_u054	Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
s09_e10_c04_u055	No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
s09_e10_c04_u056	Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah.
s09_e10_c04_u057	Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
s09_e10_c04_u058	If I help, we can find 'em faster!
s09_e10_c04_u059	That's right!
s09_e10_c04_u060	Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
s09_e10_c04_u061	Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
s09_e10_c04_u062	Oh.
s09_e10_c04_u063	Ooh, who's it for?
s09_e10_c04_u064	(Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) "Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
s09_e10_c05_u065	Rach, these are for you.
s09_e10_c05_u066	Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
s09_e10_c05_u067	No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
s09_e10_c05_u068	OK, Pheebs, your turn.
s09_e10_c05_u069	Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
s09_e10_c05_u070	Uh-huh.
s09_e10_c05_u071	You guuuyys.
s09_e10_c05_u072	And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
s09_e10_c05_u073	You got me a cola drink?
s09_e10_c05_u074	And, a lemon lime.
s09_e10_c05_u075	Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
s09_e10_c05_u076	And last but not least.
s09_e10_c05_u077	They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
s09_e10_c06_u078	Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
s09_e10_c06_u079	Yeah!
s09_e10_c06_u080	Come on Ben.
s09_e10_c06_u081	Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
s09_e10_c06_u082	(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
s09_e10_c06_u083	Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
s09_e10_c06_u084	What are you doing here, Santa?
s09_e10_c06_u085	Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
s09_e10_c06_u086	I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
s09_e10_c06_u087	What?
s09_e10_c06_u088	Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
s09_e10_c06_u089	(to Chandler) What are you doing?
s09_e10_c06_u090	You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
s09_e10_c06_u091	Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
s09_e10_c06_u092	Why?
s09_e10_c06_u093	Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
s09_e10_c06_u094	But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
s09_e10_c06_u095	I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
s09_e10_c06_u096	Fine, I'll give the suit back.
s09_e10_c06_u097	(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)
s09_e10_c06_u098	Santa? Really?
s09_e10_c06_u099	Yeah, is that okay?
s09_e10_c06_u100	Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
s09_e10_c06_u101	No.
s09_e10_c06_u102	Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)
s09_e10_c07_u103	You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
s09_e10_c07_u104	Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
s09_e10_c07_u105	Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?
s09_e10_c07_u106	Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
s09_e10_c07_u107	Ah. Thanks.
s09_e10_c07_u108	Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
s09_e10_c07_u109	Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.
s09_e10_c08_u110	Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
s09_e10_c08_u111	(simultaneously) Merry Christmas! (except for Phoebe...)
s09_e10_c08_u112	(simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
s09_e10_c08_u113	Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
s09_e10_c08_u114	So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
s09_e10_c08_u115	Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
s09_e10_c08_u116	Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
s09_e10_c08_u117	It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
s09_e10_c08_u118	Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
s09_e10_c08_u119	I sent them home.
s09_e10_c08_u120	Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
s09_e10_c08_u121	Uhh, uh...
s09_e10_c08_u122	(in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!
s09_e10_c08_u123	I don't know!
s09_e10_c08_u124	(in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!
s09_e10_c08_u125	I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
s09_e10_c08_u126	What does she do there?
s09_e10_c08_u127	Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
s09_e10_c08_u128	She did WHAT?
s09_e10_c08_u129	BE-LOW me!
s09_e10_c08_u130	Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
s09_e10_c08_u131	*What*??
s09_e10_c08_u132	Well, she... she didn't win...
s09_e10_c08_u133	Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
s09_e10_c08_u134	Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
s09_e10_c08_u135	(interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!
s09_e10_c08_u136	Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
s09_e10_c08_u137	Okay.
s09_e10_c08_u138	I'm serious!
s09_e10_c08_u139	Okay!
s09_e10_c08_u140	Merry Christmas.
s09_e10_c08_u141	Merry Christmas.
s09_e10_c08_u142	Merry Christmas, you guys!
s09_e10_c08_u143	(simultaneously) Yeah, Merry... Christmas. (again, Phoebe...)
s09_e10_c08_u144	(simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab.
s09_e10_c09_u145	(hanging up the phone) The wife says "Hi!".
s09_e10_c09_u146	Ah. Fun conversation?
s09_e10_c09_u147	Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
s09_e10_c09_u148	Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? (She gets hold of Chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)
s09_e10_c09_u149	This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
s09_e10_c10_u150	Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)
s09_e10_c10_u151	(laughs) ...Missy?
s09_e10_c10_u152	I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
s09_e10_c10_u153	You are to me... (She gets closer again, putting her arms around his torso.)
s09_e10_c10_u154	(flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!
s09_e10_c10_u155	So? I'm married. (Showing him the ring on her finger.)
s09_e10_c10_u156	I'm *happily* married.
s09_e10_c10_u157	Oh. - What's *that* like?
s09_e10_c10_u158	Right. So, I'm sorry...
s09_e10_c10_u159	Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?
s09_e10_c10_u160	Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
s09_e10_c10_u161	Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?
s09_e10_c11_u162	I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
s09_e10_c11_u163	Really?
s09_e10_c11_u164	You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
s09_e10_c11_u165	Well, not anymore.
s09_e10_c11_u166	But we don't do that.
s09_e10_c11_u167	I know, I just thought it would be fun.
s09_e10_c11_u168	How drunk are you?
s09_e10_c11_u169	Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
s09_e10_c11_u170	(thinks) That's the perfect amount!
s09_e10_c11_u171	Okay!
s09_e10_c11_u172	(breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?
s09_e10_c11_u173	What?
s09_e10_c11_u174	This doesn't feel weird!
s09_e10_c11_u175	I know.
s09_e10_c11_u176	You're a really good kisser.
s09_e10_c11_u177	Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
s09_e10_c11_u178	Hm-hmm!
s09_e10_c11_u179	Okay!
s09_e10_c11_u180	Wow! You are really fast!
s09_e10_c11_u181	It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
s09_e10_c11_u182	We're gonna see each other naked.
s09_e10_c11_u183	Yep!
s09_e10_c11_u184	Do you wanna do it at the same time?
s09_e10_c11_u185	Count of three?
s09_e10_c11_u186	One!
s09_e10_c11_u187	Two!
s09_e10_c11_u188	Two!
s09_e10_c11_u189	Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)
s09_e10_c11_u190	Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
s09_e10_c11_u191	Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
s09_e10_c11_u192	Eh! (They start making out again)
s09_e10_c12_u193	So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
s09_e10_c12_u194	Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
s09_e10_c12_u195	Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
s09_e10_c12_u196	I think you're better than you think you are.
s09_e10_c12_u197	Really? Okay, so...
s09_e10_c12_u198	(interrupting) Know when to stop.
s09_e10_c12_u199	Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
s09_e10_c12_u200	Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around:) Don't do the dance.
s09_e10_c12_u201	Right!
s09_e10_c13_u202	I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
s09_e10_c13_u203	Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
s09_e10_c13_u204	You're so efficient. I love you!
s09_e10_c13_u205	Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
s09_e10_c13_u206	No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
s09_e10_c13_u207	Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
s09_e10_c13_u208	That'll work!
s09_e10_c13_u209	I don't think so.
s09_e10_c13_u210	Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
s09_e10_c13_u211	(looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
s09_e10_c13_u212	That's stealing!
s09_e10_c13_u213	No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
s09_e10_c13_u214	Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
s09_e10_c13_u215	Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
s09_e10_c14_u216	Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
s09_e10_c14_u217	Ehh.
s09_e10_c14_u218	Eh, you work for that.
s09_e10_c14_u219	Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
s09_e10_c14_u220	You do?!
s09_e10_c14_u221	Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
s09_e10_c14_u222	Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
s09_e10_c14_u223	Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
s09_e10_c14_u224	You thought about that?
s09_e10_c14_u225	Yeah.
s09_e10_c14_u226	How many kids were we gonna have?
s09_e10_c14_u227	Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
s09_e10_c14_u228	What else did you think about?
s09_e10_c14_u229	Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
s09_e10_c14_u230	(laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
s09_e10_c14_u231	Sure you do.
s09_e10_c14_u232	No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
s09_e10_c14_u233	You sure?
s09_e10_c14_u234	Uh-hmm.
s09_e10_c14_u235	I love you so much.
s09_e10_c14_u236	I love you. (They kiss.)
s09_e10_c15_u237	(opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!
s09_e10_c15_u238	Really? You're not gonna return it?
s09_e10_c15_u239	Well, not this second!
s09_e10_c15_u240	(at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
s09_e10_c15_u241	Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
s09_e10_c15_u242	Wow, it really is!
s09_e10_c15_u243	"Wendy" is a fat girl name.
s09_e10_c15_u244	Aren't we done with that?
s09_e10_c15_u245	Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
s09_e10_c15_u246	Hey!
s09_e10_c15_u247	Oh my god...
s09_e10_c15_u248	Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
s09_e10_c15_u249	What are you doing here?
s09_e10_c15_u250	I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
s09_e10_c15_u251	Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
s09_e10_c15_u252	Monica.
s09_e10_c15_u253	Got ya. (blinks an eye)
s09_e10_c15_u254	I never want to leave you again!
s09_e10_c15_u255	But I thought if you left, you get fired.
s09_e10_c15_u256	Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
s09_e10_c15_u257	What?
s09_e10_c15_u258	What, you, you really quit your job?
s09_e10_c15_u259	Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
s09_e10_c15_u260	What do you really want to do?
s09_e10_c15_u261	(realizing) I have *not* thought this through!
s09_e10_c15_u262	Oh my god!
s09_e10_c15_u263	I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
s09_e10_c15_u264	No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
s09_e10_c15_u265	Thanks!
s09_e10_c15_u266	Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
s09_e10_c15_u267	(flattered) Ahh...
s09_e10_c15_u268	Now give me my real gift.
s09_e10_c15_u269	(to Chandler) Thank you.
s09_e10_c15_u270	(to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)
s09_e10_c15_u271	Oh, hey...
s09_e10_c15_u272	(reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
s09_e10_c15_u273	Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
s09_e10_c15_u274	I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
s09_e10_c15_u275	Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
s09_e10_c15_u276	I don't have a *job*!
s09_e10_c16_u277	Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
s09_e10_c16_u278	You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
s04_e15_c01_u001	Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
s04_e15_c01_u002	Chandler, there's a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)
s04_e15_c01_u003	That's a mailman! That's our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?
s04_e15_c01_u004	Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
s04_e15_c01_u005	Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
s04_e15_c01_u006	Hmm.
s04_e15_c02_u007	Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
s04_e15_c02_u008	Ohh, Nothing.
s04_e15_c02_u009	Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
s04_e15_c02_u010	I know what it did! Nothing.
s04_e15_c02_u011	They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
s04_e15_c02_u012	Like this. (Shrugs)
s04_e15_c02_u013	Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
s04_e15_c02_u014	Sure! It flushes it.
s04_e15_c02_u015	Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
s04_e15_c02_u016	(entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!
s04_e15_c02_u017	Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)
s04_e15_c02_u018	Guess who we ran into today?!
s04_e15_c02_u019	Janice?!
s04_e15_c02_u020	Isn't this amazing?
s04_e15_c02_u021	How have you been?
s04_e15_c02_u022	Oh well, I'm divorced.
s04_e15_c02_u023	Ohhh, wow.
s04_e15_c02_u024	Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)
s04_e15_c02_u025	And there it is.
s04_e15_c02_u026	I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! (to Chandler) And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
s04_e15_c02_u027	Okay. Bye.
s04_e15_c02_u028	Bye.
s04_e15_c02_u029	Bye.
s04_e15_c02_u030	Bye.
s04_e15_c02_u031	Bye.
s04_e15_c02_u032	Bye.
s04_e15_c02_u033	B-bye!
s04_e15_c02_u034	Bye-bye.
s04_e15_c02_u035	Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it's closed) I can't stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)
s04_e15_c02_u036	What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
s04_e15_c02_u037	Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
s04_e15_c02_u038	So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
s04_e15_c02_u039	Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
s04_e15_c02_u040	You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
s04_e15_c02_u041	(standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)
s04_e15_c02_u042	Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around and then back at Joey.) I'm tellin' ya!
s04_e15_c03_u043	I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
s04_e15_c03_u044	No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
s04_e15_c03_u045	Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
s04_e15_c03_u046	No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. (Introducing them) Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
s04_e15_c03_u047	Hey, mate.
s04_e15_c03_u048	How are ya man?
s04_e15_c03_u049	Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!
s04_e15_c03_u050	So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
s04_e15_c03_u051	Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
s04_e15_c03_u052	Oh my God. I think you're right.
s04_e15_c03_u053	(puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
s04_e15_c03_u054	Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)
s04_e15_c03_u055	Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it (In an English accent) football?
s04_e15_c03_u056	We were playing rugby.
s04_e15_c03_u057	In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
s04_e15_c03_u058	(laughs) Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
s04_e15_c03_u059	What's ah, what's so funny about that?
s04_e15_c03_u060	Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
s04_e15_c03_u061	Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so
s04_e15_c03_u062	So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
s04_e15_c03_u063	Cheers!
s04_e15_c03_u064	Cheers!
s04_e15_c04_u065	Oh boy, I just love to sing!
s04_e15_c04_u066	Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
s04_e15_c04_u067	Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)
s04_e15_c04_u068	(laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship
s04_e15_c04_u069	I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
s04_e15_c04_u070	Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
s04_e15_c04_u071	Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
s04_e15_c04_u072	I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
s04_e15_c04_u073	Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?
s04_e15_c04_u074	No! No! Not, Paris.
s04_e15_c04_u075	Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
s04_e15_c04_u076	Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
s04_e15_c04_u077	When?
s04_e15_c04_u078	I don't know exactly.
s04_e15_c04_u079	Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
s04_e15_c04_u080	But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
s04_e15_c05_u081	Done?
s04_e15_c05_u082	Yep!
s04_e15_c05_u083	(entering, with Joey) Hey!
s04_e15_c05_u084	Hey! What's up?
s04_e15_c05_u085	This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
s04_e15_c05_u086	(to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.
s04_e15_c05_u087	Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
s04_e15_c05_u088	Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it's Joey.)
s04_e15_c05_u089	It's coming from Joey!
s04_e15_c05_u090	Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
s04_e15_c06_u091	Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
s04_e15_c06_u092	Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
s04_e15_c06_u093	Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
s04_e15_c06_u094	(entering) Hey there Ross!
s04_e15_c06_u095	(shocked) Hey!
s04_e15_c06_u096	(whispering to Ross) Janice.
s04_e15_c06_u097	Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
s04_e15_c06_u098	Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
s04_e15_c06_u099	Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
s04_e15_c06_u100	Hey-hey, what's going on?
s04_e15_c06_u101	Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
s04_e15_c06_u102	Thanks for telling me!
s04_e15_c06_u103	I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
s04_e15_c06_u104	Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
s04_e15_c06_u105	(leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
s04_e15_c06_u106	Yeah, I know, I do that cause it makes me look taller.
s04_e15_c06_u107	Okay, Chandler, come on!
s04_e15_c06_u108	(to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!
s04_e15_c06_u109	Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
s04_e15_c06_u110	Hey, I can handle it! All right?
s04_e15_c06_u111	Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
s04_e15_c06_u112	That's cause-cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
s04_e15_c06_u113	(pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
s04_e15_c06_u114	And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
s04_e15_c06_u115	Ross! (Laughs) They're gonna kill you!
s04_e15_c06_u116	Well, why are you doing this anyway?
s04_e15_c06_u117	Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
s04_e15_c06_u118	You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. (Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
s04_e15_c06_u119	Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
s04_e15_c06_u120	(starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
s04_e15_c06_u121	All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's-Chandler!
s04_e15_c06_u122	(from his bedroom) Thanks!
s04_e15_c06_u123	Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)
s04_e15_c06_u124	Oh!
s04_e15_c06_u125	Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
s04_e15_c07_u126	Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy (Points). And that one-Dude! They're all huge!
s04_e15_c07_u127	They don't look any bigger than me!
s04_e15_c07_u128	Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
s04_e15_c07_u129	I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
s04_e15_c07_u130	All right.
s04_e15_c07_u131	Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.)
s04_e15_c07_u132	(to the player) Hi.
s04_e15_c07_u133	Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.
s04_e15_c07_u134	Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. (Joey and Phoebe don't know what he's talking about.) Y'know, Red Ross!
s04_e15_c07_u135	I totally don't know what you're talking about.
s04_e15_c07_u136	Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
s04_e15_c07_u137	No.
s04_e15_c07_u138	You'll see.
s04_e15_c07_u139	Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
s04_e15_c07_u140	You don't say! (We see Ross who is hopping about with the ball and spikes it in his face.)
s04_e15_c07_u141	(to Ross) Good luck, babe.
s04_e15_c07_u142	Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!
s04_e15_c07_u143	Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
s04_e15_c07_u144	JOEY!!!!!!
s04_e15_c08_u145	You-are-not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
s04_e15_c08_u146	He asked you out?!
s04_e15_c08_u147	No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
s04_e15_c08_u148	Saucy!
s04_e15_c08_u149	(refers to the table) What are these?
s04_e15_c08_u150	Electrical plans for the building.
s04_e15_c08_u151	Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
s04_e15_c08_u152	I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
s04_e15_c08_u153	Wow! If only more people knew.
s04_e15_c09_u154	Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
s04_e15_c09_u155	Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
s04_e15_c09_u156	Well, we're really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
s04_e15_c09_u157	On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
s04_e15_c09_u158	Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here.") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
s04_e15_c09_u159	One ticket to Yemen?
s04_e15_c09_u160	Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
s04_e15_c09_u161	I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
s04_e15_c09_u162	What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
s04_e15_c09_u163	Are you travelling with a child?
s04_e15_c09_u164	No. All right, y'know what, she's (Points to Janice) gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
s04_e15_c09_u165	Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
s04_e15_c09_u166	What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
s04_e15_c09_u167	(to the ticket agent) American Express?
s04_e15_c10_u168	I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
s04_e15_c10_u169	No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so
s04_e15_c10_u170	That's just halftime, there's more of this.
s04_e15_c10_u171	Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
s04_e15_c10_u172	Right.
s04_e15_c10_u173	(to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
s04_e15_c10_u174	Okay.
s04_e15_c10_u175	Thanks. (When she's gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
s04_e15_c10_u176	Oh, poor baby.
s04_e15_c10_u177	(to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
s04_e15_c10_u178	Ross, they are killing you out there!
s04_e15_c10_u179	(whines "No.") That's not true!
s04_e15_c10_u180	She's right! You have to stop!
s04_e15_c10_u181	What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
s04_e15_c10_u182	Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
s04_e15_c10_u183	I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
s04_e15_c10_u184	All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
s04_e15_c10_u185	No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
s04_e15_c10_u186	No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
s04_e15_c10_u187	I like that.
s04_e15_c10_u188	Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
s04_e15_c10_u189	Huh?
s04_e15_c10_u190	One swift kick and he'll back off.
s04_e15_c10_u191	All right, bad ankle, got it!
s04_e15_c10_u192	And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
s04_e15_c10_u193	Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
s04_e15_c10_u194	And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
s04_e15_c10_u195	But-but, Liam's on my team.
s04_e15_c10_u196	I don't care! You just get him!
s04_e15_c10_u197	I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a madman.)
s04_e15_c10_u198	The Red Ross! Okay.
s04_e15_c11_u199	Hey!
s04_e15_c11_u200	Hi!
s04_e15_c11_u201	(noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren't there originally.) What-what are-what are these?
s04_e15_c11_u202	Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
s04_e15_c11_u203	No-no-no, no!
s04_e15_c11_u204	I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
s04_e15_c11_u205	Oh my God! Look at this!
s04_e15_c11_u206	Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
s04_e15_c11_u207	I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
s04_e15_c11_u208	I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
s04_e15_c11_u209	And did you?!
s04_e15_c11_u210	No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
s04_e15_c11_u211	But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
s04_e15_c11_u212	Oh my God.
s04_e15_c11_u213	Hello darling.
s04_e15_c11_u214	Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
s04_e15_c12_u215	Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
s04_e15_c12_u216	Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
s04_e15_c12_u217	Yeah, sure.
s04_e15_c12_u218	No, not you. (Emily gets it.)
s04_e15_c12_u219	Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
s04_e15_c12_u220	Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)
s04_e15_c12_u221	You were amazing out there.
s04_e15_c12_u222	Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
s04_e15_c12_u223	Oh my God!
s04_e15_c12_u224	I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
s04_e15_c12_u225	You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
s04_e15_c12_u226	Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
s04_e15_c12_u227	I think you've got concussion.
s04_e15_c12_u228	No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
s04_e15_c12_u229	You're welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he winces.) I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
s04_e15_c12_u230	It's worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
s04_e15_c13_u231	(on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
s04_e15_c13_u232	Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
s04_e15_c13_u233	Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
s04_e15_c13_u234	Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
s04_e15_c13_u235	Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
s04_e15_c13_u236	Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
s04_e15_c13_u237	Chandler?
s04_e15_c13_u238	No!
s04_e15_c13_u239	Chandler!
s04_e15_c13_u240	Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
s04_e15_c13_u241	No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
s04_e15_c13_u242	Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
s04_e15_c14_u243	All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
s04_e15_c14_u244	Thank God.
s04_e15_c14_u245	I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
s04_e15_c14_u246	See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.
s06_e15_c01_u001	Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
s06_e15_c01_u002	Oh my God!
s06_e15_c01_u003	Wow!
s06_e15_c01_u004	(To Ross) What is the matter with you?!
s06_e15_c01_u005	No! Barry and Mindy.
s06_e15_c01_u006	Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel) Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
s06_e15_c01_u007	Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
s06_e15_c01_u008	Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
s06_e15_c01_u009	Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
s06_e15_c01_u010	Why did they get divorced?
s06_e15_c01_u011	Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
s06_e15_c01_u012	I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
s06_e15_c01_u013	Which time?
s06_e15_c01_u014	The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
s06_e15_c01_u015	(starts to imagine it) I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
s06_e15_c01_u016	I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. (That's karate, he's just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
s06_e15_c01_u017	Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
s06_e15_c01_u018	And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
s06_e15_c01_u019	Sure I would!
s06_e15_c01_u020	What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
s06_e15_c01_u021	No, I just think Monica was that fat.
s06_e15_c01_u022	Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
s06_e15_c01_u023	What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
s06_e15_c01_u024	What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
s06_e15_c01_u025	What?!
s06_e15_c01_u026	Merrill Lynch?
s06_e15_c01_u027	Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
s06_e15_c01_u028	Well why didn't you take the job?
s06_e15_c01_u029	Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
s06_e15_c01_u030	Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
s06_e15_c02_u031	(recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?
s06_e15_c02_u032	(gasps) Rob Tillman!
s06_e15_c02_u033	No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
s06_e15_c02_u034	Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
s06_e15_c02_u035	No, no-no, Ross Geller.
s06_e15_c02_u036	Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
s06_e15_c02_u037	Yeah. Right.
s06_e15_c02_u038	Wow! How are you?!
s06_e15_c02_u039	Good-good, I'm-I'm married. (Shows her his ring.)
s06_e15_c02_u040	Ohh! Me too!
s06_e15_c02_u041	Is-isn't it the best?
s06_e15_c02_u042	Oh, it's the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) So, umm how's Monica?
s06_e15_c02_u043	Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
s06_e15_c02_u044	Ohh, I would love too.
s06_e15_c02_u045	Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
s06_e15_c02_u046	Ohh! Okay!
s06_e15_c02_u047	Come on! (They start to leave.)
s06_e15_c02_u048	Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine) Busty Ladies?
s06_e15_c02_u049	No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't
s06_e15_c02_u050	(laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.
s06_e15_c02_u051	(putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.
s06_e15_c02_u052	But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
s06_e15_c02_u053	Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, let's go see Monica!
s06_e15_c03_u054	So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
s06_e15_c03_u055	He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
s06_e15_c03_u056	(returning) Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. (Hands it to Monica and sits down.)
s06_e15_c03_u057	Thanks.
s06_e15_c03_u058	Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
s06_e15_c03_u059	(not impressed) Wow!!
s06_e15_c03_u060	Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
s06_e15_c03_u061	Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)
s06_e15_c03_u062	(entering, depressed) Hey.
s06_e15_c03_u063	Hey.
s06_e15_c03_u064	Oh no! What's the matter?
s06_e15_c03_u065	Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
s06_e15_c03_u066	Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
s06_e15_c03_u067	Okay.
s06_e15_c03_u068	(kisses her) Okay.
s06_e15_c03_u069	Bye.
s06_e15_c03_u070	Bye-bye. (Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)
s06_e15_c03_u071	Was his question what's more boring than him?
s06_e15_c03_u072	Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
s06_e15_c03_u073	Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
s06_e15_c03_u074	Really?
s06_e15_c03_u075	Ehh.
s06_e15_c03_u076	Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
s06_e15_c03_u077	That's an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
s06_e15_c03_u078	No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
s06_e15_c03_u079	That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
s06_e15_c03_u080	I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
s06_e15_c03_u081	Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
s06_e15_c03_u082	Okay!
s06_e15_c03_u083	All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
s06_e15_c03_u084	All right!
s06_e15_c03_u085	(entering) Hey!
s06_e15_c03_u086	Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
s06_e15_c03_u087	What?
s06_e15_c03_u088	Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
s06_e15_c03_u089	Ohh that's so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
s06_e15_c03_u090	Hey Mon!
s06_e15_c03_u091	Hey!
s06_e15_c03_u092	Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)
s06_e15_c03_u093	(gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug, which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!
s06_e15_c03_u094	Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight? (She's not quite sure of that one.)
s06_e15_c03_u095	You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
s06_e15_c03_u096	And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)
s06_e15_c03_u097	Hey.
s06_e15_c03_u098	Oh yeah.
s06_e15_c03_u099	And that's Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)
s06_e15_c03_u100	Hi!
s06_e15_c03_u101	Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
s06_e15_c03_u102	(answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
s06_e15_c03_u103	Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?
s06_e15_c03_u104	Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime! I'll play you one of my other
s06_e15_c03_u105	(interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
s06_e15_c03_u106	Rach, he's a friend of ours.
s06_e15_c03_u107	(stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
s06_e15_c03_u108	Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
s06_e15_c03_u109	(To Rachel) Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
s06_e15_c03_u110	He's coming over! He's coming over!
s06_e15_c03_u111	(getting up) Joey!
s06_e15_c03_u112	(holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know, here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)
s06_e15_c03_u113	Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
s06_e15_c03_u114	(giggles and can't look at him) Hi!
s06_e15_c03_u115	(shaking Rachel's hand) Hi!
s06_e15_c03_u116	(still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you
s06_e15_c03_u117	Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
s06_e15_c03_u118	Ah!
s06_e15_c03_u119	(turning and whispering to Monica) She's not crazy is she?
s06_e15_c03_u120	No.
s06_e15_c03_u121	(To Rachel) So uh, how you doin'?
s06_e15_c04_u122	Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! (Answering the phone.) Go!! Who's this? (Listens) Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? (Listens) What kind of name is Brendy? I- Whatever- Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
s06_e15_c04_u123	(entering) Hey there you are!
s06_e15_c04_u124	Uh-oh, it's my boss!
s06_e15_c04_u125	All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits.)
s06_e15_c04_u126	(reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
s06_e15_c04_u127	(laughs) You realize what you are don't you?
s06_e15_c04_u128	What?
s06_e15_c04_u129	You're his bitch.
s06_e15_c04_u130	(yelling from Monica's room) No-no!! No!!
s06_e15_c04_u131	(panicked) Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
s06_e15_c04_u132	No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
s06_e15_c04_u133	But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
s06_e15_c04_u134	What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
s06_e15_c04_u135	What?!
s06_e15_c04_u136	(louder) My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
s06_e15_c04_u137	Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
s06_e15_c04_u138	Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
s06_e15_c04_u139	Yes!!
s06_e15_c04_u140	Then yes that is what I'm having. (Takes another puff of the cigarette.)
s06_e15_c04_u141	Oh my God!
s06_e15_c05_u142	Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
s06_e15_c05_u143	Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
s06_e15_c05_u144	Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
s06_e15_c05_u145	I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
s06_e15_c05_u146	Let's take a walk. (They start to leave.) Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)
s06_e15_c05_u147	(To Ross) So what's going on with you?
s06_e15_c05_u148	Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
s06_e15_c05_u149	Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
s06_e15_c05_u150	Yeah.
s06_e15_c05_u151	How long has it been since you had sex?
s06_e15_c05_u152	Well, last weekend
s06_e15_c05_u153	Oh that's not so bad.
s06_e15_c05_u154	will be two months
s06_e15_c05_u155	That is.
s06_e15_c05_u156	since I stopped trying.
s06_e15_c05_u157	Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
s06_e15_c05_u158	What-what do you mean?
s06_e15_c05_u159	I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other
s06_e15_c05_u160	Oh.
s06_e15_c05_u161	Y'know, dirty talk, menage a trois, toys
s06_e15_c05_u162	Wow!
s06_e15_c05_u163	Roll playing- You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
s06_e15_c05_u164	Okay, I think I got it.
s06_e15_c05_u165	Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.
s06_e15_c06_u166	Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
s06_e15_c06_u167	Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
s06_e15_c06_u168	(entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
s06_e15_c06_u169	Yeah! She's right in there! (Points to Phoebe's room.)
s06_e15_c06_u170	Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
s06_e15_c07_u171	All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
s06_e15_c07_u172	Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
s06_e15_c07_u173	Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. (Points at a large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
s06_e15_c07_u174	Hey!
s06_e15_c07_u175	All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
s06_e15_c07_u176	(laughs) Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
s06_e15_c07_u177	Why? (In Drake's voice.) Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
s06_e15_c07_u178	(awestruck, then not) Isn't that a line from the show?!
s06_e15_c07_u179	Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drake's voice) I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
s06_e15_c07_u180	That's a line from the show too!
s06_e15_c07_u181	Okay, you watch too much TV.
s06_e15_c07_u182	(approaching) Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)
s06_e15_c07_u183	Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, there's pulp in that. (Hands it back.)
s06_e15_c07_u184	Yeah?
s06_e15_c07_u185	I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
s06_e15_c07_u186	I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
s06_e15_c07_u187	Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.) Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
s06_e15_c07_u188	Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
s06_e15_c07_u189	(To Chandler) Iced tea.
s06_e15_c07_u190	Okay, anything for you sir?
s06_e15_c07_u191	(To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?
s06_e15_c07_u192	(mouthing it to him) Yes, you did.
s06_e15_c07_u193	(To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares at him.) You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
s06_e15_c07_u194	It's not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
s06_e15_c08_u195	So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
s06_e15_c08_u196	Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
s06_e15_c08_u197	Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
s06_e15_c08_u198	What do you mean?
s06_e15_c08_u199	Carol our sex life is-it's just not working
s06_e15_c08_u200	(entering) Dad!! (Runs and hugs him.)
s06_e15_c08_u201	Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!
s06_e15_c08_u202	Yay! (Runs off.)
s06_e15_c08_u203	Yay! (To Carol) Seriously, our sex life- I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
s06_e15_c08_u204	Like what?
s06_e15_c08_u205	Well I don't know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (Carol's shocked and obviously doesn't like that idea.) Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. (Carol doesn't like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
s06_e15_c08_u206	(quickly) I love that idea!
s06_e15_c09_u207	Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
s06_e15_c09_u208	Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! (Hugs him.) You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
s06_e15_c09_u209	Aww.
s06_e15_c09_u210	Wait a minute! (Quickly checks her pockets and pulls out-) My last Kit-Kat bar!
s06_e15_c09_u211	You wanna share it?
s06_e15_c09_u212	Okay!!
s06_e15_c09_u213	(entering) Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
s06_e15_c09_u214	It's not mayonnaise!!
s06_e15_c09_u215	Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here. (Hands him a cup.)
s06_e15_c09_u216	What's this?
s06_e15_c09_u217	Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
s06_e15_c09_u218	Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)
s06_e15_c09_u219	Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
s06_e15_c09_u220	Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
s06_e15_c09_u221	Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
s06_e15_c09_u222	Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
s06_e15_c09_u223	Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
s06_e15_c09_u224	Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? Cause I think I read it!
s06_e15_c10_u225	Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
s06_e15_c10_u226	Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
s06_e15_c10_u227	Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
s06_e15_c10_u228	Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
s06_e15_c10_u229	Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
s06_e15_c10_u230	Well, you're not.
s06_e15_c10_u231	Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
s06_e15_c10_u232	Yeah I can! (Laughs) And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha! (Laughs.)
s06_e15_c10_u233	Monica. You've, you've done it right?
s06_e15_c10_u234	(giggles) Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
s06_e15_c10_u235	Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
s06_e15_c10_u236	Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
s06_e15_c10_u237	It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
s06_e15_c10_u238	Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
s06_e15_c10_u239	Y'know what? You are right?!
s06_e15_c10_u240	Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever
s06_e15_c10_u241	Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
s06_e15_c10_u242	Oh what do you know? Virgin!
s06_e15_c11_u243	Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
s06_e15_c11_u244	Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
s06_e15_c11_u245	Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
s06_e15_c11_u246	No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
s06_e15_c11_u247	Put it out!!
s06_e15_c11_u248	Okay! Okay! (Puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) I'm so glad you're here.
s06_e15_c11_u249	Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.
s06_e15_c11_u250	Oh, give it to me.
s06_e15_c11_u251	I got it!
s06_e15_c11_u252	Give it!
s06_e15_c11_u253	(on the phone) Hello? (Listens.) No she can't come to the phone right now. (Listens.) Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye. (Hangs up.)
s06_e15_c11_u254	Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
s06_e15_c11_u255	J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
s06_e15_c11_u256	Thank God.
s06_e15_c11_u257	(To Monica) Yeah, she's fired.
s06_e15_c12_u258	Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
s06_e15_c12_u259	Not so fast Wesley! (Rachel does a silent clap.)
s06_e15_c12_u260	(with evil dripping off his tongue) Remoray!
s06_e15_c12_u261	That's right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you're not a real doctor! And that woman's brain, is fine!
s06_e15_c12_u262	(very relived) Oh! Thank God!
s06_e15_c12_u263	Hope! Hope!
s06_e15_c12_u264	(sleepily) Drake!
s06_e15_c12_u265	You're not dying Hope, you're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
s06_e15_c12_u266	Oh Drake.
s06_e15_c12_u267	Okay! (She picks up the phone, Joey's phone number, and starts to dial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.) Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
s06_e15_c13_u268	So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find
s06_e15_c13_u269	Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
s06_e15_c13_u270	Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someone's been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)
s06_e15_c13_u271	Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so
s06_e15_c13_u272	Oh, I know. (Laughs) Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda
s06_e15_c13_u273	Oh, me too.
s06_e15_c13_u274	Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
s06_e15_c13_u275	Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
s06_e15_c13_u276	Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
s06_e15_c14_u277	Hey, Pheebs!
s06_e15_c14_u278	Hey.
s06_e15_c14_u279	Hey, how's it going?
s06_e15_c14_u280	Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
s06_e15_c14_u281	(handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.
s06_e15_c14_u282	What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
s06_e15_c14_u283	But, I put some honey in it.
s06_e15_c14_u284	She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
s06_e15_c14_u285	No, the doctors say it may kill her.
s06_e15_c14_u286	What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
s06_e15_c14_u287	(To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
s06_e15_c14_u288	Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
s06_e15_c14_u289	Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! (Points at Ross.)
s06_e15_c14_u290	Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
s06_e15_c14_u291	I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
s06_e15_c14_u292	Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
s06_e15_c14_u293	Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
s06_e15_c14_u294	Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
s06_e15_c14_u295	Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
s06_e15_c15_u296	Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
s06_e15_c15_u297	I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on polls. You'll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.
s06_e15_c15_u298	Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)
s06_e15_c15_u299	(climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
s06_e15_c15_u300	Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! (Joey starts making her refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
s06_e15_c15_u301	Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
s06_e15_c15_u302	Umm, can I use your bathroom?
s06_e15_c15_u303	It's uh, right through there. (Points.)
s06_e15_c15_u304	Okay. (Starts to go.) God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment
s06_e15_c15_u305	Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
s06_e15_c15_u306	Yeah, it sure is!
s06_e15_c16_u307	I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
s06_e15_c16_u308	They have parasites?
s06_e15_c16_u309	No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
s06_e15_c16_u310	What people?
s06_e15_c16_u311	People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)
s06_e15_c16_u312	So oysters, huh?
s06_e15_c16_u313	And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
s06_e15_c16_u314	Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases
s06_e15_c16_u315	No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
s06_e15_c16_u316	Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
s06_e15_c16_u317	Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!
s06_e15_c16_u318	I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
s06_e15_c16_u319	I can't promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)
s06_e15_c17_u320	We're really gonna do this, huh?
s06_e15_c17_u321	Looks like it.
s06_e15_c17_u322	Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at- (A knock on the door interrupts him.)
s06_e15_c17_u323	(jumping up to get it) I got it!
s06_e15_c17_u324	Okay.
s06_e15_c17_u325	(opening the door) Susan! Hi! (Who'd you think it was gonna be?)
s06_e15_c17_u326	Hey! (They hug.)
s06_e15_c17_u327	Thank you so much for coming.
s06_e15_c17_u328	Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
s06_e15_c17_u329	I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
s06_e15_c17_u330	(not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and hands it to him.) I love what you've done with this space.
s06_e15_c17_u331	Thank you so much.
s06_e15_c17_u332	How hot is this?!
s06_e15_c18_u333	I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
s06_e15_c18_u334	Yeah, me too.
s06_e15_c18_u335	Well, I could make it seem like he's here. (Imitates him.) "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)
s06_e15_c18_u336	Stop it!! That's not funny!!
s06_e15_c18_u337	Okay.
s06_e15_c18_u338	I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
s06_e15_c18_u339	What was tonight?
s06_e15_c18_u340	You don't want to know what tonight was.
s06_e15_c18_u341	Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
s06_e15_c18_u342	Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
s06_e15_c18_u343	With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!
s06_e15_c18_u344	All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
s06_e15_c18_u345	Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
s06_e15_c18_u346	How many?
s06_e15_c18_u347	Nine.
s06_e15_c18_u348	I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
s06_e15_c18_u349	Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
s06_e15_c18_u350	No. He's not a horrible guy.
s06_e15_c18_u351	Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
s06_e15_c18_u352	Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
s06_e15_c18_u353	No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
s06_e15_c18_u354	Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
s06_e15_c18_u355	Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
s06_e15_c18_u356	I was kidding.
s06_e15_c18_u357	So was I.
s06_e15_c19_u358	Joey, you're such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
s06_e15_c19_u359	Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
s06_e15_c19_u360	Wow! Tell me something Joey-(She falls off the couch)-Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
s06_e15_c19_u361	Yeah you did.
s06_e15_c19_u362	Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.)
s06_e15_c19_u363	Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
s06_e15_c19_u364	Yeah?
s06_e15_c19_u365	When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
s06_e15_c19_u366	Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
s06_e15_c19_u367	Come, come here.
s06_e15_c20_u368	We can't do this.
s06_e15_c20_u369	No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?
s06_e15_c20_u370	Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
s06_e15_c20_u371	Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
s06_e15_c20_u372	I do like that.
s06_e15_c20_u373	It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
s06_e15_c20_u374	Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
s06_e15_c20_u375	Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out another friend. (Points at herself.)
s06_e15_c20_u376	Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
s06_e15_c20_u377	Noo!! Okay!!
s06_e15_c20_u378	Okay! (They both get up.)
s06_e15_c20_u379	Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
s06_e15_c20_u380	I have some moves.
s06_e15_c20_u381	I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs away.) Okay, whatcha doin' there?! (Giggles.) Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
s06_e15_c20_u382	Yeah, let's just forget it.
s06_e15_c20_u383	What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)
s06_e15_c20_u384	Okay!
s06_e15_c20_u385	Oh yeah.
s06_e15_c20_u386	Chandler?
s06_e15_c20_u387	(sexily) Yeah?
s06_e15_c20_u388	That's the couch.
s06_e15_c21_u389	Oh my God!
s06_e15_c21_u390	I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
s06_e15_c21_u391	Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)
s06_e15_c22_u392	(entering) Morning!
s06_e15_c22_u393	(wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.
s06_e15_c22_u394	Yeah.
s06_e15_c22_u395	(groans) Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
s06_e15_c22_u396	Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
s06_e15_c22_u397	Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh
s06_e15_c22_u398	No! No! No, not after seeing that.
s06_e15_c22_u399	God I'm just a horrible person.
s06_e15_c22_u400	Wh-why?
s06_e15_c22_u401	Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
s06_e15_c22_u402	That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
s06_e15_c22_u403	Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
s06_e15_c22_u404	Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me
s06_e15_c22_u405	The ring from the cave, yeah.
s06_e15_c22_u406	Wow! Uh okay, well uh- (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)
s06_e15_c22_u407	(seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
s06_e15_c22_u408	Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
s06_e15_c22_u409	Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
s06_e15_c22_u410	But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
s06_e15_c22_u411	Look, do you want the ring or not?!
s06_e15_c22_u412	Yeah!
s06_e15_c23_u413	Hey!
s06_e15_c23_u414	Hey!
s06_e15_c23_u415	Look at you! You're up!
s06_e15_c23_u416	All right!
s06_e15_c23_u417	I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
s06_e15_c23_u418	Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
s06_e15_c23_u419	No. I've learned my lesson.
s06_e15_c23_u420	Let's go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old man who's holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.) Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)
s06_e15_c23_u421	Hey Joe did- Did you ever have a threesome?
s06_e15_c23_u422	(not quite sure of how to answer that) Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I-.
s06_e15_c23_u423	No! The reason I'm asking is that- I sorta had one last night.
s06_e15_c23_u424	You?
s06_e15_c23_u425	Yeah!
s06_e15_c23_u426	Wow!
s06_e15_c23_u427	Yeah!
s06_e15_c23_u428	All right! So, was it amazing?
s06_e15_c23_u429	It was, it was okay.
s06_e15_c23_u430	Just okay-Did you do it right?!
s06_e15_c23_u431	Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
s06_e15_c23_u432	Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
s06_e15_c23_u433	Oh-oh, absolutely!
s06_e15_c23_u434	It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
s06_e15_c23_u435	But you got to be with both of them, right?
s06_e15_c23_u436	Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
s06_e15_c23_u437	Not the other one?
s06_e15_c23_u438	No, she kept kicking me away!
s06_e15_c23_u439	Yeah, you don't want that.
s06_e15_c23_u440	No!
s06_e15_c23_u441	Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
s06_e15_c23_u442	Oh I a lot of stuff!
s06_e15_c23_u443	You got a little bored?
s06_e15_c23_u444	A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
s06_e15_c23_u445	Yeah? What did ya have?
s06_e15_c23_u446	Ross: Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard
s06_e15_c23_u447	Sounds good.
s06_e15_c23_u448	It really was!
s06_e15_c24_u449	Hey!
s06_e15_c24_u450	Hey!
s06_e15_c24_u451	Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
s06_e15_c24_u452	Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
s06_e15_c24_u453	So you uh, want to do something tonight?
s06_e15_c24_u454	Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
s06_e15_c24_u455	Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when- (He fakes falling asleep.)
s06_e15_c24_u456	Are you okay?
s06_e15_c24_u457	Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
s06_e15_c24_u458	Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
s06_e15_c24_u459	I bet he can.
s06_e15_c24_u460	Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. (He laughs halfheartedly) Are you sure you're okay?
s06_e15_c24_u461	Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine! (Does a kara-tay move.)
s06_e15_c25_u462	Ohh! My God! Barry!!
s06_e15_c25_u463	You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
s06_e15_c25_u464	Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
s06_e15_c26_u465	Surprise! Look who's back!
s06_e15_c26_u466	Hey Pheebs!
s06_e15_c26_u467	Hey!
s06_e15_c26_u468	(To another coworker) Call security. (To Phoebe) Pheebs, didn't you get fired?
s06_e15_c26_u469	Uh, I don't think so!
s06_e15_c26_u470	Phoebe?
s06_e15_c26_u471	Jack!! Hey!
s06_e15_c26_u472	What are you doing here?
s06_e15_c26_u473	All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?
s06_e15_c26_u474	Well, you were fired.
s06_e15_c26_u475	Nu-uh!
s06_e15_c26_u476	I told that guy who answered your phone.
s06_e15_c26_u477	Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office.
s06_e15_c26_u478	Uh, Phoebe you-you don't have an office.
s06_e15_c26_u479	That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant. (She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)
s06_e15_c26_u480	(approaches her) Phoebe, listen
s06_e15_c26_u481	You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake
s06_e15_c26_u482	You lost 13 million dollars.
s06_e15_c26_u483	Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!
s06_e15_c26_u484	Are you all right?
s06_e15_c26_u485	I'm having another heart attack!
s06_e15_c26_u486	What?!
s06_e15_c26_u487	I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
s06_e15_c26_u488	Take it easy. (Sits her down.)
s06_e15_c26_u489	(to Arthur, he's the guy calling 9-1-1) Dumbass!
s06_e15_c26_u490	Hey Pheebs! How's it going?!
s06_e15_c26_u491	Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack.
s06_e15_c26_u492	Wow! Well, welcome back!
s06_e15_c26_u493	Yeah.
s06_e15_c27_u494	Hi Ross!
s06_e15_c27_u495	Hey Rachel.
s06_e15_c27_u496	Is Joey Tribbiani here?
s06_e15_c27_u497	Umm, no.
s06_e15_c27_u498	Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
s06_e15_c27_u499	That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
s06_e15_c27_u500	Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
s06_e15_c27_u501	Yeah.
s06_e15_c27_u502	Sit down!
s06_e15_c27_u503	Okay. (He does so.)
s06_e15_c27_u504	Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
s06_e15_c27_u505	We're sorry.
s06_e15_c27_u506	No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
s06_e15_c27_u507	Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
s06_e15_c27_u508	Aw what are you?! A detective?
s06_e15_c27_u509	Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
s06_e15_c27_u510	Oh. (Doesn't believe it.)
s06_e15_c27_u511	Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
s06_e15_c27_u512	Who are these men?
s06_e15_c27_u513	Men. I guy I know.
s06_e15_c27_u514	Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.
s06_e15_c27_u515	She is not- (Realizes) She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
s06_e15_c27_u516	Good day for married people huh?
s06_e15_c27_u517	I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
s06_e15_c27_u518	I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
s06_e15_c27_u519	Try telling my wife that.
s06_e15_c28_u520	(sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?
s06_e15_c28_u521	Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
s06_e15_c28_u522	Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
s06_e15_c28_u523	What?!
s06_e15_c28_u524	I'm the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)
s06_e15_c28_u525	Why would you do that?
s06_e15_c28_u526	Because you shouldn't be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.
s06_e15_c28_u527	Really?
s06_e15_c28_u528	Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
s06_e15_c28_u529	Chandler!
s06_e15_c28_u530	I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor-"
s06_e15_c28_u531	There was just one woman, wasn't there?
s06_e15_c28_u532	No, there were two.
s06_e15_c28_u533	Including me?
s06_e15_c28_u534	Oh yeah.
s06_e15_c29_u535	(singing)
s07_e03_c01_u001	Hey, you guys!
s07_e03_c01_u002	So, what do you think?
s07_e03_c01_u003	About what?
s07_e03_c01_u004	Yeah, what?
s07_e03_c01_u005	What?
s07_e03_c01_u006	Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)
s07_e03_c01_u007	Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!
s07_e03_c01_u008	I got glasses!
s07_e03_c01_u009	Well, you-you've always had glasses.
s07_e03_c01_u010	No I didn't!
s07_e03_c01_u011	Are you sure?
s07_e03_c01_u012	Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm
s07_e03_c01_u013	Feminine.
s07_e03_c01_u014	Yes!
s07_e03_c01_u015	No!
s07_e03_c01_u016	Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
s07_e03_c01_u017	Really?
s07_e03_c01_u018	Yeah!
s07_e03_c01_u019	(sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
s07_e03_c01_u020	Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of the gang.)
s07_e03_c02_u021	So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
s07_e03_c02_u022	That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us
s07_e03_c02_u023	(interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
s07_e03_c02_u024	Oh, y'know what you should get em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
s07_e03_c02_u025	Oh, I already have one.
s07_e03_c02_u026	Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
s07_e03_c02_u027	Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
s07_e03_c02_u028	Hey, I know I what I want!
s07_e03_c02_u029	What we want honey.
s07_e03_c02_u030	No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
s07_e03_c02_u031	You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
s07_e03_c02_u032	Uh-huh, yeah.
s07_e03_c02_u033	You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
s07_e03_c02_u034	Dying people say the craziest things.
s07_e03_c02_u035	I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
s07_e03_c02_u036	Break my heart-Oh, all right.
s07_e03_c02_u037	Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
s07_e03_c02_u038	Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
s07_e03_c02_u039	(entering) Ahoy!
s07_e03_c02_u040	Hey! How's the boat?!
s07_e03_c02_u041	Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
s07_e03_c02_u042	Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
s07_e03_c02_u043	Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
s07_e03_c02_u044	If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?
s07_e03_c02_u045	Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)
s07_e03_c02_u046	Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.
s07_e03_c02_u047	Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
s07_e03_c02_u048	You could?
s07_e03_c02_u049	Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
s07_e03_c02_u050	Your own boat?
s07_e03_c02_u051	What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
s07_e03_c03_u052	Do you know what I was thinkin'?
s07_e03_c03_u053	What?
s07_e03_c03_u054	Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)
s07_e03_c03_u055	(entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
s07_e03_c03_u056	Uh why, do you have a lecture?
s07_e03_c03_u057	No, why?
s07_e03_c03_u058	Then free as a bird. What's up?
s07_e03_c03_u059	My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
s07_e03_c03_u060	Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play.
s07_e03_c03_u061	Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
s07_e03_c03_u062	Well, did-did you correct him?
s07_e03_c03_u063	No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
s07_e03_c03_u064	This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
s07_e03_c03_u065	Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
s07_e03_c03_u066	Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
s07_e03_c03_u067	Yeah.
s07_e03_c03_u068	He hates to lose.
s07_e03_c03_u069	Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand.
s07_e03_c03_u070	You're not a lefty?
s07_e03_c03_u071	Does anybody know me?!
s07_e03_c03_u072	What's wrong Phoebe?
s07_e03_c03_u073	I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
s07_e03_c03_u074	No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
s07_e03_c03_u075	(pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
s07_e03_c03_u076	Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
s07_e03_c03_u077	Don't worry about it Pheebs.
s07_e03_c03_u078	No one got me an engagement present.
s07_e03_c03_u079	Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)
s07_e03_c03_u080	An old cookie?
s07_e03_c03_u081	(To Chandler) This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
s07_e03_c03_u082	See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
s07_e03_c03_u083	We can't accept this.
s07_e03_c03_u084	Why not?
s07_e03_c03_u085	Cause it's gross.
s07_e03_c03_u086	No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
s07_e03_c03_u087	Really?!
s07_e03_c03_u088	Yeah! I bet I can do it.
s07_e03_c03_u089	Okay, we owe you a present.
s07_e03_c03_u090	Two! I've been engaged twice!
s07_e03_c04_u091	(drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
s07_e03_c04_u092	That is the Coast Guard.
s07_e03_c04_u093	What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there. (Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)
s07_e03_c04_u094	Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.
s07_e03_c04_u095	All right.
s07_e03_c04_u096	Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
s07_e03_c04_u097	Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them) Yo-ho-ho!
s07_e03_c04_u098	Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) what's this called?
s07_e03_c04_u099	Uh, boat rope.
s07_e03_c04_u100	Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
s07_e03_c04_u101	Uhh, rub it?
s07_e03_c04_u102	No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
s07_e03_c04_u103	I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh
s07_e03_c04_u104	Time's up, now your dead.
s07_e03_c04_u105	And deaf!
s07_e03_c04_u106	Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
s07_e03_c04_u107	Yes.
s07_e03_c04_u108	Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
s07_e03_c04_u109	I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
s07_e03_c05_u110	All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
s07_e03_c05_u111	You do?
s07_e03_c05_u112	You don't? (Laughs) Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman.
s07_e03_c05_u113	That and arrogance.
s07_e03_c05_u114	(entering) Hey.
s07_e03_c05_u115	Hey! How was sailing?
s07_e03_c05_u116	I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what's left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)
s07_e03_c05_u117	(recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)
s07_e03_c05_u118	I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.
s07_e03_c05_u119	(entering with Chandler) Hey.
s07_e03_c05_u120	Hey! How was it?
s07_e03_c05_u121	Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand
s07_e03_c05_u122	I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
s07_e03_c05_u123	And what did he ask you not to call him?
s07_e03_c05_u124	Daddy. All right look, here's the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
s07_e03_c05_u125	Guys?
s07_e03_c05_u126	Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)
s07_e03_c05_u127	Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door as Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits next to him with a shocked expression on his face.)
s07_e03_c06_u128	Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
s07_e03_c06_u129	I know.
s07_e03_c06_u130	You gave my father a lap dance!
s07_e03_c06_u131	Why do they put so much steam in there?!
s07_e03_c06_u132	Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
s07_e03_c06_u133	Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
s07_e03_c06_u134	Come on, it's not that big a deal!
s07_e03_c06_u135	Not that big a deal? There-there was touching of things.
s07_e03_c06_u136	Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
s07_e03_c06_u137	Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
s07_e03_c06_u138	I don't want him to tell this story for years.
s07_e03_c06_u139	Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
s07_e03_c06_u140	I wasn't escaping.
s07_e03_c06_u141	Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
s07_e03_c06_u142	I was trying to help out a squirrel.
s07_e03_c06_u143	You were trying to eat it!
s07_e03_c06_u144	If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
s07_e03_c06_u145	(takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) I'm sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)
s07_e03_c07_u146	(getting up) All right, I'm off to see your dad.
s07_e03_c07_u147	Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
s07_e03_c07_u148	(laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
s07_e03_c07_u149	Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass. (Exits.)
s07_e03_c07_u150	(To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
s07_e03_c07_u151	I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything.
s07_e03_c07_u152	Thank you!
s07_e03_c07_u153	(entering) Hey.
s07_e03_c07_u154	Hey.
s07_e03_c07_u155	Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?
s07_e03_c07_u156	Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
s07_e03_c07_u157	Why not?
s07_e03_c07_u158	Because! You're mean on the boat!
s07_e03_c07_u159	What? I was just trying to teach you.
s07_e03_c07_u160	Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
s07_e03_c07_u161	Yeeeeeep- Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
s07_e03_c07_u162	Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
s07_e03_c07_u163	You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)
s07_e03_c07_u164	Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
s07_e03_c07_u165	Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"
s07_e03_c07_u166	Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
s07_e03_c07_u167	Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
s07_e03_c07_u168	Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!
s07_e03_c07_u169	Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
s07_e03_c07_u170	All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
s07_e03_c07_u171	You won't boss me around anymore?
s07_e03_c07_u172	I won't boss you around.
s07_e03_c07_u173	And you'll be nice?
s07_e03_c07_u174	And, I'll be nice.
s07_e03_c07_u175	And you'll be topless?
s07_e03_c07_u176	And-Joey!
s07_e03_c07_u177	Do you want me to learn?!
s07_e03_c08_u178	Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
s07_e03_c08_u179	Let's give it a shot.
s07_e03_c08_u180	Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
s07_e03_c08_u181	Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
s07_e03_c08_u182	No, just a Friday night.
s07_e03_c08_u183	Ohh, these are pretty good.
s07_e03_c08_u184	Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
s07_e03_c08_u185	Which one was that?
s07_e03_c08_u186	The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
s07_e03_c08_u187	Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a little bit.) I'm okay.
s07_e03_c08_u188	Are there anymore from the good batch? Cause we could just work off of those.
s07_e03_c08_u189	Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh- (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn't like it.) It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
s07_e03_c09_u190	Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
s07_e03_c09_u191	Ohh yeah.
s07_e03_c09_u192	Right?
s07_e03_c09_u193	Nope.
s07_e03_c09_u194	It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.
s07_e03_c09_u195	I don't know why you just don't say left.
s07_e03_c09_u196	Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!
s07_e03_c09_u197	Huh?
s07_e03_c09_u198	(yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)
s07_e03_c09_u199	(hurrying over) Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?
s07_e03_c09_u200	No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
s07_e03_c09_u201	Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)
s07_e03_c09_u202	Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
s07_e03_c09_u203	Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
s07_e03_c09_u204	Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)
s07_e03_c09_u205	Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
s07_e03_c09_u206	(angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
s07_e03_c09_u207	All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
s07_e03_c09_u208	What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
s07_e03_c09_u209	Why not?!
s07_e03_c09_u210	Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
s07_e03_c09_u211	Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
s07_e03_c09_u212	Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don't quit?!
s07_e03_c09_u213	Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
s07_e03_c09_u214	No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
s07_e03_c09_u215	Well, hey I did learn.
s07_e03_c09_u216	Really?
s07_e03_c09_u217	Yeah! Come on.
s07_e03_c09_u218	Awww
s07_e03_c09_u219	Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. It's the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
s07_e03_c09_u220	Left.
s07_e03_c09_u221	Damnit!
s07_e03_c10_u222	Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
s07_e03_c10_u223	Looking up?
s07_e03_c10_u224	Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.
s07_e03_c10_u225	Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right.
s07_e03_c10_u226	Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
s07_e03_c10_u227	Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening til October 15th, 2032.
s07_e03_c10_u228	That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.
s07_e03_c10_u229	That's what you think.
s07_e03_c10_u230	Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?
s07_e03_c10_u231	Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
s07_e03_c10_u232	What was her name?
s07_e03_c10_u233	Nesele Toulouse.
s07_e03_c10_u234	Nestle Tollhouse?!
s07_e03_c10_u235	Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
s07_e03_c10_u236	(grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)
s07_e03_c10_u237	(reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.
s07_e03_c10_u238	I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
s07_e03_c10_u239	I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) you're burning in hell!!
s07_e03_c11_u240	So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little-I'm a little embarrassed about it.
s07_e03_c11_u241	I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
s07_e03_c11_u242	What did you do when they found out?
s07_e03_c11_u243	They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
s07_e03_c11_u244	So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
s07_e03_c12_u245	Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
s07_e03_c12_u246	Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)
s07_e03_c12_u247	Ohh we're not sailing.
s07_e03_c12_u248	Just pull on it.
s07_e03_c12_u249	All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what's in the cooler.) Sandwiches!
s07_e03_c12_u250	What else?
s07_e03_c12_u251	(hands him one) Here you go.
s07_e03_c12_u252	Thank you.
s07_e03_c12_u253	Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)
s07_e03_c12_u254	What are you doing?
s07_e03_c12_u255	Ohh, sorry.
s07_e03_c12_u256	What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
s07_e03_c12_u257	Ohh whoops.
s07_e03_c12_u258	Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! I'm my dad!
s01_e17_c06_u001	Hey.
s01_e17_c06_u002	Ah here, we brought wine.
s01_e17_c06_u003	Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
s01_e17_c06_u004	So, Monica, how's the ankle?
s01_e17_c06_u005	So?
s01_e17_c06_u006	So... they sss-still seem normal.
s01_e17_c06_u007	That's because they are.
s01_e17_c06_u008	(Nervously) okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
s01_e17_c06_u009	Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. (Baring his teeth to clean them with his finger) Go like this. (Dr. Rosen obeys.)
s01_e17_c06_u010	This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
s01_e17_c06_u011	(as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
s01_e17_c06_u012	(as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
s01_e17_c06_u013	Really?
s01_e17_c06_u014	(as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?
s01_e17_c06_u015	So, Monica, what do you do?
s01_e17_c06_u016	(as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
s01_e17_c06_u017	Good for you.
s01_e17_c06_u018	(as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
s01_e17_c06_u019	This hummus is great.
s01_e17_c06_u020	God bless the chickpea.
s01_e17_c06_u021	(as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
s01_e17_c06_u022	(as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
s01_e17_c06_u023	(as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
s01_e17_c06_u024	(as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
s01_e17_c06_u025	(as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that!
s01_e17_c06_u026	(on the phone) Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second... (handing it to Monica) ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
s01_e17_c06_u027	(as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
s01_e17_c06_u028	(as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
s01_e17_c07_u029	(taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank you. (Hangs up)
s01_e17_c09_u030	(as Monica) Hi, remember us?
s01_e17_c09_u031	(as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause um...
s01_e17_c09_u032	(as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
s01_e17_c09_u033	(as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
s01_e17_c09_u034	(as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
s01_e17_c11_u035	(as Rachel) Monica.
s01_e17_c11_u036	(as Monica) Oh.
s01_e17_c11_u037	(as Rachel) Hi.
s01_e17_c11_u038	(as Monica) Hi.
s01_e17_c12_u039	(as Ursula) Hey.
s01_e17_c12_u040	(as Ursula) Listen, um...
s01_e17_c12_u041	(as Ursula) I'm sorry.
s01_e17_c12_u042	(as Ursula): Yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
s01_e17_c12_u043	(as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
s01_e17_c12_u044	(as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
s01_e17_c12_u045	(as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
s01_e17_c12_u046	(as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
s01_e17_c12_u047	(as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee) You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
s10_e17_c01_u001	Previously on Friends.
s10_e17_c01_u002	Erica, are you okay?
s10_e17_c01_u003	Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
s10_e17_c01_u004	Oh my God!
s10_e17_c01_u005	Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
s10_e17_c01_u006	She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
s10_e17_c01_u007	Oh my God!
s10_e17_c01_u008	So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
s10_e17_c01_u009	Rach!
s10_e17_c01_u010	What?!
s10_e17_c02_u011	Hey.
s10_e17_c02_u012	Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
s10_e17_c02_u013	Oh. This was amazing.
s10_e17_c02_u014	It really was. You've learned some new moves!
s10_e17_c02_u015	Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.
s10_e17_c02_u016	Ah.
s10_e17_c02_u017	Who's laughing now?
s10_e17_c02_u018	I know!
s10_e17_c03_u019	Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.
s10_e17_c03_u020	Next time, can I say breathe?
s10_e17_c03_u021	No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
s10_e17_c03_u022	No, I'm okay.
s10_e17_c03_u023	Alright, I'll be right back.
s10_e17_c03_u024	Where are you going?
s10_e17_c03_u025	To use the bathroom.
s10_e17_c03_u026	You can't leave me alone with her.
s10_e17_c03_u027	What?
s10_e17_c03_u028	This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
s10_e17_c03_u029	What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
s10_e17_c03_u030	It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
s10_e17_c03_u031	You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
s10_e17_c03_u032	Okay.
s10_e17_c03_u033	So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
s10_e17_c03_u034	I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
s10_e17_c03_u035	Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
s10_e17_c03_u036	What?
s10_e17_c03_u037	Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
s10_e17_c03_u038	One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
s10_e17_c04_u039	Morning.
s10_e17_c04_u040	Hey!
s10_e17_c04_u041	What's that?
s10_e17_c04_u042	It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
s10_e17_c04_u043	It's a baby chick and duck!
s10_e17_c04_u044	Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
s10_e17_c04_u045	I did not see that coming.
s10_e17_c04_u046	Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
s10_e17_c04_u047	Yes.
s10_e17_c04_u048	Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
s10_e17_c04_u049	That is the rule, though.
s10_e17_c04_u050	Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
s10_e17_c04_u051	What?
s10_e17_c04_u052	Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
s10_e17_c04_u053	Oh my God!
s10_e17_c04_u054	Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
s10_e17_c04_u055	Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
s10_e17_c04_u056	Have you seen him throw a ball?
s10_e17_c04_u057	Is Rachel here?
s10_e17_c04_u058	Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
s10_e17_c04_u059	Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
s10_e17_c04_u060	What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
s10_e17_c04_u061	Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
s10_e17_c04_u062	Oh my God. You and Rachel?
s10_e17_c04_u063	I know, it's pretty great.
s10_e17_c04_u064	So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
s10_e17_c04_u065	Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
s10_e17_c04_u066	But do you wanna get back together?
s10_e17_c04_u067	I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
s10_e17_c04_u068	(screaming) YAY!
s10_e17_c04_u069	Shhh!
s10_e17_c04_u070	(quietly) Yay!
s10_e17_c04_u071	So, so is she still going to Paris?
s10_e17_c04_u072	Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
s10_e17_c04_u073	Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! (Singing) "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."
s10_e17_c04_u074	Morning!
s10_e17_c04_u075	Guess we'll never know how it ends.
s10_e17_c04_u076	Okay.
s10_e17_c04_u077	Hey.
s10_e17_c04_u078	Hey.
s10_e17_c04_u079	Hey. How did you sleep?
s10_e17_c04_u080	Good. You?
s10_e17_c04_u081	Good.
s10_e17_c04_u082	I bet you did!
s10_e17_c04_u083	Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
s10_e17_c04_u084	Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
s10_e17_c04_u085	Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
s10_e17_c04_u086	(interrupting) Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
s10_e17_c04_u087	So...
s10_e17_c04_u088	Morning.
s10_e17_c04_u089	You too. Last night was just wonderful.
s10_e17_c04_u090	It really was.
s10_e17_c04_u091	I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
s10_e17_c04_u092	I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
s10_e17_c04_u093	Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She hugs him, and Ross looks crushed.)
s10_e17_c05_u094	It's just a little bit more, honey.
s10_e17_c05_u095	Help me! This hurts!
s10_e17_c05_u096	Is it really that bad?
s10_e17_c05_u097	Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!
s10_e17_c05_u098	The baby's head is crowning.
s10_e17_c05_u099	Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!
s10_e17_c05_u100	I'm okay.
s10_e17_c05_u101	Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
s10_e17_c05_u102	Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
s10_e17_c05_u103	Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
s10_e17_c05_u104	It's a... It's a boy!
s10_e17_c05_u105	Wow!
s10_e17_c05_u106	Is he okay?
s10_e17_c05_u107	He's just fine.
s10_e17_c05_u108	Oh, you did it!
s10_e17_c05_u109	(emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
s10_e17_c05_u110	Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
s10_e17_c05_u111	Well, that's spongy.
s10_e17_c05_u112	(to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!
s10_e17_c05_u113	I know. He has your eyes.
s10_e17_c05_u114	I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
s10_e17_c05_u115	We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
s10_e17_c05_u116	Okay.
s10_e17_c05_u117	(To Erica) Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
s10_e17_c05_u118	I'm really happy for you guys.
s10_e17_c05_u119	How do you feel?
s10_e17_c05_u120	I'm tired!
s10_e17_c05_u121	Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
s10_e17_c05_u122	I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
s10_e17_c05_u123	The next baby should be along in a minute.
s10_e17_c05_u124	We only ordered one!
s10_e17_c05_u125	You know it's twins, right?
s10_e17_c05_u126	Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
s10_e17_c06_u127	I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.
s10_e17_c06_u128	Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
s10_e17_c06_u129	(to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?
s10_e17_c06_u130	Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
s10_e17_c06_u131	(to Erica) Anybody tell you?
s10_e17_c06_u132	I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
s10_e17_c06_u133	This is unbelievable.
s10_e17_c06_u134	Twins actually run in my family.
s10_e17_c06_u135	Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?
s10_e17_c06_u136	What do we do?
s10_e17_c06_u137	What do you mean "what do we do"?
s10_e17_c06_u138	(panicking) Twins! Twins!!
s10_e17_c06_u139	Chandler, you're panicking!
s10_e17_c06_u140	Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
s10_e17_c06_u141	We can't split them up!
s10_e17_c06_u142	Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
s10_e17_c06_u143	Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
s10_e17_c06_u144	What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
s10_e17_c06_u145	Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
s10_e17_c06_u146	Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
s10_e17_c06_u147	That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
s10_e17_c06_u148	(smiles) Okay. Shhh...
s10_e17_c06_u149	Okay.
s10_e17_c06_u150	Okay!
s10_e17_c06_u151	Okay!
s10_e17_c06_u152	It looks like we're about ready over here.
s10_e17_c06_u153	Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
s10_e17_c06_u154	Ow!
s10_e17_c06_u155	Here she comes!
s10_e17_c06_u156	(shocked) She? It's a girl?
s10_e17_c06_u157	Yeah.
s10_e17_c06_u158	(To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor) And that's enough!
s10_e17_c07_u159	And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
s10_e17_c07_u160	Oh my God! What did you say?
s10_e17_c07_u161	Nothing! What do you say to that?
s10_e17_c07_u162	Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
s10_e17_c07_u163	No way!
s10_e17_c07_u164	You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
s10_e17_c07_u165	What?
s10_e17_c07_u166	Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
s10_e17_c07_u167	Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
s10_e17_c07_u168	You really think so?
s10_e17_c07_u169	I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. (Singing) "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
s10_e17_c07_u170	Hi!
s10_e17_c07_u171	Can't a girl finish a song around here?
s10_e17_c07_u172	Hey!
s10_e17_c07_u173	Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
s10_e17_c07_u174	Okay.
s10_e17_c07_u175	Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
s10_e17_c07_u176	No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
s10_e17_c07_u177	Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
s10_e17_c07_u178	Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
s10_e17_c07_u179	Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
s10_e17_c07_u180	Ross, wait!
s10_e17_c07_u181	What? What?
s10_e17_c07_u182	Could you get me a muffin?
s10_e17_c07_u183	Rachel?
s10_e17_c07_u184	Yeah?
s10_e17_c07_u185	I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.
s10_e17_c07_u186	I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.
s10_e17_c07_u187	(touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
s10_e17_c07_u188	Oh... Bye guys.
s10_e17_c07_u189	Oh my God!
s10_e17_c07_u190	Unbelievable!
s10_e17_c07_u191	Hey, you know what might help?
s10_e17_c07_u192	I'm not getting you a muffin!
s10_e17_c08_u193	Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
s10_e17_c08_u194	Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
s10_e17_c08_u195	We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
s10_e17_c08_u196	There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
s10_e17_c08_u197	Oh my God, that's just like my name!
s10_e17_c08_u198	Son of a gun, it is!
s10_e17_c08_u199	Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
s10_e17_c08_u200	Okay, well, bye!
s10_e17_c08_u201	Bye!
s10_e17_c08_u202	Bye!
s10_e17_c08_u203	We'll call you!
s10_e17_c08_u204	Okay.
s10_e17_c08_u205	Have fun at church-camp!
s10_e17_c08_u206	Oh, look at these little bunnies!
s10_e17_c08_u207	I know! You ready to trade?
s10_e17_c08_u208	Okay.
s10_e17_c08_u209	Okay.
s10_e17_c08_u210	Alright, let's see..
s10_e17_c08_u211	We could trade later.
s10_e17_c08_u212	Yeah, I'm good.
s10_e17_c09_u213	Hey, what are you working on?
s10_e17_c09_u214	It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
s10_e17_c09_u215	How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
s10_e17_c09_u216	No, I sat in the paint.
s10_e17_c09_u217	Hey.
s10_e17_c09_u218	Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
s10_e17_c09_u219	No, and I'm not going to.
s10_e17_c09_u220	What?
s10_e17_c09_u221	Why not?
s10_e17_c09_u222	Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
s10_e17_c09_u223	How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
s10_e17_c09_u224	Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
s10_e17_c09_u225	Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
s10_e17_c09_u226	Uh, Joe?
s10_e17_c09_u227	Damn it!
s10_e17_c09_u228	Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
s10_e17_c09_u229	No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
s10_e17_c09_u230	Hey!
s10_e17_c09_u231	Hey! What do you have there?
s10_e17_c09_u232	Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
s10_e17_c09_u233	Oh my God! You did that yourself?
s10_e17_c09_u234	Honey, that's gorgeous!
s10_e17_c09_u235	You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
s10_e17_c09_u236	Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
s10_e17_c09_u237	Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
s10_e17_c09_u238	Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
s10_e17_c09_u239	Oh my God!
s10_e17_c09_u240	Oh my God!
s10_e17_c09_u241	Hi! Oh my gosh!
s10_e17_c09_u242	Hey.
s10_e17_c09_u243	Hey.
s10_e17_c09_u244	(To Monica) Hey, so what is the big surprise?
s10_e17_c09_u245	Oh.
s10_e17_c09_u246	Oh my God!
s10_e17_c09_u247	What... What...
s10_e17_c09_u248	Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
s10_e17_c09_u249	Yes, it's twins!
s10_e17_c09_u250	Oh my God.
s10_e17_c09_u251	Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
s10_e17_c09_u252	(points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at the baby Chandler is holding) and that's a girl.
s10_e17_c09_u253	Her name is Erica.
s10_e17_c09_u254	Aw..
s10_e17_c09_u255	Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
s10_e17_c09_u256	Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
s10_e17_c09_u257	Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
s10_e17_c09_u258	Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
s10_e17_c09_u259	Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"
s10_e17_c09_u260	Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
s10_e17_c09_u261	(To Phoebe) I want one.
s10_e17_c09_u262	Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.
s10_e17_c09_u263	Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
s10_e17_c09_u264	One? How about a whole bunch?
s10_e17_c09_u265	Really?
s10_e17_c09_u266	Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
s10_e17_c09_u267	Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
s10_e17_c09_u268	I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
s10_e17_c09_u269	Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
s10_e17_c09_u270	I love you.
s10_e17_c09_u271	I love you.
s10_e17_c09_u272	Call us when you get there.
s10_e17_c09_u273	I will. Ross, come here.
s10_e17_c09_u274	I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
s10_e17_c09_u275	Neither will I.
s10_e17_c09_u276	Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
s10_e17_c09_u277	So, you just let her go?
s10_e17_c09_u278	Yeah.
s10_e17_c09_u279	Hey, maybe that's for the best.
s10_e17_c09_u280	Yeah?
s10_e17_c09_u281	Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
s10_e17_c09_u282	But now she'll never know how he feels!
s10_e17_c09_u283	Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. (Looks at Phoebe) Right?
s10_e17_c09_u284	Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
s10_e17_c09_u285	Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
s10_e17_c09_u286	What?
s10_e17_c09_u287	I don't! I wanna be with her.
s10_e17_c09_u288	Really?
s10_e17_c09_u289	Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
s10_e17_c09_u290	Yeah, you are!
s10_e17_c09_u291	Woo!
s10_e17_c09_u292	Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
s10_e17_c09_u293	My coat...
s10_e17_c09_u294	This is so cool!
s10_e17_c09_u295	I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
s10_e17_c09_u296	But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
s10_e17_c09_u297	I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
s10_e17_c09_u298	You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.
s10_e17_c09_u299	Okay, guys, wish me luck.
s10_e17_c09_u300	Hurry!
s10_e17_c09_u301	Good luck, good luck!
s10_e17_c10_u302	There's no seatbelt!
s10_e17_c10_u303	That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
s10_e17_c10_u304	Alright, alright, let's do this!
s10_e17_c10_u305	Okay!
s10_e17_c10_u306	Hey!
s10_e17_c10_u307	18th and East End.
s10_e17_c10_u308	I - I don't take passengers.
s10_e17_c10_u309	Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
s10_e17_c10_u310	No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
s10_e17_c10_u311	Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
s10_e17_c10_u312	My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
s10_e17_c10_u313	What?
s10_e17_c10_u314	(screaming) Get out of the cab!
s10_e17_c10_u315	Get out of the cab!
s10_e17_c11_u316	Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
s10_e17_c11_u317	Now, that you can do.
s10_e17_c11_u318	Alright!
s10_e17_c11_u319	Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
s10_e17_c12_u320	You can open your eyes now.
s10_e17_c12_u321	Are we off the bridge?
s10_e17_c12_u322	Yes.
s10_e17_c12_u323	Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
s10_e17_c12_u324	Yes, she jumped right back up.
s10_e17_c12_u325	Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
s10_e17_c12_u326	Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
s10_e17_c12_u327	Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
s10_e17_c12_u328	You should have thought of that before you got in!
s10_e17_c12_u329	Toll-booth.
s10_e17_c12_u330	What?
s10_e17_c12_u331	(screaming) Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
s10_e17_c12_u332	Hurry!
s10_e17_c12_u333	Okay!
s10_e17_c12_u334	Okay.
s10_e17_c12_u335	Damn, that window is clean.
s10_e17_c13_u336	Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
s10_e17_c13_u337	We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
s10_e17_c13_u338	Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
s10_e17_c13_u339	Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
s10_e17_c13_u340	Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
s10_e17_c13_u341	Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!
s10_e17_c13_u342	Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
s10_e17_c13_u343	Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
s10_e17_c13_u344	Alright.
s10_e17_c13_u345	Oh God! What did I just step on?
s10_e17_c13_u346	Oh!
s10_e17_c13_u347	It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
s10_e17_c13_u348	Oh..
s10_e17_c13_u349	You stepped on my egg roll?
s10_e17_c13_u350	I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
s10_e17_c13_u351	Just put it on a plate and leave.
s10_e17_c13_u352	Okay, let's find these birds.
s10_e17_c13_u353	Alright.
s10_e17_c13_u354	Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
s10_e17_c13_u355	Oh! They're in the table!
s10_e17_c13_u356	Well, that can't be good!
s10_e17_c13_u357	We gotta get them out of there!
s10_e17_c13_u358	How?
s10_e17_c13_u359	Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
s10_e17_c13_u360	Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
s10_e17_c13_u361	Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
s10_e17_c13_u362	Joey, wait! The ball!
s10_e17_c13_u363	Oh!
s10_e17_c13_u364	Oh God! So what do we do?
s10_e17_c13_u365	I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
s10_e17_c13_u366	Okay.
s10_e17_c13_u367	No... It's all glued together.
s10_e17_c13_u368	Does that mean we have to bust it open?
s10_e17_c13_u369	I don't know. Maybe.
s10_e17_c13_u370	Oh my God!
s10_e17_c13_u371	I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
s10_e17_c13_u372	All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
s10_e17_c13_u373	Did that movie ever get made?
s10_e17_c13_u374	It did not.
s10_e17_c14_u375	Ross, where are you going?
s10_e17_c14_u376	To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
s10_e17_c14_u377	What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
s10_e17_c14_u378	Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
s10_e17_c14_u379	You have to get a ticket to get past security.
s10_e17_c14_u380	What? We're never gonna make it!
s10_e17_c14_u381	Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
s10_e17_c14_u382	Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
s10_e17_c15_u383	(with a French accent) Madame, your passport please?
s10_e17_c15_u384	Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
s10_e17_c15_u385	Your boarding pass, please.
s10_e17_c15_u386	Oh.
s10_e17_c15_u387	Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
s10_e17_c15_u388	Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
s10_e17_c15_u389	I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
s10_e17_c15_u390	Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
s10_e17_c15_u391	Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
s10_e17_c16_u392	Hey, I need a ticket.
s10_e17_c16_u393	Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
s10_e17_c16_u394	Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
s10_e17_c16_u395	We're on our honeymoon.
s10_e17_c16_u396	And the destination?
s10_e17_c16_u397	I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
s10_e17_c16_u398	I'm so lucky I married you.
s10_e17_c17_u399	Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
s10_e17_c17_u400	Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
s10_e17_c18_u401	Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?
s10_e17_c18_u402	No, did we miss it?
s10_e17_c18_u403	No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
s10_e17_c18_u404	Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
s10_e17_c18_u405	Hello.
s10_e17_c18_u406	Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
s10_e17_c18_u407	What? Hey, hey, listen..
s10_e17_c18_u408	Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
s10_e17_c18_u409	Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
s10_e17_c18_u410	Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
s10_e17_c18_u411	That's alright. Listen, listen.
s10_e17_c18_u412	Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
s10_e17_c18_u413	Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?
s10_e17_c18_u414	Isn't that cute?
s10_e17_c18_u415	That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
s10_e17_c18_u416	Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
s10_e17_c18_u417	Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.
s10_e17_c18_u418	That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
s10_e17_c18_u419	What?
s10_e17_c18_u420	Newark airport. Why, where are you?
s10_e17_c18_u421	JFK.
s10_e17_c19_u422	(yelling) Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.
s10_e17_c19_u423	And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
s10_e17_c19_u424	Okay. Here goes.
s10_e17_c19_u425	What's the matter?
s10_e17_c19_u426	I need to say goodbye to the table first.
s10_e17_c19_u427	I understand.
s10_e17_c19_u428	Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
s10_e17_c19_u429	I don't know. Except that, for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
s10_e17_c19_u430	Okay, here we go. I can't do it.
s10_e17_c19_u431	Well, I can't do it either.
s10_e17_c19_u432	Hey! Did you find them?
s10_e17_c19_u433	Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
s10_e17_c19_u434	We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
s10_e17_c19_u435	Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
s10_e17_c20_u436	Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!
s10_e17_c20_u437	Well, I've never gone this fast before.
s10_e17_c20_u438	Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
s10_e17_c20_u439	She's got her cell, you could call her.
s10_e17_c20_u440	I am not doing this over the phone.
s10_e17_c20_u441	You don't have any other choice!
s10_e17_c20_u442	Hello?
s10_e17_c20_u443	Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
s10_e17_c20_u444	Yeah.
s10_e17_c20_u445	(To Ross) For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
s10_e17_c20_u446	Yay.
s10_e17_c20_u447	Uh, Rach, hang on.
s10_e17_c20_u448	Phoebe? Is everything okay?
s10_e17_c20_u449	Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
s10_e17_c20_u450	What? Why?
s10_e17_c20_u451	I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
s10_e17_c20_u452	Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
s10_e17_c20_u453	Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
s10_e17_c20_u454	Uhm, what was that?
s10_e17_c20_u455	Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
s10_e17_c20_u456	Okay, that doesn't sound good.
s10_e17_c20_u457	I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
s10_e17_c20_u458	But she is sometimes.
s10_e17_c20_u459	Well...
s10_e17_c20_u460	Wait, what are you doing?
s10_e17_c20_u461	Well, I can't take this plane now.
s10_e17_c20_u462	Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
s10_e17_c20_u463	I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
s10_e17_c20_u464	Could I get some peanuts?
s10_e17_c20_u465	What's wrong with the plane?
s10_e17_c20_u466	There's nothing wrong with the plane.
s10_e17_c20_u467	Yeah! The left Philange!
s10_e17_c20_u468	There is no Philange!
s10_e17_c20_u469	Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
s10_e17_c20_u470	I'm not flying on it!
s10_e17_c20_u471	Ma'am, please sit down!
s10_e17_c20_u472	What's going on?
s10_e17_c20_u473	We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
s10_e17_c20_u474	This is ridiculous! I...
s10_e17_c20_u475	Yeah, okay.
s10_e17_c21_u476	Alright. My job here is done.
s10_e17_c21_u477	That was... Impressive.
s10_e17_c21_u478	Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
s10_e17_c21_u479	Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
s10_e17_c21_u480	Sorry about the table, man.
s10_e17_c21_u481	Yeah.
s10_e17_c21_u482	You gonna buy a new one?
s10_e17_c21_u483	Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
s10_e17_c21_u484	Well, at least we got these little guys out.
s10_e17_c21_u485	Yeah.
s10_e17_c21_u486	Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
s10_e17_c21_u487	I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
s10_e17_c21_u488	Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
s10_e17_c21_u489	What?
s10_e17_c21_u490	Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
s10_e17_c21_u491	I could get a goose!
s10_e17_c21_u492	You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
s10_e17_c21_u493	Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
s10_e17_c21_u494	I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
s10_e17_c21_u495	Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
s10_e17_c22_u496	Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
s10_e17_c22_u497	And you fixed the Philange?
s10_e17_c22_u498	Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.
s10_e17_c22_u499	Where is she?
s10_e17_c22_u500	I don't see her.
s10_e17_c22_u501	Rachel! Rachel Green!
s10_e17_c22_u502	There she is!
s10_e17_c22_u503	Rachel! Rachel!
s10_e17_c22_u504	Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
s10_e17_c22_u505	No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
s10_e17_c22_u506	I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.
s10_e17_c22_u507	No, no, no, but...
s10_e17_c22_u508	(screaming) RACHEL!!
s10_e17_c22_u509	Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
s10_e17_c22_u510	Okay, you're on.
s10_e17_c22_u511	What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
s10_e17_c22_u512	Okay, the thing is..
s10_e17_c22_u513	Yeah?
s10_e17_c22_u514	Don't go.
s10_e17_c22_u515	What?
s10_e17_c22_u516	Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
s10_e17_c22_u517	Oh my God.
s10_e17_c22_u518	I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
s10_e17_c22_u519	Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
s10_e17_c22_u520	Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
s10_e17_c22_u521	Miss?
s10_e17_c22_u522	I - I have to get on the plane.
s10_e17_c22_u523	No, you don't.
s10_e17_c22_u524	Yes, I do.
s10_e17_c22_u525	No, you don't.
s10_e17_c22_u526	They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
s10_e17_c22_u527	Rachel?
s10_e17_c22_u528	I'm so sorry.
s10_e17_c22_u529	I really thought she'd stay.
s10_e17_c22_u530	I'm sorry.
s10_e17_c23_u531	Well, that's it. Everything's packed.
s10_e17_c23_u532	Wow, this is weird.
s10_e17_c23_u533	I know.
s10_e17_c23_u534	Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
s10_e17_c23_u535	I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
s10_e17_c23_u536	I love you!
s10_e17_c23_u537	Hey!
s10_e17_c23_u538	Hey.
s10_e17_c23_u539	So did you guys make it in time?
s10_e17_c23_u540	Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
s10_e17_c23_u541	Where's Ross?
s10_e17_c23_u542	He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
s10_e17_c24_u543	(on the answering machine) Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
s10_e17_c24_u544	Oh my God!
s10_e17_c24_u545	(on the answering machine) Excuse me?
s10_e17_c24_u546	(on the answering machine) Miss? Please, sit down!
s10_e17_c24_u547	(on the answering machine) I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
s10_e17_c24_u548	(on the answering machine) Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
s10_e17_c24_u549	Let her off the plane!
s10_e17_c24_u550	(on the answering machine) I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
s10_e17_c24_u551	(on the answering machine) Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
s10_e17_c24_u552	Try to understand!
s10_e17_c24_u553	(on the answering machine) Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
s10_e17_c24_u554	No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
s10_e17_c24_u555	I got off the plane.
s10_e17_c24_u556	You got off the plane.
s10_e17_c24_u557	I do love you.
s10_e17_c24_u558	I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
s10_e17_c24_u559	Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
s10_e17_c24_u560	Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
s10_e17_c24_u561	Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
s10_e17_c24_u562	This is it. Unless we're on a break.
s10_e17_c24_u563	Don't make jokes now.
s10_e17_c25_u564	Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
s10_e17_c25_u565	If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
s10_e17_c25_u566	Wow.
s10_e17_c25_u567	I know. It seems smaller somehow.
s10_e17_c25_u568	Has it always been purple?
s10_e17_c25_u569	(to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
s10_e17_c25_u570	Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
s10_e17_c25_u571	Oh, yeah, that's true.
s10_e17_c25_u572	Uh, I haven't.
s10_e17_c25_u573	Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
s10_e17_c25_u574	Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
s10_e17_c25_u575	Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
s10_e17_c25_u576	Oh, okay.
s10_e17_c25_u577	So, I guess this is it.
s10_e17_c25_u578	Yeah. I guess so.
s10_e17_c25_u579	(crying) This is harder than I thought it would be.
s10_e17_c25_u580	Oh, it's gonna be okay.
s10_e17_c25_u581	(crying) Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
s10_e17_c25_u582	We got some time.
s10_e17_c25_u583	Okay, should we get some coffee?
s10_e17_c25_u584	Sure. Where?
s06_e20_c01_u001	The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!
s06_e20_c01_u002	You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
s06_e20_c01_u003	No! I won't leave you!
s06_e20_c01_u004	Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!
s06_e20_c01_u005	No you're not! Not to me!
s06_e20_c01_u006	(she stops reading from the script) Oh my God.
s06_e20_c01_u007	What?
s06_e20_c01_u008	I am extremely talented!
s06_e20_c01_u009	Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from
s06_e20_c01_u010	(interrupting) No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
s06_e20_c01_u011	Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
s06_e20_c01_u012	Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.
s06_e20_c01_u013	Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
s06_e20_c01_u014	(tremendously overacting) Fine! I'll do it without you! (Joey gives her thumbs up) I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! (Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You'll see!! You'll all see!!
s06_e20_c02_u015	(To Joey) So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
s06_e20_c02_u016	Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
s06_e20_c02_u017	So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
s06_e20_c02_u018	That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
s06_e20_c02_u019	That is lucky.
s06_e20_c02_u020	Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! (To Phoebe) Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!
s06_e20_c02_u021	Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
s06_e20_c02_u022	Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
s06_e20_c02_u023	I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
s06_e20_c02_u024	I am.
s06_e20_c02_u025	Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
s06_e20_c02_u026	You really think so?
s06_e20_c02_u027	Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
s06_e20_c03_u028	Whoa, she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)
s06_e20_c03_u029	Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
s06_e20_c03_u030	I'm sorry, what?
s06_e20_c03_u031	What?
s06_e20_c03_u032	Excuse me?
s06_e20_c03_u033	It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where it looks like he's smelling a fart.)
s06_e20_c03_u034	Oh, ok.
s06_e20_c03_u035	(there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..." (Does the smell-the-fart look.)
s06_e20_c03_u036	(on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)
s06_e20_c03_u037	I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt. Monica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God. C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! Ross: You're right, you're right, it is.
s06_e20_c03_u038	Yes.
s06_e20_c03_u039	So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
s06_e20_c03_u040	All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck.
s06_e20_c03_u041	(overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
s06_e20_c03_u042	Yeah, whatever. (Exits.)
s06_e20_c04_u043	It's your turn.
s06_e20_c04_u044	Oh, are we playing this?!
s06_e20_c04_u045	(entering, dejectedly) Hey.
s06_e20_c04_u046	Hey! How'd the audition go?
s06_e20_c04_u047	Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
s06_e20_c04_u048	Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?
s06_e20_c04_u049	Yeah, did I fool ya?
s06_e20_c04_u050	Totally!
s06_e20_c04_u051	So it did go well.
s06_e20_c04_u052	Oh, it went amazingly well!
s06_e20_c04_u053	Great!
s06_e20_c04_u054	Oh that's great!
s06_e20_c04_u055	Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys.
s06_e20_c04_u056	Oh my God!
s06_e20_c04_u057	Wow!
s06_e20_c04_u058	And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers
s06_e20_c04_u059	Oh, I love that guy! (Laughs.)
s06_e20_c04_u060	Oh-oh, what are you doing?
s06_e20_c04_u061	(stops laughing) What am I doing?
s06_e20_c04_u062	I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
s06_e20_c04_u063	Well, it is overdue.
s06_e20_c04_u064	Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.
s06_e20_c04_u065	There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand.
s06_e20_c04_u066	Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
s06_e20_c05_u067	(on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
s06_e20_c05_u068	Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
s06_e20_c05_u069	Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
s06_e20_c05_u070	Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
s06_e20_c05_u071	Don't, I like it dirty.
s06_e20_c05_u072	That's your call.
s06_e20_c05_u073	So, uh, what are you going to do next?
s06_e20_c05_u074	Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
s06_e20_c05_u075	Are they, uh, firm?
s06_e20_c05_u076	They'r alright.
s06_e20_c05_u077	You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
s06_e20_c05_u078	No really, they're OK.
s06_e20_c05_u079	You gonna slice them up real nice?
s06_e20_c05_u080	Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
s06_e20_c05_u081	Aaaahhhhhhh.
s06_e20_c05_u082	I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]
s06_e20_c06_u083	(on the phone) Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! (Pause) I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up.)
s06_e20_c06_u084	Well, what happened?
s06_e20_c06_u085	Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... (The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his hands up Phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)
s06_e20_c06_u086	Ohhhhhh!
s06_e20_c06_u087	Oh my God!
s06_e20_c06_u088	And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (The flashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)
s06_e20_c06_u089	Was it...
s06_e20_c06_u090	Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
s06_e20_c06_u091	You ate my sandwich?
s06_e20_c06_u092	It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
s06_e20_c06_u093	(getting upset) Oh-oh really?
s06_e20_c06_u094	Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
s06_e20_c06_u095	(jumping to his feet in anger) What?
s06_e20_c06_u096	Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
s06_e20_c06_u097	You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
s06_e20_c06_u098	(losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
s06_e20_c06_u099	MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
s06_e20_c06_u100	I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie.
s06_e20_c07_u101	Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for (struggles to get this out) Monica's allergies. (The duck quacks.) You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs, then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)
s06_e20_c07_u102	(startled) Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
s06_e20_c07_u103	(looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!
s06_e20_c07_u104	We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
s06_e20_c07_u105	Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
s06_e20_c07_u106	Wh?! What about my allergies?!
s06_e20_c07_u107	Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)
s06_e20_c08_u108	Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
s06_e20_c08_u109	As crazy as soccer?
s06_e20_c08_u110	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? The audition's not til 5:00! (Chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as Joey listens.) Well, nobody told me! (Listens) Who'd you talk to? (Listens and turns around to see Chandler trying to finish the message.) Nevermind! (Hangs up.)
s06_e20_c08_u111	You mean you didn't get it from this?
s06_e20_c08_u112	The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
s06_e20_c08_u113	Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
s06_e20_c08_u114	How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
s06_e20_c08_u115	I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.
s06_e20_c08_u116	Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
s06_e20_c08_u117	Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
s06_e20_c08_u118	You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
s06_e20_c08_u119	It's not that bad.
s06_e20_c08_u120	Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]
s06_e20_c08_u121	Chandler, Chandler.
s06_e20_c08_u122	I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!
s06_e20_c08_u123	Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and
s06_e20_c08_u124	And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
s06_e20_c08_u125	No! No! No! I just kissed her.
s06_e20_c08_u126	What?!! That's even worse!!
s06_e20_c08_u127	How is that worse?!
s06_e20_c08_u128	I don't know! But it's the same!
s06_e20_c08_u129	You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
s06_e20_c08_u130	Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
s06_e20_c08_u131	Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!
s06_e20_c08_u132	Name one!
s06_e20_c08_u133	(lets him out) What happened?!!
s06_e20_c08_u134	(getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
s06_e20_c08_u135	What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
s06_e20_c08_u136	Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
s06_e20_c08_u137	So--You got in voluntarily?!
s06_e20_c08_u138	I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
s06_e20_c08_u139	BEND OVER?!!!
s06_e20_c08_u140	Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
s06_e20_c08_u141	...And what did you bring?
s06_e20_c08_u142	Janice?
s06_e20_c08_u143	Janice?!
s06_e20_c08_u144	Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
s06_e20_c08_u145	What?
s06_e20_c08_u146	No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
s06_e20_c08_u147	Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
s06_e20_c08_u148	What?
s06_e20_c08_u149	Cupping.
s06_e20_c08_u150	That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
s06_e20_c08_u151	Yes, yes it is. In prison!
s06_e20_c08_u152	I said name one!
s06_e20_c09_u153	I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
s06_e20_c09_u154	Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a disgusted look on his face.) Apparently you're not very good at it! I
s06_e20_c09_u155	Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
s06_e20_c09_u156	Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
s06_e20_c09_u157	Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
s06_e20_c09_u158	Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
s06_e20_c09_u159	Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case- (Chandler gets that disgusted look back.) Okay
s06_e20_c09_u160	You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?
s06_e20_c09_u161	I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works.
s06_e20_c09_u162	It took two people to break up this relationship!!
s06_e20_c09_u163	Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
s06_e20_c09_u164	I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
s06_e20_c09_u165	What?!!
s06_e20_c09_u166	I fell asleep!
s06_e20_c09_u167	(mocking him) You fell asleep?!
s06_e20_c09_u168	It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means you are,' Y-O-U-R means your!'
s06_e20_c09_u169	Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
s06_e20_c09_u170	(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
s06_e20_c09_u171	And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
s06_e20_c09_u172	(coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!
s06_e20_c09_u173	You had no right to go out with him.
s06_e20_c09_u174	That is the most ridiculous...
s06_e20_c09_u175	You sold me out.
s06_e20_c09_u176	I did not sell you out.
s06_e20_c09_u177	Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
s06_e20_c09_u178	Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
s06_e20_c09_u179	Did you just flick me?
s06_e20_c09_u180	OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
s06_e20_c09_u181	Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
s06_e20_c09_u182	Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
s06_e20_c09_u183	OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
s06_e20_c09_u184	I know! I know! I know!
s06_e20_c09_u185	Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
s06_e20_c09_u186	Fine!
s06_e20_c09_u187	Fine!
s06_e20_c09_u188	There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
s06_e20_c09_u189	Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
s06_e20_c09_u190	Oh my God!
s06_e20_c09_u191	Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
s06_e20_c09_u192	Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)
s06_e20_c10_u193	Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what he's writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause) By dog not flowers.
s06_e20_c11_u194	Hey!
s06_e20_c11_u195	Please tell me you got the message!
s06_e20_c11_u196	What message?
s06_e20_c11_u197	The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.
s06_e20_c11_u198	What?! It's 6 o'clock!
s06_e20_c11_u199	Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
s06_e20_c11_u200	I can't believe this Chandler!
s06_e20_c11_u201	Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
s06_e20_c11_u202	Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
s06_e20_c11_u203	(angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
s06_e20_c11_u204	Oh, well I'm uh
s06_e20_c11_u205	Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
s06_e20_c11_u206	Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
s06_e20_c11_u207	Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
s06_e20_c11_u208	(shocked) That's mean! You really had me going there!
s06_e20_c11_u209	Oh, we could do this all day.
s06_e20_c11_u210	Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!
s06_e20_c11_u211	You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
s06_e20_c11_u212	You hug me!
s06_e20_c11_u213	All right!
s06_e20_c11_u214	Hey, do we do this too much?
s06_e20_c11_u215	I think so. Yeah, get off me.
s06_e20_c11_u216	Yeah.
s06_e20_c12_u217	Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
s06_e20_c12_u218	(overacting badly) I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
s06_e20_c12_u219	Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I'll just have to carry you.
s06_e20_c12_u220	That'll be a neat trick, when you're, (looks at the script) when you're dead!
s06_e20_c12_u221	Ross, you don't have to yell.
s06_e20_c12_u222	There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
s06_e20_c12_u223	I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
s06_e20_c12_u224	Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac
s06_e20_c12_u225	Yeah?
s06_e20_c12_u226	Oh my God. I mean
s06_e20_c12_u227	Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)
s06_e20_c12_u228	(To Ross) He's holding us back.
s06_e20_c12_u229	Totally.
s06_e12_c01_u001	Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
s06_e12_c01_u002	I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
s06_e12_c01_u003	Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.
s06_e12_c01_u004	That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.
s06_e12_c01_u005	That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
s06_e12_c01_u006	What?
s06_e12_c01_u007	I made that joke up.
s06_e12_c01_u008	Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.
s06_e12_c01_u009	Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
s06_e12_c01_u010	Hey, tell Dan, Thanks.'
s06_e12_c01_u011	What?
s06_e12_c01_u012	I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)
s06_e12_c01_u013	Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
s06_e12_c01_u014	No.
s06_e12_c01_u015	Seriously?
s06_e12_c01_u016	Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
s06_e12_c01_u017	Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?
s06_e12_c01_u018	Yeah, I guess.
s06_e12_c01_u019	(entering) Hey guys.
s06_e12_c01_u020	No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you.
s06_e12_c01_u021	It's my joke.
s06_e12_c01_u022	It's my joke.
s06_e12_c01_u023	Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
s06_e12_c02_u024	Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
s06_e12_c02_u025	Let's go watch it at your place.
s06_e12_c02_u026	Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
s06_e12_c02_u027	Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
s06_e12_c02_u028	What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?
s06_e12_c02_u029	No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know
s06_e12_c02_u030	Joey, why is your cable out?
s06_e12_c02_u031	I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill
s06_e12_c02_u032	If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
s06_e12_c02_u033	No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
s06_e12_c02_u034	Whoa ho.
s06_e12_c02_u035	I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).
s06_e12_c02_u036	(picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
s06_e12_c02_u037	Sure.
s06_e12_c02_u038	(with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?
s06_e12_c02_u039	Not so much.
s06_e12_c03_u040	(entering) Hey.
s06_e12_c03_u041	Wh-wh-what are you doing?
s06_e12_c03_u042	We are looking at a Playboy.
s06_e12_c03_u043	Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). Yikes!
s06_e12_c03_u044	So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?
s06_e12_c03_u045	Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, Where are they, where are they?'
s06_e12_c03_u046	Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
s06_e12_c03_u047	Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
s06_e12_c03_u048	You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy
s06_e12_c03_u049	Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
s06_e12_c03_u050	(thinks) I don't know.
s06_e12_c03_u051	Me neither.
s06_e12_c03_u052	Rachel.
s06_e12_c03_u053	What?!
s06_e12_c03_u054	I don't know. (Pause) Me neither.
s06_e12_c04_u055	You forget how many great songs Heart had.
s06_e12_c04_u056	Yeah.
s06_e12_c04_u057	You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
s06_e12_c04_u058	So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
s06_e12_c04_u059	Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
s06_e12_c04_u060	What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.
s06_e12_c04_u061	And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
s06_e12_c04_u062	(stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
s06_e12_c04_u063	Your joke? Well, I think the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
s06_e12_c04_u064	So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
s06_e12_c04_u065	Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
s06_e12_c04_u066	Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
s06_e12_c04_u067	Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
s06_e12_c04_u068	Yeah!
s06_e12_c04_u069	Well, I'm not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
s06_e12_c04_u070	Okay (he goes to sit down).
s06_e12_c04_u071	(handing Joey the bill) Here you go.
s06_e12_c04_u072	Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.
s06_e12_c04_u073	Well, if you want, you can work here.
s06_e12_c04_u074	Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just- Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
s06_e12_c04_u075	Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
s06_e12_c04_u076	What?!
s06_e12_c04_u077	Flexible hours.
s06_e12_c04_u078	Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
s06_e12_c05_u079	(visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
s06_e12_c05_u080	It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
s06_e12_c05_u081	You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
s06_e12_c05_u082	That's a good idea.
s06_e12_c05_u083	Yeah!
s06_e12_c05_u084	Do you know what's a bad idea?
s06_e12_c05_u085	Picking Rachel.
s06_e12_c05_u086	That's right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?
s06_e12_c05_u087	Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
s06_e12_c05_u088	It's coming from the living room.
s06_e12_c05_u089	(sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back to bed.)
s06_e12_c06_u090	(entering) Hey, you guys.
s06_e12_c06_u091	Monica, what are you doing?
s06_e12_c06_u092	I guess it was kinda funny.
s06_e12_c06_u093	Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're - just - kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
s06_e12_c06_u094	That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
s06_e12_c06_u095	No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.
s06_e12_c06_u096	(To Monica) Well, people are different.
s06_e12_c06_u097	Ya, you know, Rachel - she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
s06_e12_c06_u098	What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
s06_e12_c06_u099	Oh, okay, (laughing) you're not a pushover.
s06_e12_c06_u100	Oh my - you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch. (She leaves)
s06_e12_c06_u101	I cannot believe her.
s06_e12_c06_u102	I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
s06_e12_c06_u103	Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.
s06_e12_c06_u104	I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
s06_e12_c06_u105	All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.
s06_e12_c06_u106	All right.
s06_e12_c07_u107	(showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
s06_e12_c07_u108	Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
s06_e12_c07_u109	Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause I'm heading up there.
s06_e12_c07_u110	Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.
s06_e12_c07_u111	Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? Cause I'm going up there.
s06_e12_c07_u112	No.
s06_e12_c07_u113	No, thank you.
s06_e12_c07_u114	(to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, cause I'm heading up there.
s06_e12_c07_u115	I'd love an ice water.
s06_e12_c07_u116	You got it.
s06_e12_c07_u117	Joey, what are you doing?
s06_e12_c07_u118	Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a what's wrong with you?' look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)
s06_e12_c07_u119	Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.
s06_e12_c07_u120	Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they're in on a secret together.)
s06_e12_c07_u121	Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.
s06_e12_c07_u122	Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
s06_e12_c07_u123	Joey, do you work here?
s06_e12_c07_u124	No.
s06_e12_c07_u125	Hey, waiter.
s06_e12_c07_u126	Yeah?
s06_e12_c08_u127	Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?
s06_e12_c08_u128	It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.
s06_e12_c08_u129	So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
s06_e12_c08_u130	I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
s06_e12_c08_u131	Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
s06_e12_c08_u132	Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
s06_e12_c08_u133	Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.
s06_e12_c08_u134	Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.
s06_e12_c08_u135	See, now it's weird again.
s06_e12_c08_u136	I think it's great that you work here. You're going to make a lot of money, and here's your first tip: Don't eat yellow snow. (He laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
s06_e12_c08_u137	Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
s06_e12_c08_u138	Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.
s06_e12_c08_u139	Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
s06_e12_c08_u140	Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
s06_e12_c09_u141	Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
s06_e12_c09_u142	Okay.
s06_e12_c09_u143	So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
s06_e12_c09_u144	Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
s06_e12_c09_u145	Hah!
s06_e12_c09_u146	That true, I am flaky.
s06_e12_c09_u147	So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?
s06_e12_c09_u148	Yeah, totally.
s06_e12_c09_u149	Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.
s06_e12_c09_u150	Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.
s06_e12_c09_u151	That's great. Good for you guys.
s06_e12_c09_u152	I am not high maintenance!
s06_e12_c09_u153	I am not a pushover!
s06_e12_c09_u154	Who said you were?
s06_e12_c09_u155	Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
s06_e12_c10_u156	Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
s06_e12_c10_u157	No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
s06_e12_c10_u158	Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'
s06_e12_c10_u159	That's the whole part?
s06_e12_c10_u160	Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
s06_e12_c10_u161	Oh, man, I could totally get that part. I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'
s06_e12_c10_u162	Oh, excuse me.
s06_e12_c10_u163	No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?
s06_e12_c10_u164	I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
s06_e12_c10_u165	So, you'd hire me, right?
s06_e12_c10_u166	For what?
s06_e12_c10_u167	Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
s06_e12_c10_u168	Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.
s06_e12_c11_u169	It's my joke.
s06_e12_c11_u170	It's my joke.
s06_e12_c11_u171	Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.
s06_e12_c11_u172	Let's have Monica decide.
s06_e12_c11_u173	Yeah!
s06_e12_c11_u174	Yeah!
s06_e12_c11_u175	Hey Mon.
s06_e12_c11_u176	Mon, get out here!
s06_e12_c11_u177	Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)
s06_e12_c11_u178	Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
s06_e12_c11_u179	Why do I have to decide?
s06_e12_c11_u180	Because you're the only one that can be fair.
s06_e12_c11_u181	Yeah.
s06_e12_c11_u182	I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
s06_e12_c11_u183	Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.
s06_e12_c11_u184	(to Ross) Don't try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.
s06_e12_c11_u185	We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
s06_e12_c11_u186	Okay, Chandler, you go first.
s06_e12_c11_u187	Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
s06_e12_c11_u188	Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
s06_e12_c11_u189	Can I finish my story?!
s06_e12_c11_u190	See, I would never snap at you like that.
s06_e12_c11_u191	Continue.
s06_e12_c11_u192	So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)
s06_e12_c11_u193	Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!
s06_e12_c11_u194	I'm not arguing with that.
s06_e12_c11_u195	All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
s06_e12_c11_u196	You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
s06_e12_c11_u197	It's your joke.
s06_e12_c11_u198	Is not.
s06_e12_c12_u199	Hi, Chandler. There you are.
s06_e12_c12_u200	Hi, oh hi.
s06_e12_c12_u201	Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
s06_e12_c12_u202	(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and-(He falters and Monica prompts him.)-generosity of spirit.
s06_e12_c12_u203	Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
s06_e12_c12_u204	Really? I've heard better.
s06_e12_c12_u205	Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
s06_e12_c12_u206	(To Chandler) I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
s06_e12_c12_u207	Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
s06_e12_c12_u208	(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You're a little high maintenance.
s06_e12_c12_u209	Ahhh! You are on my list.
s06_e12_c12_u210	I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like - maintaining you.
s06_e12_c12_u211	(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn't even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right you're off my list.
s06_e12_c12_u212	(happily) I'm off the list. (Sits on the couch.)
s06_e12_c12_u213	(sits next to him) Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
s06_e12_c12_u214	Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?
s06_e12_c12_u215	Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so
s06_e12_c12_u216	Wow! That is a bad audition.
s06_e12_c12_u217	How-how did you lose your job here?
s06_e12_c12_u218	Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
s06_e12_c12_u219	He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.
s06_e12_c12_u220	Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
s06_e12_c12_u221	Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him
s06_e12_c12_u222	Okay.
s06_e12_c12_u223	What?
s06_e12_c12_u224	He can have his job back.
s06_e12_c12_u225	That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
s06_e12_c12_u226	That's great. Thanks Rach.
s06_e12_c12_u227	Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
s06_e12_c12_u228	(returning from the bathroom) Rach, you're in my seat.
s06_e12_c12_u229	Oh, I'm sorry. (Gets up and moves.)
s06_e12_c13_u230	Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
s06_e12_c13_u231	Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
s06_e12_c13_u232	Yeah, well, I kinda thought.
s06_e12_c13_u233	Hey.
s06_e12_c13_u234	Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
s06_e12_c13_u235	No way.
s06_e12_c13_u236	I'm not answering that.
s06_e12_c13_u237	Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I'm not answering that.
s04_e12_c01_u001	What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey's with Monica in trail.)
s04_e12_c01_u002	Boy, you are really not a morning person.
s04_e12_c01_u003	(angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
s04_e12_c01_u004	What is that noise?
s04_e12_c01_u005	You!
s04_e12_c01_u006	It's the chick! She's-going through some changes.
s04_e12_c01_u007	What kind of changes?
s04_e12_c01_u008	Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) We're getting a second opinion.
s04_e12_c02_u009	Hey!
s04_e12_c02_u010	Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
s04_e12_c02_u011	Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
s04_e12_c02_u012	You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
s04_e12_c02_u013	Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around
s04_e12_c02_u014	All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
s04_e12_c02_u015	Now, how will they know if you're ready?
s04_e12_c02_u016	Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
s04_e12_c02_u017	Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
s04_e12_c02_u018	Okay everyone, think thick.
s04_e12_c02_u019	Good-bye! Good luck! (She opens the door to reveal Monica and Joey.)
s04_e12_c02_u020	Hi! Wish me luck!
s04_e12_c02_u021	Oh, good luck.
s04_e12_c02_u022	Good luck. (to Monica) And I'm still right!
s04_e12_c02_u023	That is sooo not true!
s04_e12_c02_u024	What?
s04_e12_c02_u025	She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
s04_e12_c02_u026	I can check that for ya.
s04_e12_c02_u027	I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
s04_e12_c02_u028	Well- we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
s04_e12_c02_u029	Yeah, what's that about?
s04_e12_c02_u030	(to Rachel) And you- Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
s04_e12_c02_u031	(He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) You're good. (Tries a cookie.) These are not.
s04_e12_c02_u032	I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
s04_e12_c02_u033	Yeah.
s04_e12_c02_u034	Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?
s04_e12_c02_u035	Five.
s04_e12_c02_u036	Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
s04_e12_c02_u037	How many guesses do you get?
s04_e12_c02_u038	Six.
s04_e12_c02_u039	Challenge extended.

s04_e12_c02_u044	(to Ross) Stop that now!
s04_e12_c02_u045	Yes!
s04_e12_c02_u046	Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
s04_e12_c02_u047	Diet soda.
s04_e12_c02_u048	Yes. Yes. Yes. (They're perfect so far.)
s04_e12_c02_u049	Orange juice.
s04_e12_c02_u050	No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
s04_e12_c02_u051	Ha-ha!
s04_e12_c02_u052	They have another guess.
s04_e12_c02_u053	Okay, well, we won that one.
s04_e12_c02_u054	Okay, the last thing
s04_e12_c02_u055	Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joey's ear.)
s04_e12_c02_u056	No-no, not for like another two weeks.
s04_e12_c02_u057	I got it! Scotch- tape. (They're right.)
s04_e12_c02_u058	How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
s04_e12_c02_u059	Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces.
s04_e12_c02_u060	Aww, man!
s04_e12_c02_u061	All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
s04_e12_c02_u062	That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.
s04_e12_c02_u063	Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
s04_e12_c02_u064	Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
s04_e12_c02_u065	Serious?
s04_e12_c02_u066	Are you scared?
s04_e12_c02_u067	No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
s04_e12_c02_u068	Ross will do it.
s04_e12_c02_u069	Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
s04_e12_c02_u070	Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
s04_e12_c02_u071	No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
s04_e12_c03_u072	It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
s04_e12_c03_u073	Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
s04_e12_c03_u074	Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put em in there.
s04_e12_c03_u075	Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
s04_e12_c03_u076	Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
s04_e12_c03_u077	Um-hmm, five actually.
s04_e12_c03_u078	Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
s04_e12_c03_u079	We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
s04_e12_c03_u080	That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
s04_e12_c03_u081	Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
s04_e12_c03_u082	Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
s04_e12_c03_u083	Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
s04_e12_c03_u084	Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
s04_e12_c03_u085	Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
s04_e12_c03_u086	Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
s04_e12_c03_u087	No, I'm sorry.
s04_e12_c03_u088	Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
s04_e12_c03_u089	I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
s04_e12_c04_u090	You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
s04_e12_c04_u091	Huh.
s04_e12_c04_u092	I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing.
s04_e12_c04_u093	I know.
s04_e12_c04_u094	The test is ready.
s04_e12_c04_u095	Yeah! Yes! (They all right into the living room, all excited.)
s04_e12_c04_u096	Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It's All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (He flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him, to see who goes first.) Okay, somebody call it this time.

s04_e12_c07_u211	10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
s04_e12_c07_u212	It's umm, it has something to do with transponding.
s04_e12_c07_u213	Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!

s04_e12_c08_u218	I call Monica's room!
s04_e12_c08_u219	You can't just call Monica's room.
s04_e12_c08_u220	Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it.
s04_e12_c08_u221	Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
s04_e12_c08_u222	What?
s04_e12_c08_u223	Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
s04_e12_c08_u224	Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
s04_e12_c08_u225	(entering) Hey!

s04_e12_c08_u229	How do you feel?
s04_e12_c08_u230	Well, freaked. Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
s04_e12_c08_u231	Yeah, but I bet it works.
s04_e12_c08_u232	Really?! How much?!
s04_e12_c08_u233	All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.
s04_e12_c08_u234	Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
s04_e12_c08_u235	Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
s04_e12_c08_u236	(entering from Chandler's bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
s04_e12_c08_u237	Well believe it baby!
s04_e12_c08_u238	Well I-I-I'm not moving.
s04_e12_c08_u239	What?!
s04_e12_c08_u240	No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
s04_e12_c08_u241	You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
s04_e12_c08_u242	Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?
s04_e12_c08_u243	Noooo.
s04_e12_c08_u244	All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault.

s04_e12_c08_u250	Well?
s04_e12_c08_u251	Nope, not knocked up yet.
s04_e12_c08_u252	It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
s04_e12_c08_u253	Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs.
s04_e12_c08_u254	Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
s04_e12_c08_u255	No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)
s04_e12_c08_u256	I'll take care of it.
s04_e12_c08_u257	That's right! You do what the hand says!
s04_e12_c08_u258	How did it go?
s04_e12_c08_u259	I lost our mattresses.
s04_e12_c08_u260	(singing) "Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."
s04_e12_c08_u261	Hey!
s04_e12_c08_u262	(entering) Hi!
s04_e12_c08_u263	Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.
s04_e12_c08_u264	Oh. Oh.
s04_e12_c08_u265	Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
s04_e12_c08_u266	Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
s04_e12_c08_u267	So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
s04_e12_c08_u268	All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
s04_e12_c08_u269	Okay.
s04_e12_c08_u270	Okay. (They both squeal in expectation.)
s04_e12_c08_u271	Great. (Goes to take the test.)
s04_e12_c08_u272	Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
s04_e12_c08_u273	Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
s04_e12_c08_u274	That is not true. She did! She forced me!
s04_e12_c08_u275	Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!
s04_e12_c08_u276	Well it stupid, unfair question!
s04_e12_c08_u277	Don't blame the questions!
s04_e12_c08_u278	Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
s04_e12_c08_u279	Will you stop calling it your apartment!
s04_e12_c08_u280	But it is our apartment!
s04_e12_c08_u281	No it's not!
s04_e12_c08_u282	You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
s04_e12_c08_u283	MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
s04_e12_c08_u284	Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
s04_e12_c08_u285	Oh! (They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her.)
s04_e12_c09_u286	I can't find garbage bags!
s04_e12_c09_u287	Oh, I think I saw some in here.
s04_e12_c09_u288	What is it?!
s04_e12_c09_u289	I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
s04_e12_c09_u290	I can't believe we're living here!
s04_e12_c10_u291	What?! What-what is it?!
s04_e12_c10_u292	Did you see the size of the closets?!
s04_e12_c10_u293	I can't believe we live here!
s04_e12_c10_u294	Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!
s01_e11_c01_u001	Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
s01_e11_c01_u002	Why?
s01_e11_c01_u003	Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
s01_e11_c01_u004	Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
s01_e11_c01_u005	Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.
s01_e11_c01_u006	He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
s01_e11_c01_u007	We should do something. Whistle.
s01_e11_c01_u008	We are not going to whistle.
s01_e11_c01_u009	Come on, do it.
s01_e11_c01_u010	No!
s01_e11_c01_u011	Do it!
s01_e11_c01_u012	No!
s01_e11_c01_u013	Do it do it do it!
s01_e11_c01_u014	(Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
s01_e11_c01_u015	I can't believe you did that!
s01_e11_c02_u016	Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
s01_e11_c02_u017	I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
s01_e11_c02_u018	Phoebe, what are you doing?
s01_e11_c02_u019	Maybe nobody's tried this.
s01_e11_c02_u020	I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
s01_e11_c02_u021	Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
s01_e11_c02_u022	Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
s01_e11_c02_u023	Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
s01_e11_c02_u024	I wish all guys could be like him.
s01_e11_c02_u025	I know.
s01_e11_c03_u026	Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
s01_e11_c03_u027	He doesn't have anyone.
s01_e11_c03_u028	Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
s01_e11_c03_u029	I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
s01_e11_c03_u030	Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)
s01_e11_c03_u031	(on TV) Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
s01_e11_c03_u032	Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
s01_e11_c03_u033	No way, forget it.
s01_e11_c03_u034	C'mon, she's your mom!
s01_e11_c03_u035	Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
s01_e11_c03_u036	Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
s01_e11_c03_u037	Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
s01_e11_c03_u038	C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
s01_e11_c03_u039	You can say that because she's not your mom.
s01_e11_c03_u040	Oh, please...
s01_e11_c03_u041	Bona sera.
s01_e11_c03_u042	Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)
s01_e11_c03_u043	When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
s01_e11_c03_u044	Last night.
s01_e11_c03_u045	Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
s01_e11_c03_u046	Hey hey hey! She's on!
s01_e11_c03_u047	Ah! Nora Bing!
s01_e11_c03_u048	(on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
s01_e11_c03_u049	Your mom was arrested?
s01_e11_c03_u050	Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
s01_e11_c03_u051	(on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
s01_e11_c03_u052	Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
s01_e11_c03_u053	Shhh.
s01_e11_c03_u054	(on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
s01_e11_c03_u055	THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
s01_e11_c03_u056	(on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
s01_e11_c03_u057	(on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
s01_e11_c03_u058	Awww!
s01_e11_c03_u059	This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
s01_e11_c03_u060	(on TV) Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
s01_e11_c03_u061	(on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
s01_e11_c03_u062	...And then he burst into flames.
s01_e11_c04_u063	Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
s01_e11_c04_u064	What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
s01_e11_c04_u065	Nah... not-not special enough.
s01_e11_c04_u066	Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
s01_e11_c04_u067	Waaay too special.
s01_e11_c05_u068	I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)
s01_e11_c05_u069	Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
s01_e11_c05_u070	Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
s01_e11_c05_u071	Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
s01_e11_c05_u072	(Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
s01_e11_c05_u073	Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down) Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
s01_e11_c05_u074	I know I am.
s01_e11_c05_u075	Who's doing shots?
s01_e11_c05_u076	Yeah.
s01_e11_c05_u077	I'm in.
s01_e11_c05_u078	There y'go. Ross?
s01_e11_c05_u079	Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
s01_e11_c05_u080	Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
s01_e11_c05_u081	...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)
s01_e11_c05_u082	Anyone want me to appraise anything?
s01_e11_c05_u083	Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
s01_e11_c05_u084	Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
s01_e11_c05_u085	Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
s01_e11_c05_u086	Yeah, any messages for room 226?
s01_e11_c05_u087	You okay there, slugger?
s01_e11_c05_u088	Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)
s01_e11_c05_u089	What is with you tonight?
s01_e11_c05_u090	Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
s01_e11_c05_u091	(To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
s01_e11_c05_u092	No. It's the one he's licking.
s01_e11_c05_u093	She's supposed to be with you.
s01_e11_c05_u094	You're good.
s01_e11_c05_u095	Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
s01_e11_c05_u096	The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
s01_e11_c05_u097	No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
s01_e11_c05_u098	When?
s01_e11_c05_u099	He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
s01_e11_c05_u100	The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
s01_e11_c05_u101	No, it's you!
s01_e11_c05_u102	Please.
s01_e11_c05_u103	No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
s01_e11_c05_u104	Right.
s01_e11_c05_u105	You are gonna be fine, believe me.
s01_e11_c05_u106	Uh-oh...
s01_e11_c05_u107	Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
s01_e11_c06_u108	Hey, is Chandler here?
s01_e11_c06_u109	Yeah.
s01_e11_c06_u110	Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
s01_e11_c06_u111	Right. No big deal.
s01_e11_c06_u112	Okay.
s01_e11_c06_u113	In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
s01_e11_c06_u114	What code?
s01_e11_c06_u115	You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
s01_e11_c06_u116	What are you guys doing out here?
s01_e11_c06_u117	Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
s01_e11_c06_u118	Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
s01_e11_c06_u119	No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
s01_e11_c06_u120	Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
s01_e11_c06_u121	Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)
s01_e11_c06_u122	Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
s01_e11_c06_u123	Ross, how could you let this happen?
s01_e11_c06_u124	I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
s01_e11_c06_u125	You don't think my mom's sexy?
s01_e11_c06_u126	Well... not in the same way...
s01_e11_c06_u127	I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
s01_e11_c06_u128	Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
s01_e11_c06_u129	Hey.
s01_e11_c06_u130	Hey.
s01_e11_c06_u131	What're you guys doing out here?
s01_e11_c06_u132	Well, not playing raquetball!
s01_e11_c06_u133	He forgot to leave his grip size!
s01_e11_c06_u134	He didn't get the goggles!
s01_e11_c06_u135	Well,sounds like you two have issues.
s01_e11_c06_u136	Goodbye, baby.
s01_e11_c06_u137	Ciao, bela.
s01_e11_c06_u138	Do they wait for me to do this?
s01_e11_c06_u139	So are you gonna tell him?
s01_e11_c06_u140	Why would I tell him?
s01_e11_c06_u141	How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
s01_e11_c06_u142	Oh...
s01_e11_c06_u143	(Entering) What are you guys doing here?
s01_e11_c06_u144	Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
s01_e11_c06_u145	...What did I ask?
s01_e11_c07_u146	Hi.
s01_e11_c07_u147	Hi.
s01_e11_c07_u148	What are you doing here?
s01_e11_c07_u149	Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
s01_e11_c07_u150	I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
s01_e11_c07_u151	No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
s01_e11_c07_u152	How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
s01_e11_c07_u153	Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)
s01_e11_c08_u154	Oh my God.
s01_e11_c08_u155	You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
s01_e11_c08_u156	I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
s01_e11_c08_u157	Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
s01_e11_c08_u158	What?
s01_e11_c08_u159	I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
s01_e11_c08_u160	(To Joey) You knew about this?
s01_e11_c08_u161	Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
s01_e11_c08_u162	I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
s01_e11_c08_u163	Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
s01_e11_c08_u164	Thanks, man, big help.
s01_e11_c08_u165	(To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
s01_e11_c08_u166	I wasn't- I mean, I-
s01_e11_c08_u167	Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
s01_e11_c08_u168	I know-
s01_e11_c08_u169	I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
s01_e11_c08_u170	Chandler-
s01_e11_c08_u171	Me neither, y'know what-
s01_e11_c08_u172	I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
s01_e11_c08_u173	What are you mad at me for?!
s01_e11_c08_u174	Chandler-
s01_e11_c08_u175	You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
s01_e11_c08_u176	(Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?
s01_e11_c08_u177	Joey-
s01_e11_c08_u178	Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
s01_e11_c09_u179	Hey.
s01_e11_c09_u180	Hey.
s01_e11_c09_u181	(Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
s01_e11_c09_u182	Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
s01_e11_c09_u183	(Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
s01_e11_c09_u184	(Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.
s01_e11_c09_u185	Hey.
s01_e11_c09_u186	Hello.
s01_e11_c09_u187	Hello.
s01_e11_c09_u188	Going to the hospital tonight?
s01_e11_c09_u189	No, you?
s01_e11_c09_u190	No, you?
s01_e11_c09_u191	You just asked me.
s01_e11_c09_u192	Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can we do this now?
s01_e11_c09_u193	Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
s01_e11_c09_u194	(To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
s01_e11_c09_u195	I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
s01_e11_c09_u196	C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
s01_e11_c09_u197	(Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
s01_e11_c09_u198	Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look) 'Kay. (Sung:)
s01_e11_c09_u199	(Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
s01_e11_c09_u200	What was that?
s01_e11_c09_u201	Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
s01_e11_c09_u202	Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)
s01_e11_c09_u203	(Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
s01_e11_c09_u204	Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
s01_e11_c09_u205	Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
s01_e11_c09_u206	Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
s01_e11_c09_u207	Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
s01_e11_c09_u208	(To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
s01_e11_c09_u209	That's very funny. We done now?
s01_e11_c09_u210	No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
s01_e11_c09_u211	That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
s01_e11_c09_u212	Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee) That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!
s01_e11_c10_u213	Alright, whadyou do with him?
s01_e11_c10_u214	Oh! You're awake!
s01_e11_c10_u215	Look at you! How, how do you feel?
s01_e11_c10_u216	Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
s01_e11_c10_u217	You look good!
s01_e11_c10_u218	I feel good! ...Who are you?
s01_e11_c10_u219	Oh, sorry.
s01_e11_c10_u220	I'm Phoebe Buffay.
s01_e11_c10_u221	I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
s01_e11_c10_u222	Well, we both have.
s01_e11_c10_u223	So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
s01_e11_c10_u224	Well, actually it's just from me.
s01_e11_c10_u225	I got you the foot massager.
s01_e11_c10_u226	You know who shaved you? That was me.
s01_e11_c10_u227	I read to you.
s01_e11_c10_u228	I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
s01_e11_c10_u229	Well,... thanks.
s01_e11_c10_u230	Oh, my pleasure.
s01_e11_c10_u231	You're welcome.
s01_e11_c10_u232	So. I guess I'll see you around.
s01_e11_c10_u233	What, that's it?
s01_e11_c10_u234	"See you around?"
s01_e11_c10_u235	Well, what do you want me to say?
s01_e11_c10_u236	Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
s01_e11_c10_u237	Alright, I'll call you.
s01_e11_c10_u238	I don't think you mean that.
s01_e11_c10_u239	This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
s01_e11_c10_u240	Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
s01_e11_c11_u241	Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
s01_e11_c11_u242	No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
s01_e11_c11_u243	Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)
s01_e11_c11_u244	You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
s01_e11_c11_u245	(Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
s01_e11_c11_u246	Really stupid.
s01_e11_c11_u247	Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
s01_e11_c11_u248	Yeah. No. No...
s01_e11_c11_u249	Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
s01_e11_c11_u250	Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
s01_e11_c11_u251	You're kidding.
s01_e11_c11_u252	No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
s01_e11_c11_u253	Wow!
s01_e11_c11_u254	Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
s01_e11_c11_u255	'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"
s01_e11_c11_u256	That makes more sense.
s01_e11_c11_u257	So, what's going on now?
s01_e11_c11_u258	I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)
s01_e11_c11_u259	Whaddya see?
s01_e11_c11_u260	Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
s01_e11_c11_u261	You okay, kiddo?
s01_e11_c11_u262	Yeah, okay.
s01_e11_c11_u263	Alright. (Kisses him)
s01_e11_c11_u264	Nice save.
s01_e11_c11_u265	(Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
s01_e11_c11_u266	Mr. Geller.
s01_e11_c11_u267	Hey.
s01_e11_c11_u268	You mean that?
s01_e11_c11_u269	Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
s01_e11_c11_u270	Yeah? How'd it go?
s01_e11_c11_u271	Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
s01_e11_c11_u272	Well, howdya feel?
s01_e11_c11_u273	Pretty good! I told her.
s01_e11_c11_u274	Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go down that road.
s01_e11_c12_u275	Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
s01_e11_c12_u276	What's a 'niffle'?
s01_e11_c12_u277	You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
s01_e11_c12_u278	Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
s01_e11_c12_u279	Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
s01_e11_c12_u280	Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
s01_e11_c12_u281	Nooo!
s06_e18_c01_u001	Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
s06_e18_c01_u002	Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
s06_e18_c01_u003	Who wrote it?
s06_e18_c01_u004	Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
s06_e18_c01_u005	Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
s06_e18_c01_u006	Yeah.
s06_e18_c01_u007	Oh, cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)
s06_e18_c01_u008	A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
s06_e18_c01_u009	Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
s06_e18_c01_u010	It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
s06_e18_c01_u011	Oh, is that against the rules?
s06_e18_c01_u012	No, but it is frowned upon.
s06_e18_c01_u013	I see.
s06_e18_c01_u014	Besides, there's a big age difference.
s06_e18_c01_u015	Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90
s06_e18_c01_u016	I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
s06_e18_c01_u017	No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
s06_e18_c02_u018	Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
s06_e18_c02_u019	Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
s06_e18_c02_u020	What's a Movement class?
s06_e18_c02_u021	It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
s06_e18_c02_u022	Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
s06_e18_c02_u023	Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
s06_e18_c02_u024	No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
s06_e18_c02_u025	You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred
s06_e18_c02_u026	Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
s06_e18_c02_u027	Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
s06_e18_c02_u028	All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
s06_e18_c02_u029	Yeah so, Tuesday?
s06_e18_c02_u030	(angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
s06_e18_c02_u031	(sarcastically) Thank you.
s06_e18_c02_u032	Okay.
s06_e18_c02_u033	(entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
s06_e18_c02_u034	You just thought of that in there?
s06_e18_c02_u035	Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
s06_e18_c02_u036	(on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the gang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
s06_e18_c02_u037	You're on the phone!
s06_e18_c02_u038	(on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
s06_e18_c02_u039	Oh my God! How bad was it?
s06_e18_c02_u040	Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
s06_e18_c02_u041	Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)
s06_e18_c02_u042	What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
s06_e18_c02_u043	The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
s06_e18_c03_u044	(another professor) Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester! (Ross frantically starts to change some as a female student, Elizabeth, approaches.)
s06_e18_c03_u045	(startled) Yeah?
s06_e18_c03_u046	Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)
s06_e18_c03_u047	That was you?
s06_e18_c03_u048	Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
s06_e18_c03_u049	What time?
s06_e18_c03_u050	Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)
s06_e18_c03_u051	Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
s06_e18_c04_u052	Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through!
s06_e18_c04_u053	Oh well, it's not so bad.
s06_e18_c04_u054	Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
s06_e18_c04_u055	Oh!
s06_e18_c04_u056	My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)
s06_e18_c04_u057	(to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
s06_e18_c04_u058	Excuse me?
s06_e18_c04_u059	Joey! He's working! (To Chandler) You would look good in that.
s06_e18_c04_u060	Oh, how bad is it?
s06_e18_c04_u061	Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
s06_e18_c04_u062	How's your room Rach?
s06_e18_c04_u063	Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. (Hold it up.)
s06_e18_c04_u064	Isn't that mine?
s06_e18_c04_u065	Fine! I'm sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)
s06_e18_c04_u066	So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
s06_e18_c04_u067	(stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
s06_e18_c04_u068	(pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.
s06_e18_c04_u069	Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
s06_e18_c04_u070	Well uh, do either of you smoke?
s06_e18_c04_u071	No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
s06_e18_c04_u072	No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
s06_e18_c04_u073	Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
s06_e18_c04_u074	Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? (To the fireman) I warned her about those candles.
s06_e18_c05_u075	God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
s06_e18_c05_u076	Chandler, is that- (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler nods yes.)
s06_e18_c05_u077	(on phone) Oh that's great! Good for you.
s06_e18_c05_u078	Hey-hey listen- (Chandler waves him away.)
s06_e18_c05_u079	Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm- (Joey mimes throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!
s06_e18_c05_u080	When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
s06_e18_c05_u081	(on phone) Hi! I'm back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we'll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)
s06_e18_c05_u082	Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
s06_e18_c05_u083	Hi.
s06_e18_c05_u084	Hey!
s06_e18_c05_u085	(To Joey) We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
s06_e18_c05_u086	Ah-ha!
s06_e18_c05_u087	Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
s06_e18_c05_u088	Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
s06_e18_c05_u089	You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
s06_e18_c05_u090	No, we only went out once.
s06_e18_c05_u091	You dated her!
s06_e18_c05_u092	Not once!
s06_e18_c05_u093	All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
s06_e18_c05_u094	Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns around to see Chandler glaring at him.)
s06_e18_c06_u095	(laughs) Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
s06_e18_c06_u096	Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
s06_e18_c06_u097	(giggles) My friend's name is Joey.
s06_e18_c06_u098	Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
s06_e18_c06_u099	Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
s06_e18_c06_u100	No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
s06_e18_c06_u101	The nerve huh?
s06_e18_c06_u102	Yeah!
s06_e18_c06_u103	Refill?
s06_e18_c07_u104	Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
s06_e18_c07_u105	Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
s06_e18_c07_u106	I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
s06_e18_c07_u107	Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should get to stay here.
s06_e18_c07_u108	Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
s06_e18_c07_u109	Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
s06_e18_c07_u110	Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)
s06_e18_c07_u111	So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
s06_e18_c07_u112	I have.
s06_e18_c08_u113	This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And uh that's where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)
s06_e18_c08_u114	What's that smell?
s06_e18_c08_u115	I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)
s06_e18_c09_u116	Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
s06_e18_c09_u117	What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
s06_e18_c09_u118	Who?
s06_e18_c09_u119	Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
s06_e18_c09_u120	Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
s06_e18_c09_u121	Umm, no. No.
s06_e18_c09_u122	Yes you did! What was it?
s06_e18_c09_u123	Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
s06_e18_c09_u124	Ohh that's so sweet!
s06_e18_c09_u125	Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
s06_e18_c09_u126	(exiting from a restaurant) Dr. Geller!
s06_e18_c09_u127	(pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!
s06_e18_c10_u128	So did you sleep well last night?
s06_e18_c10_u129	I did.
s06_e18_c10_u130	Yeah?
s06_e18_c10_u131	I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
s06_e18_c10_u132	Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
s06_e18_c10_u133	What?
s06_e18_c10_u134	Gum!
s06_e18_c10_u135	Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
s06_e18_c10_u136	Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
s06_e18_c10_u137	No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
s06_e18_c10_u138	I don't use a curling iron.
s06_e18_c10_u139	Well someone does.
s06_e18_c10_u140	Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
s06_e18_c10_u141	It could've been a hair straightener.
s06_e18_c10_u142	Oh.
s06_e18_c11_u143	This is where I keep the pizza. (It's the same location as before.) And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it's spot.)
s06_e18_c12_u144	Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
s06_e18_c12_u145	Thanks Monica!
s06_e18_c12_u146	Does that smell bother you?
s06_e18_c12_u147	What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
s06_e18_c12_u148	Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
s06_e18_c12_u149	I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
s06_e18_c12_u150	Okay!
s06_e18_c12_u151	Okay.
s06_e18_c12_u152	Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
s06_e18_c12_u153	Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens) Really?!
s06_e18_c12_u154	(in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is- (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh- Uhh- Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)
s06_e18_c13_u155	We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.) (To Monica) A concept lost on some people!
s06_e18_c13_u156	So it's okay to date a student.
s06_e18_c13_u157	Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
s06_e18_c13_u158	Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
s06_e18_c13_u159	Yeah. What-what should I do?
s06_e18_c13_u160	Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
s06_e18_c13_u161	Joey that is so sweet.
s06_e18_c13_u162	(entering) Hey.
s06_e18_c13_u163	Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
s06_e18_c13_u164	I couldn't do it.
s06_e18_c13_u165	You couldn't do it?!
s06_e18_c13_u166	Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
s06_e18_c13_u167	What?! You're going out with her again!
s06_e18_c13_u168	Going out with who?
s06_e18_c13_u169	Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
s06_e18_c13_u170	Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh- (Does the international sign for big boobies.)
s06_e18_c13_u171	No, that was Dana Caplin.
s06_e18_c13_u172	Joey! You didn't even know her!
s06_e18_c13_u173	Ah whatever!
s06_e18_c14_u174	Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
s06_e18_c14_u175	Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
s06_e18_c14_u176	Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
s06_e18_c14_u177	Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
s06_e18_c14_u178	Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
s06_e18_c14_u179	I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
s06_e18_c14_u180	No-no-Really?!
s06_e18_c14_u181	Of course!
s06_e18_c14_u182	(breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
s06_e18_c14_u183	Ohh, I'm sorry.
s06_e18_c14_u184	Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
s06_e18_c14_u185	What?! Anything! Anything!
s06_e18_c14_u186	Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
s06_e18_c14_u187	Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
s06_e18_c14_u188	Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later. (He runs off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)
s06_e18_c15_u189	Hey! How's it goin'?
s06_e18_c15_u190	Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
s06_e18_c15_u191	Yes it has! I made cookies!
s06_e18_c15_u192	Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
s06_e18_c15_u193	But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
s06_e18_c15_u194	Okay. (Reaches for one.)
s06_e18_c15_u195	(pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
s06_e18_c15_u196	(gritting her teeth) Okay, I'll be out in a second.
s06_e18_c15_u197	Okay!
s06_e18_c15_u198	(opening the door) What are you doing?
s06_e18_c15_u199	That doesn't lock does it?
s06_e18_c16_u200	Oh, Joey! Sorry!
s06_e18_c16_u201	No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
s06_e18_c16_u202	Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
s06_e18_c16_u203	Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
s06_e18_c16_u204	Really?
s06_e18_c16_u205	Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
s06_e18_c16_u206	I've never lived like this before.
s06_e18_c16_u207	I know.
s06_e18_c16_u208	All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and eats it.)
s06_e18_c17_u209	What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
s06_e18_c17_u210	Uhh, I can't.
s06_e18_c17_u211	Oh, you have some studying to do?
s06_e18_c17_u212	No, I have some turning 21 to do.
s06_e18_c17_u213	Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to- (He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
s06_e18_c17_u214	What are you doing?
s06_e18_c17_u215	Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
s06_e18_c17_u216	Do you not want to be seen with me?
s06_e18_c17_u217	What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
s06_e18_c17_u218	Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
s06_e18_c17_u219	What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.) Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
s06_e18_c17_u220	Hi!
s06_e18_c17_u221	Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
s06_e18_c17_u222	That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
s06_e18_c17_u223	You are so fired.
s06_e18_c17_u224	What?
s06_e18_c17_u225	They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
s06_e18_c17_u226	Really? Its not just frowned upon?
s06_e18_c18_u227	I love it at Joey's!
s06_e18_c18_u228	Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)
s06_e18_c18_u229	(entering, sees Rachel's throw) Ni-hi-ice!
s06_e18_c18_u230	Thanks!
s06_e18_c18_u231	(To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?
s06_e18_c18_u232	Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn't say anything until Joey figures it out.) You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up! (They hug.)
s06_e18_c18_u233	Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
s06_e18_c18_u234	(entering) Hey! Hi!
s06_e18_c18_u235	Hi!
s06_e18_c18_u236	(To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
s06_e18_c18_u237	Uh-huh.
s06_e18_c18_u238	Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
s06_e18_c18_u239	No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
s06_e18_c18_u240	Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
s06_e18_c18_u241	Really?
s06_e18_c18_u242	Yeah she said something about crumbies.
s06_e18_c18_u243	No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)
s06_e18_c18_u244	(To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
s06_e18_c18_u245	That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
s06_e18_c18_u246	No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
s06_e18_c18_u247	No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
s06_e18_c18_u248	I know. I'm sorry.
s06_e18_c18_u249	All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet paper towels.)
s06_e18_c18_u250	Yeah.
s06_e18_c18_u251	God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica's.)
s06_e18_c19_u252	Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
s06_e18_c19_u253	For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
s06_e18_c19_u254	I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
s06_e18_c19_u255	Wow!
s06_e18_c19_u256	What?
s06_e18_c19_u257	Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
s06_e18_c19_u258	Really?
s06_e18_c19_u259	Yeah.
s06_e18_c19_u260	Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
s06_e18_c19_u261	Stop it! (She starts to get all worked up.)
s06_e18_c19_u262	(feeling it too) No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
s06_e18_c19_u263	Shut the book!
s06_e18_c19_u264	Let's also get a hot plate!
s06_e18_c20_u265	Hey!
s06_e18_c20_u266	Hey!
s06_e18_c20_u267	So?!
s06_e18_c20_u268	So?
s06_e18_c20_u269	It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
s06_e18_c20_u270	Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs-(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a second Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)
s02_e01_c01_u001	Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
s02_e01_c02_u002	Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.)
s02_e01_c02_u003	(seeing her) Rach!
s02_e01_c02_u004	Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him with the flowers.)
s02_e01_c02_u005	It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
s02_e01_c02_u006	What?
s02_e01_c02_u007	You're bleeding.
s02_e01_c02_u008	I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)
s02_e01_c02_u009	Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
s02_e01_c02_u010	These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly, thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country.
s02_e01_c02_u011	(Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York.
s02_e01_c02_u012	Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
s02_e01_c03_u013	No way!
s02_e01_c03_u014	I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
s02_e01_c03_u015	Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
s02_e01_c03_u016	Um, this?
s02_e01_c03_u017	Yes.
s02_e01_c03_u018	Guys, you got your hair cut.
s02_e01_c03_u019	Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
s02_e01_c03_u020	'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
s02_e01_c03_u021	(entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
s02_e01_c03_u022	Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
s02_e01_c03_u023	(to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter) You, you slowpokes!
s02_e01_c03_u024	That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?
s02_e01_c03_u025	What up?!
s02_e01_c03_u026	Everyone, this is Julie.
s02_e01_c03_u027	(out of breath) Julie.
s02_e01_c03_u028	Ohh. (Happily) Hi!
s02_e01_c03_u029	Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
s02_e01_c03_u030	And bus.
s02_e01_c03_u031	Oh my god.
s02_e01_c03_u032	The screaming guy?
s02_e01_c03_u033	And the spitting?
s02_e01_c03_u034	You gotta hear this story.
s02_e01_c03_u035	We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
s02_e01_c03_u036	200 at least.
s02_e01_c03_u037	...and this guy...
s02_e01_c03_u038	And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
s02_e01_c03_u039	This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
s02_e01_c03_u040	Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
s02_e01_c03_u041	But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
s02_e01_c03_u042	Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
s02_e01_c03_u043	(to Julie) It's an expression.
s02_e01_c03_u044	Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
s02_e01_c03_u045	And then we've gotta get some sleep.
s02_e01_c03_u046	Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
s02_e01_c03_u047	Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
s02_e01_c03_u048	Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)
s02_e01_c04_u049	Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
s02_e01_c04_u050	Yeah, sure.
s02_e01_c04_u051	Thank you.
s02_e01_c04_u052	Hey, Rach, can I get...
s02_e01_c04_u053	Did you talk to him?
s02_e01_c04_u054	Not yet.
s02_e01_c04_u055	Then, no.
s02_e01_c04_u056	So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
s02_e01_c04_u057	I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
s02_e01_c04_u058	God?
s02_e01_c04_u059	It was you, pal.
s02_e01_c04_u060	Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
s02_e01_c04_u061	Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
s02_e01_c04_u062	Well, you owe me one, big guy.
s02_e01_c04_u063	(To Ross) Here's your lemonade.
s02_e01_c04_u064	I didn't order lemonade.
s02_e01_c04_u065	Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
s02_e01_c04_u066	But...
s02_e01_c04_u067	Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So uh, what did you find out?
s02_e01_c04_u068	He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
s02_e01_c04_u069	How is that the silver lining?
s02_e01_c04_u070	You have to really wanna see it.
s02_e01_c05_u071	Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
s02_e01_c05_u072	Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
s02_e01_c05_u073	Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
s02_e01_c05_u074	No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
s02_e01_c05_u075	All right, so what were you thinking?
s02_e01_c05_u076	Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
s02_e01_c05_u077	Ohh! No.
s02_e01_c05_u078	Why not?
s02_e01_c05_u079	Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
s02_e01_c05_u080	No you're not.
s02_e01_c05_u081	I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
s02_e01_c05_u082	(answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)
s02_e01_c05_u083	(on phone) Hello? Hi.
s02_e01_c05_u084	(entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
s02_e01_c05_u085	Needs some clothes altered?
s02_e01_c05_u086	No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
s02_e01_c05_u087	Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All right, when was 1990?
s02_e01_c05_u088	Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
s02_e01_c05_u089	(on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sits down next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang up either.
s02_e01_c05_u090	She didn't hang up either!
s02_e01_c05_u091	Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
s02_e01_c05_u092	(taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
s02_e01_c05_u093	Rachel! I'll just call her back.
s02_e01_c05_u094	Okay!
s02_e01_c05_u095	(calls Julie back) Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)
s02_e01_c05_u096	(to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
s02_e01_c05_u097	Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
s02_e01_c05_u098	I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)
s02_e01_c05_u099	Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
s02_e01_c06_u100	(to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen.
s02_e01_c06_u101	(to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back.
s02_e01_c06_u102	I'm still on "no."
s02_e01_c06_u103	(poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
s02_e01_c06_u104	No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again.
s02_e01_c06_u105	What's goin' on?
s02_e01_c06_u106	Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
s02_e01_c06_u107	What stupid thing did you do?
s02_e01_c06_u108	Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)
s02_e01_c07_u109	Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)
s02_e01_c07_u110	Rachel, how did this happen?
s02_e01_c07_u111	I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
s02_e01_c07_u112	Where?
s02_e01_c07_u113	At his apartment. Is this juice?
s02_e01_c07_u114	Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
s02_e01_c07_u115	Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
s02_e01_c07_u116	Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
s02_e01_c07_u117	People do stupid things when they're upset.
s02_e01_c07_u118	My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.
s02_e01_c07_u119	Hi. Sorry we're late but we were-well, there was touching.
s02_e01_c07_u120	Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
s02_e01_c07_u121	(to Rachel) So, uh, he's back.
s02_e01_c07_u122	Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
s02_e01_c07_u123	No, not a problem.
s02_e01_c07_u124	Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
s02_e01_c07_u125	(to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
s02_e01_c07_u126	Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
s02_e01_c07_u127	Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
s02_e01_c07_u128	Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
s02_e01_c07_u129	(to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
s02_e01_c07_u130	All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
s02_e01_c07_u131	I promise.
s02_e01_c07_u132	All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
s02_e01_c08_u133	All right, that's it, I quit.
s02_e01_c08_u134	What? I didn't say anything.
s02_e01_c08_u135	Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
s02_e01_c08_u136	I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
s02_e01_c08_u137	Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
s02_e01_c08_u138	How who wears it?
s02_e01_c08_u139	Demi Moore.
s02_e01_c08_u140	Demi Moore is not a he.
s02_e01_c08_u141	Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
s02_e01_c08_u142	That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
s02_e01_c08_u143	Oh. Oh!
s02_e01_c08_u144	Oh my God!
s02_e01_c08_u145	Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
s02_e01_c08_u146	She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
s02_e01_c08_u147	Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
s02_e01_c08_u148	I know!
s02_e01_c09_u149	At least as long as I have the pants.
s02_e01_c10_u150	How is she?
s02_e01_c10_u151	It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
s02_e01_c10_u152	How's the hair?
s02_e01_c10_u153	I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
s02_e01_c10_u154	Can we see her?
s02_e01_c10_u155	Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
s02_e01_c10_u156	How're you doing?
s02_e01_c10_u157	I'm okay.
s02_e01_c10_u158	Ooh, that bad, huh?
s02_e01_c10_u159	When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
s02_e01_c10_u160	You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
s02_e01_c10_u161	Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
s02_e01_c10_u162	What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
s02_e01_c10_u163	I don't know, I don't know.
s02_e01_c10_u164	Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
s02_e01_c10_u165	(entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause) Your tailor is a very bad man!
s02_e01_c10_u166	Frankie? What're you talking about?
s02_e01_c10_u167	(entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the shoulder which causes him to jump.)
s02_e01_c10_u168	Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
s02_e01_c10_u169	What?
s02_e01_c10_u170	No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
s02_e01_c10_u171	Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
s02_e01_c10_u172	What?
s02_e01_c10_u173	Cupping.
s02_e01_c10_u174	That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandler and Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
s02_e01_c10_u175	Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
s02_e01_c10_u176	What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God.
s02_e01_c11_u177	Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
s02_e01_c11_u178	I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)
s02_e01_c11_u179	Thank you. My hair is very amused.
s02_e01_c11_u180	Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
s02_e01_c11_u181	(to Chandler and Ross) Thank you.
s02_e01_c11_u182	Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
s02_e01_c11_u183	(sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?
s02_e01_c11_u184	Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
s02_e01_c11_u185	Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
s02_e01_c11_u186	Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)
s02_e01_c11_u187	Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
s02_e01_c11_u188	That's ok.
s02_e01_c11_u189	What's goin' on?
s02_e01_c11_u190	Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all (Ross is laughing), what?
s02_e01_c11_u191	Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
s02_e01_c11_u192	No. No-no-no-no.
s02_e01_c11_u193	Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually-I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
s02_e01_c11_u194	No, I think that was the whole all.
s02_e01_c11_u195	I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
s02_e01_c12_u196	I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
s02_e01_c12_u197	You wanna do it right now?
s02_e01_c12_u198	Great! (Julie leaves)
s02_e01_c12_u199	(to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
s02_e01_c12_u200	No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
s02_e01_c12_u201	Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
s02_e01_c12_u202	You're welcome.
s01_e14_c01_u001	I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
s01_e14_c01_u002	She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
s01_e14_c01_u003	Any contact?
s01_e14_c01_u004	She lent me an egg once.
s01_e14_c01_u005	You're in!
s01_e14_c01_u006	Aw, right.
s01_e14_c01_u007	Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
s01_e14_c01_u008	Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian-I don't think we need a third...
s01_e14_c01_u009	Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
s01_e14_c01_u010	An egg?
s01_e14_c01_u011	Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
s01_e14_c01_u012	I think it's winning.
s01_e14_c01_u013	I think it's insane.
s01_e14_c01_u014	She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
s01_e14_c01_u015	Think it'll work?
s01_e14_c01_u016	No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
s01_e14_c02_u017	You can not do this.
s01_e14_c02_u018	Do what, do what?
s01_e14_c02_u019	Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
s01_e14_c02_u020	No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
s01_e14_c02_u021	'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
s01_e14_c02_u022	But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
s01_e14_c02_u023	Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
s01_e14_c02_u024	Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
s01_e14_c02_u025	Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
s01_e14_c02_u026	No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
s01_e14_c02_u027	Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
s01_e14_c02_u028	Pathetic mess? I know, but-come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
s01_e14_c02_u029	Hi. She said yes.
s01_e14_c02_u030	Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
s01_e14_c03_u031	(Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
s01_e14_c03_u032	Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
s01_e14_c03_u033	Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
s01_e14_c03_u034	...And what did you bring?
s01_e14_c03_u035	She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
s01_e14_c03_u036	Janice?
s01_e14_c03_u037	Oh.... my.... God.
s01_e14_c03_u038	(angrily) Hey, it's Janice.
s01_e14_c04_u039	Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
s01_e14_c04_u040	No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
s01_e14_c04_u041	Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
s01_e14_c04_u042	(at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
s01_e14_c04_u043	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
s01_e14_c05_u044	Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
s01_e14_c05_u045	Which one was Pete Carney?
s01_e14_c05_u046	Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) "Was it good for you?"
s01_e14_c05_u047	Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months-I didn't get to win once.
s01_e14_c05_u048	How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
s01_e14_c05_u049	I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
s01_e14_c05_u050	I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
s01_e14_c05_u051	There's more beer, right?
s01_e14_c05_u052	Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
s01_e14_c05_u053	Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
s01_e14_c05_u054	Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
s01_e14_c05_u055	Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
s01_e14_c05_u056	Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
s01_e14_c05_u057	Or?
s01_e14_c05_u058	Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
s01_e14_c05_u059	Burning's good.
s01_e14_c05_u060	Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
s01_e14_c06_u061	You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
s01_e14_c06_u062	Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
s01_e14_c06_u063	By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
s01_e14_c06_u064	That's OK.
s01_e14_c06_u065	Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
s01_e14_c06_u066	(to Lorraine) We can't do that.
s01_e14_c06_u067	(disgusted) What? What can't you do?
s01_e14_c06_u068	Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
s01_e14_c06_u069	Uh, we might be leaving now.
s01_e14_c06_u070	Tell me it's "you and me" we.
s01_e14_c06_u071	She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
s01_e14_c06_u072	Ok, you can not do this to me.
s01_e14_c06_u073	You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
s01_e14_c06_u074	(to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
s01_e14_c06_u075	I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
s01_e14_c06_u076	I hope she throws up on you.
s01_e14_c06_u077	So...
s01_e14_c06_u078	Just us.
s01_e14_c06_u079	Oh, what a crappy night!
s01_e14_c06_u080	Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
s01_e14_c06_u081	Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
s01_e14_c06_u082	So, do we have the best friends or what?
s01_e14_c06_u083	Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
s01_e14_c06_u084	I will go for that drink.
s01_e14_c06_u085	You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
s01_e14_c06_u086	Each.
s01_e14_c06_u087	That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...
s01_e14_c07_u088	Happy Valentine's Day!
s01_e14_c08_u089	Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
s01_e14_c08_u090	No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
s01_e14_c08_u091	Kiss me!
s01_e14_c08_u092	Oh, Chandler, sorry.
s01_e14_c08_u093	Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
s01_e14_c08_u094	Hi, Monica.
s01_e14_c08_u095	Ok, well, this was very special.
s01_e14_c08_u096	Rach, come see who's out here!
s01_e14_c08_u097	Oh my god. Janice, hi!
s01_e14_c08_u098	Janice is gonna go away now.
s01_e14_c08_u099	I'll be right back.
s01_e14_c08_u100	Oh, Joey, look who it is.
s01_e14_c08_u101	(in disbelief) Whoa.
s01_e14_c08_u102	Oh, good, Joey's home now.
s01_e14_c08_u103	This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
s01_e14_c08_u104	Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call.
s01_e14_c08_u105	Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously)
s01_e14_c09_u106	I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
s01_e14_c09_u107	That's funny. Who are they?
s01_e14_c09_u108	The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
s01_e14_c09_u109	You mean they're lovers.
s01_e14_c09_u110	If you wanna put a label on it.
s01_e14_c09_u111	Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
s01_e14_c09_u112	Nope, nope, that's it.
s01_e14_c09_u113	Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo!
s01_e14_c10_u114	Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
s01_e14_c10_u115	All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
s01_e14_c10_u116	Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
s01_e14_c10_u117	Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
s01_e14_c10_u118	Can we just start throwing things in?
s01_e14_c10_u119	Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.
s01_e14_c10_u120	(tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
s01_e14_c10_u121	Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
s01_e14_c10_u122	Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
s01_e14_c10_u123	(looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.
s01_e14_c10_u124	No.
s01_e14_c10_u125	Eww!
s01_e14_c10_u126	And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
s01_e14_c10_u127	Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
s01_e14_c11_u128	How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
s01_e14_c11_u129	I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
s01_e14_c11_u130	Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
s01_e14_c11_u131	Hello, funny Valentine.
s01_e14_c11_u132	Hi, Just Janice.
s01_e14_c11_u133	Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
s01_e14_c11_u134	(to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.
s01_e14_c12_u135	So, um, what do you do for a living?
s01_e14_c12_u136	Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..(Ross is watching Carol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left stranded)...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
s01_e14_c12_u137	Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
s01_e14_c12_u138	I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. (Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)
s01_e14_c12_u139	Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
s01_e14_c12_u140	(reluctantly) I guess.
s01_e14_c12_u141	Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
s01_e14_c12_u142	Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
s01_e14_c12_u143	Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
s01_e14_c13_u144	What do we got there?
s01_e14_c13_u145	A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture-Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
s01_e14_c13_u146	You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
s01_e14_c13_u147	It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
s01_e14_c13_u148	You're our third call tonight.
s01_e14_c13_u149	Really?
s01_e14_c13_u150	Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
s01_e14_c14_u151	I brought you something.
s01_e14_c14_u152	Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.
s01_e14_c14_u153	I had them made special.
s01_e14_c14_u154	Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
s01_e14_c14_u155	That's fine.
s01_e14_c14_u156	(surprised) It is?
s01_e14_c14_u157	Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
s01_e14_c14_u158	Oh no, you see, actually it is.
s01_e14_c14_u159	No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
s01_e14_c14_u160	Oh, no I don't.
s01_e14_c14_u161	Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
s01_e14_c14_u162	I did, but...
s01_e14_c14_u163	You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
s01_e14_c14_u164	Call me!
s01_e14_c15_u165	It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
s01_e14_c15_u166	You did so. I swear, I swear-(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?
s01_e14_c15_u167	Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
s01_e14_c15_u168	Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
s01_e14_c15_u169	That could be it.
s01_e14_c15_u170	Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)
s01_e14_c15_u171	Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
s01_e14_c15_u172	No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
s01_e14_c15_u173	Oh, I love you too. But...
s01_e14_c15_u174	No but, no but.
s01_e14_c15_u175	You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
s01_e14_c15_u176	That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
s01_e14_c15_u177	All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
s01_e14_c15_u178	Not her.
s01_e14_c16_u179	We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
s01_e14_c16_u180	So, um, will you bring the truck?
s01_e14_c16_u181	I'll even let you ring the bell.
s01_e14_c16_u182	Oh, my god.
s01_e14_c16_u183	See, there you go, the cleansing works!
s01_e14_c16_u184	They're nice guys.
s01_e14_c16_u185	Oh, they're firemen guys.
s01_e14_c17_u186	You guys tell them you were married?
s01_e14_c17_u187	No way!
s01_e14_c17_u188	Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
s07_e06_c01_u001	Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
s07_e06_c01_u002	Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope it's you!
s07_e06_c01_u003	I hope it's you.
s07_e06_c01_u004	Me too!
s07_e06_c01_u005	First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me
s07_e06_c01_u006	Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
s07_e06_c01_u007	Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
s07_e06_c01_u008	Yes!!! Oh!!
s07_e06_c01_u009	Hypothetically!
s07_e06_c01_u010	Still.
s07_e06_c01_u011	If Phoebe were my maid of honor
s07_e06_c01_u012	Uh-hmm.
s07_e06_c01_u013	Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
s07_e06_c01_u014	Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
s07_e06_c01_u015	Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
s07_e06_c01_u016	(laughs) Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
s07_e06_c01_u017	Wh-why is that the best part?
s07_e06_c01_u018	Because then I don't have to!
s07_e06_c01_u019	Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandler's name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that
s07_e06_c01_u020	I'm really not deciding!
s07_e06_c01_u021	Fine!
s07_e06_c01_u022	Yeah that's right.
s07_e06_c01_u023	Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!
s07_e06_c02_u024	Die Hard still great!
s07_e06_c02_u025	Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
s07_e06_c02_u026	What'd you rent?
s07_e06_c02_u027	Die Hard 2.
s07_e06_c02_u028	(looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
s07_e06_c02_u029	Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
s07_e06_c02_u030	Joey, we just saw it!
s07_e06_c02_u031	And?
s07_e06_c02_u032	And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
s07_e06_c02_u033	Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
s07_e06_c02_u034	Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
s07_e06_c02_u035	Well, John McLane had plans!
s07_e06_c02_u036	No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
s07_e06_c02_u037	What are you talking about? Bitch.
s07_e06_c03_u038	Hey Rachel?
s07_e06_c03_u039	Yeah?
s07_e06_c03_u040	Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
s07_e06_c03_u041	Really?!
s07_e06_c03_u042	Uh-hmm.
s07_e06_c03_u043	Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
s07_e06_c03_u044	Oh! Well, if that's what you want
s07_e06_c03_u045	Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
s07_e06_c03_u046	But why does it even matter?!
s07_e06_c03_u047	Why does it matter so much to you?!
s07_e06_c03_u048	Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
s07_e06_c03_u049	What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
s07_e06_c03_u050	(gasps) You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!
s07_e06_c03_u051	Yeah but Phoebe
s07_e06_c03_u052	And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.
s07_e06_c03_u053	Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
s07_e06_c03_u054	Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.
s07_e06_c03_u055	I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
s07_e06_c03_u056	Oh I know.
s07_e06_c03_u057	Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like what isn't?")
s07_e06_c04_u058	What happened?!!
s07_e06_c04_u059	Well, I don't know!!
s07_e06_c04_u060	We fell asleep! That is all.
s07_e06_c04_u061	Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go.
s07_e06_c04_u062	I think that would be best.
s07_e06_c04_u063	Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later.
s07_e06_c04_u064	Okay. But not about this!
s07_e06_c04_u065	No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Ross's hand.) Bye.
s07_e06_c04_u066	No touch! No touch!
s07_e06_c05_u067	Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she-she wished me good luck.
s07_e06_c05_u068	That's sweet.
s07_e06_c05_u069	No, it's more like a (sarcastically) good luck.
s07_e06_c05_u070	So uh, what did this woman look like?
s07_e06_c05_u071	She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
s07_e06_c05_u072	Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
s07_e06_c05_u073	Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
s07_e06_c05_u074	No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive- (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
s07_e06_c05_u075	What are you doing?
s07_e06_c05_u076	Well, let's see- (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)
s07_e06_c05_u077	Oh my God yes! Who is she?
s07_e06_c05_u078	Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
s07_e06_c05_u079	Did you break up with her?
s07_e06_c05_u080	(pause) No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
s07_e06_c05_u081	Why?
s07_e06_c05_u082	Well, cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow
s07_e06_c05_u083	Fat?!
s07_e06_c05_u084	I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow-"
s07_e06_c05_u085	You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
s07_e06_c05_u086	Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
s07_e06_c05_u087	Well, apparently she does.
s07_e06_c05_u088	Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.
s07_e06_c06_u089	Hey! What's going on?
s07_e06_c06_u090	Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
s07_e06_c06_u091	Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)
s07_e06_c06_u092	(shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!
s07_e06_c06_u093	See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
s07_e06_c06_u094	All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
s07_e06_c06_u095	Na-uh, I am!
s07_e06_c06_u096	How come you are?!
s07_e06_c06_u097	Because I cared enough to lie!
s07_e06_c06_u098	Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations.
s07_e06_c06_u099	What are you talking about?
s07_e06_c06_u100	Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
s07_e06_c06_u101	Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
s07_e06_c06_u102	Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
s07_e06_c06_u103	(To Rachel) Well, it's better than us deciding.
s07_e06_c06_u104	Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!
s07_e06_c06_u105	No! Coins hate me!
s07_e06_c06_u106	Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
s07_e06_c06_u107	Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)
s07_e06_c06_u108	Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
s07_e06_c06_u109	Hi.
s07_e06_c06_u110	Just uh, brought back your videos.
s07_e06_c06_u111	Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
s07_e06_c06_u112	No! No we don't!
s07_e06_c06_u113	Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!
s07_e06_c06_u114	I- I don't know what you are talking about.
s07_e06_c06_u115	Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
s07_e06_c06_u116	I've had better.
s07_e06_c06_u117	Okay! When?!
s07_e06_c06_u118	All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
s07_e06_c06_u119	Uh-huh!
s07_e06_c06_u120	I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
s07_e06_c06_u121	I want to do it again.
s07_e06_c06_u122	We can't do it again.
s07_e06_c06_u123	Why not?
s07_e06_c06_u124	Because it's weird!
s07_e06_c06_u125	Fine! Do you want something to drink?
s07_e06_c06_u126	Sure, what do you got?
s07_e06_c06_u127	Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)
s07_e06_c07_u128	Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
s07_e06_c07_u129	Can you figure out what I'm doing?
s07_e06_c07_u130	You're Lewis Posin.
s07_e06_c07_u131	Who?
s07_e06_c07_u132	Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
s07_e06_c07_u133	Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
s07_e06_c07_u134	No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa-. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
s07_e06_c07_u135	What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
s07_e06_c07_u136	No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
s07_e06_c07_u137	Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
s07_e06_c08_u138	Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
s07_e06_c08_u139	No, 10 is the highest.
s07_e06_c08_u140	Why is 10 the highest?
s07_e06_c08_u141	Because it's the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel you're up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)
s07_e06_c08_u142	(crying) I don't want to marry Chandler!
s07_e06_c08_u143	Okay, uh
s07_e06_c08_u144	I've got cold feet.
s07_e06_c08_u145	it's gonna be okay!
s07_e06_c08_u146	No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
s07_e06_c08_u147	Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.
s07_e06_c08_u148	(out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
s07_e06_c08_u149	Thanks!
s07_e06_c08_u150	Yes, very nice Rachel.
s07_e06_c08_u151	Thank you judges.
s07_e06_c08_u152	Ugh, what a kiss ass.
s07_e06_c08_u153	Oh!
s07_e06_c08_u154	Okay, Phoebe
s07_e06_c08_u155	Yes! Your honor?
s07_e06_c08_u156	We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!
s07_e06_c08_u157	(playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember that-(Phoebe screams and tackles him)-Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
s07_e06_c08_u158	Oh!
s07_e06_c08_u159	Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
s07_e06_c08_u160	Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
s07_e06_c08_u161	Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
s07_e06_c08_u162	It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
s07_e06_c08_u163	Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre
s07_e06_c08_u164	Go!
s07_e06_c08_u165	Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as- (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh- I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
s07_e06_c08_u166	Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
s07_e06_c08_u167	Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.
s07_e06_c08_u168	Yeah, it really was!
s07_e06_c08_u169	Aw, thanks!
s07_e06_c08_u170	Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next (To Joey) although I really don't see the point.
s07_e06_c08_u171	Yeah.
s07_e06_c08_u172	Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)
s07_e06_c08_u173	And she's back in the game.
s07_e06_c09_u174	(she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
s07_e06_c09_u175	Hello Skidmark.
s07_e06_c09_u176	(To Monica) It's a nickname, I'll explain later.
s07_e06_c09_u177	It's pretty clear.
s07_e06_c09_u178	Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
s07_e06_c09_u179	That's why you broke up with me?
s07_e06_c09_u180	You-you-you didn't know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!
s07_e06_c10_u181	All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!
s07_e06_c10_u182	Really?! I won!
s07_e06_c10_u183	What?!
s07_e06_c10_u184	I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
s07_e06_c10_u185	Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I've heard that before.)
s07_e06_c10_u186	Actually, it wasn't that close.
s07_e06_c10_u187	No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
s07_e06_c10_u188	The coins have finally forgiven me!
s07_e06_c10_u189	Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)
s07_e06_c10_u190	(running after her) Rach, it's gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!
s07_e06_c10_u191	Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
s07_e06_c10_u192	Yeah?
s07_e06_c10_u193	Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)
s07_e06_c10_u194	Why-why would I care about that?
s07_e06_c10_u195	No reason, I'm just saying that uh- That's where I'll be.
s07_e06_c11_u196	As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
s07_e06_c11_u197	Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
s07_e06_c11_u198	I would really love it if could do both.
s07_e06_c11_u199	All right, I-I have to ask.
s07_e06_c11_u200	What?
s07_e06_c11_u201	Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
s07_e06_c11_u202	What?!
s07_e06_c11_u203	Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
s07_e06_c11_u204	A hundred and forty-five pounds.
s07_e06_c11_u205	In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
s07_e06_c11_u206	Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
s07_e06_c11_u207	Well- That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
s07_e06_c11_u208	Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
s07_e06_c11_u209	How?
s07_e06_c11_u210	You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
s07_e06_c11_u211	What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!
s07_e06_c11_u212	Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
s07_e06_c11_u213	Keep going.
s07_e06_c11_u214	So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
s07_e06_c11_u215	Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
s07_e06_c11_u216	I'd carry you around in my pocket.
s07_e06_c11_u217	I love you. (They hug and kiss.)
s07_e06_c11_u218	Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
s07_e06_c12_u219	Hi Pheebs.
s07_e06_c12_u220	Hi!
s07_e06_c12_u221	Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
s07_e06_c12_u222	That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh, you mean today.
s07_e06_c12_u223	Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
s07_e06_c12_u224	Oh yeah!
s07_e06_c12_u225	Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case
s07_e06_c12_u226	Oh that's so sweet thanks.
s07_e06_c12_u227	Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
s07_e06_c12_u228	Ohh.
s07_e06_c12_u229	And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know cause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
s07_e06_c12_u230	This stuff is great!
s07_e06_c12_u231	Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah
s07_e06_c12_u232	Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.
s07_e06_c12_u233	You do? Why?
s07_e06_c12_u234	Because I think it means more to you.
s07_e06_c12_u235	But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.
s07_e06_c12_u236	Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14? (She's referring to the Halloween picture.)
s07_e06_c12_u237	No, I was ten. I just developed early.
s07_e06_c12_u238	(looking at the picture again) Man alive!
s07_e06_c12_u239	(entering) Hey, what's going on?
s07_e06_c12_u240	Hey!
s07_e06_c12_u241	Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
s07_e06_c12_u242	(gasps) Ohh, wow! That's great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited! (Runs out leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)
s07_e06_c12_u243	Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)
s07_e06_c13_u244	Great nap.
s07_e06_c13_u245	It really was.
s07_e06_c13_u246	(reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.)
s07_e06_c13_u247	(slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
s03_e17_c01_u001	Can I see the comics?
s03_e17_c01_u002	This is the New York Times.
s03_e17_c01_u003	Okay, may I see the comics?
s03_e17_c01_u004	Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
s03_e17_c01_u005	We are. He's meeting us here.
s03_e17_c01_u006	No! Rachel is meeting us here.
s03_e17_c01_u007	Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
s03_e17_c01_u008	Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
s03_e17_c01_u009	Why? What happened now?
s03_e17_c01_u010	Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
s03_e17_c01_u011	Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
s03_e17_c01_u012	Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
s03_e17_c01_u013	Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
s03_e17_c01_u014	Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
s03_e17_c01_u015	Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
s03_e17_c01_u016	Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
s03_e17_c01_u017	Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
s03_e17_c01_u018	I had the same dream!
s03_e17_c01_u019	Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
s03_e17_c01_u020	Oh, I had the opposite dream.
s03_e17_c01_u021	Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.
s03_e17_c01_u022	Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
s03_e17_c01_u023	It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
s03_e17_c01_u024	(seeing her) Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!
s03_e17_c01_u025	Hey!
s03_e17_c01_u026	Let's get the show on it!
s03_e17_c01_u027	Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
s03_e17_c01_u028	Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close.
s03_e17_c01_u029	Closer than here?
s03_e17_c01_u030	(turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let's skedaddle.
s03_e17_c01_u031	Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
s03_e17_c01_u032	Okay, your highness.
s03_e17_c01_u033	(in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. (imitating Rachel) That's okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross) Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!
s03_e17_c02_u034	(softly) Is he here?
s03_e17_c02_u035	No.
s03_e17_c02_u036	Oh. (smiles) Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
s03_e17_c02_u037	Hey!
s03_e17_c02_u038	You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they're all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?
s03_e17_c02_u039	Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
s03_e17_c02_u040	Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.
s03_e17_c02_u041	No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
s03_e17_c02_u042	Hm-mm.
s03_e17_c02_u043	Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
s03_e17_c02_u044	Ohh!
s03_e17_c02_u045	We're sorry honey.
s03_e17_c02_u046	Oh, it's okay. (starts to leave)
s03_e17_c02_u047	Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?
s03_e17_c02_u048	And heels.
s03_e17_c02_u049	(He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel, Chandler mouths Come on!') (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
s03_e17_c02_u050	No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair. (leaves)
s03_e17_c02_u051	Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.
s03_e17_c02_u052	Oh yeah.
s03_e17_c02_u053	Very bad.
s03_e17_c02_u054	Chandler what are you doing?!
s03_e17_c02_u055	Chandler!!
s03_e17_c02_u056	(jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
s03_e17_c02_u057	You're smoking again?!
s03_e17_c02_u058	Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still.
s03_e17_c02_u059	Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
s03_e17_c02_u060	Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
s03_e17_c02_u061	Weren't you nine?!
s03_e17_c02_u062	Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
s03_e17_c02_u063	Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him.
s03_e17_c02_u064	Him? Him, Ross?
s03_e17_c02_u065	Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it's Rachel again.)
s03_e17_c02_u066	Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules.
s03_e17_c02_u067	Absolutely, yeah!
s03_e17_c02_u068	Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
s03_e17_c02_u069	Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!
s03_e17_c03_u070	(obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
s03_e17_c03_u071	Wait. Really?! Cause mine get me out of tickets.
s03_e17_c03_u072	Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.
s03_e17_c03_u073	Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
s03_e17_c03_u074	Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an Irish accent) Two days of darts, it'll be great!
s03_e17_c03_u075	It'll be great for next weekend.
s03_e17_c03_u076	No, no, no, this weekend guys!
s03_e17_c03_u077	It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent) it'll be grrreat.
s03_e17_c03_u078	What's going on?
s03_e17_c03_u079	Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)
s03_e17_c03_u080	So, for the whole weekend?
s03_e17_c03_u081	We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
s03_e17_c03_u082	Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
s03_e17_c03_u083	Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.
s03_e17_c03_u084	Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay.
s03_e17_c03_u085	Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
s03_e17_c03_u086	What a pity stay?
s03_e17_c03_u087	No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
s03_e17_c03_u088	Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
s03_e17_c03_u089	Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
s03_e17_c04_u090	(to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
s03_e17_c04_u091	Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
s03_e17_c04_u092	(to Joey) Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
s03_e17_c04_u093	What? Mine aren't tinted.
s03_e17_c04_u094	Chandler!!
s03_e17_c04_u095	What?
s03_e17_c04_u096	What does the sign say?
s03_e17_c04_u097	Beam me up Jesus.
s03_e17_c04_u098	No, the No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab.
s03_e17_c04_u099	Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
s03_e17_c04_u100	Oh!
s03_e17_c04_u101	Please!
s03_e17_c04_u102	No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
s03_e17_c04_u103	Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
s03_e17_c04_u104	Oh, now I have to go!!
s03_e17_c05_u105	Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
s03_e17_c05_u106	What?
s03_e17_c05_u107	Okay.
s03_e17_c05_u108	Ow!
s03_e17_c05_u109	(to Rachel, who's staying in the cab.) Aren't you gonna go?
s03_e17_c05_u110	No. Thank you.
s03_e17_c05_u111	(getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
s03_e17_c05_u112	Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no tissue, no tuschy.' (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody's going. (She gets out and starts to close the door.)
s03_e17_c05_u113	No, y'know what don't close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) cause the... keys...are in there.
s03_e17_c05_u114	Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
s03_e17_c05_u115	What's going on?
s03_e17_c05_u116	(to Joey) My lighter's in there! (points to the cab)
s03_e17_c06_u117	Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
s03_e17_c06_u118	Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
s03_e17_c06_u119	Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
s03_e17_c06_u120	So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
s03_e17_c06_u121	Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
s03_e17_c06_u122	What?!
s03_e17_c06_u123	What?!
s03_e17_c06_u124	Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
s03_e17_c06_u125	Please!!
s03_e17_c06_u126	Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
s03_e17_c06_u127	No, not getting my bra!
s03_e17_c06_u128	If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
s03_e17_c06_u129	Okay, Monica's are the biggest.
s03_e17_c06_u130	These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel.
s03_e17_c06_u131	What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
s03_e17_c06_u132	All right then, your bra would still be big.
s03_e17_c06_u133	No, I stuff outside the bra.
s03_e17_c06_u134	Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra.
s03_e17_c06_u135	All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
s03_e17_c06_u136	(seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
s03_e17_c06_u137	Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
s03_e17_c06_u138	(finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.
s03_e17_c06_u139	Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
s03_e17_c06_u140	Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.
s03_e17_c06_u141	(opening the door) And there you go!
s03_e17_c06_u142	Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
s03_e17_c06_u143	Chandler!!
s03_e17_c06_u144	At least let me smoke it to the good part.
s03_e17_c06_u145	Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!
s03_e17_c06_u146	What, what's it, what's going on?
s03_e17_c06_u147	Yeah, this has happened before.
s03_e17_c06_u148	So you know how to fix it?
s03_e17_c06_u149	Yep. Put more gas in.
s03_e17_c07_u150	(answering the door) Hi!
s03_e17_c07_u151	(entering) Hey.
s03_e17_c07_u152	Hey, what are you doing here?
s03_e17_c07_u153	Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
s03_e17_c07_u154	Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
s03_e17_c07_u155	Where's Ben?
s03_e17_c07_u156	He's sleeping.
s03_e17_c07_u157	Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
s03_e17_c07_u158	Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary.
s03_e17_c07_u159	Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
s03_e17_c07_u160	It's not that kind of anniversary.
s03_e17_c07_u161	Ah! (realises) Oh.
s03_e17_c07_u162	Sooo!! Anyway...
s03_e17_c07_u163	Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
s03_e17_c07_u164	Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.
s03_e17_c07_u165	Yeah, well.
s03_e17_c07_u166	Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?
s03_e17_c07_u167	Oh yeah, I'd love that.
s03_e17_c07_u168	Oh, great! Me too.
s03_e17_c07_u169	I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.)
s03_e17_c08_u170	Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.
s03_e17_c08_u171	Great!
s03_e17_c08_u172	Yeah, what town are we near?
s03_e17_c08_u173	Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
s03_e17_c08_u174	(to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
s03_e17_c08_u175	Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
s03_e17_c08_u176	Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel) There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?
s03_e17_c08_u177	I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
s03_e17_c08_u178	Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don't do that.
s03_e17_c08_u179	Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
s03_e17_c08_u180	Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
s03_e17_c08_u181	No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
s03_e17_c08_u182	But if...
s03_e17_c08_u183	No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else.
s03_e17_c08_u184	Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
s03_e17_c08_u185	So the going for help went well?
s03_e17_c08_u186	Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
s03_e17_c08_u187	I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)
s03_e17_c08_u188	Then why are you smoking?
s03_e17_c08_u189	Well it's very unsettling.
s03_e17_c09_u190	....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.
s03_e17_c09_u191	Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
s03_e17_c09_u192	(looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where's 717? (He gets up to return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross grabs the last piece.) Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?
s03_e17_c09_u193	No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something.
s03_e17_c09_u194	(answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.
s03_e17_c09_u195	Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
s03_e17_c09_u196	I ate a bug.
s03_e17_c09_u197	(running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)
s03_e17_c09_u198	Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
s03_e17_c09_u199	Oh, now you want a favour?
s03_e17_c09_u200	Yes, please.
s03_e17_c09_u201	Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
s03_e17_c09_u202	(running over and grabbing the phone away from Ross) (on phone) Phoebe, hang on a second. (Hands Ross her keys) Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
s03_e17_c09_u203	No, I'm not gonna pick them up.
s03_e17_c09_u204	Listen, we both know you're gonna do it cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
s03_e17_c09_u205	No, Rachel doesn't want me to....
s03_e17_c09_u206	Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
s03_e17_c09_u207	Yeah, you're right.
s03_e17_c09_u208	(on phone) Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. (listens) What? (listens) (to Ross) You slept with someone else?!
s03_e17_c09_u209	We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms down) yeah. Where are you? I'll find you. (hangs up)
s03_e17_c09_u210	You slept with another woman?
s03_e17_c09_u211	Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk.
s03_e17_c10_u212	Okay, done.
s03_e17_c10_u213	(reading the sign) What's pleh'?
s03_e17_c10_u214	That's help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
s03_e17_c10_u215	Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
s03_e17_c10_u216	(all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it's Ross) Ugh!!!
s03_e17_c10_u217	Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
s03_e17_c10_u218	Hey!!
s03_e17_c10_u219	Hi!
s03_e17_c10_u220	What is he doing here?!
s03_e17_c10_u221	He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
s03_e17_c10_u222	No! Come on!
s03_e17_c10_u223	All right!! Fine! Fine.
s03_e17_c10_u224	Arrrghh!!
s03_e17_c10_u225	Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!
s03_e17_c10_u226	(to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
s03_e17_c10_u227	Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.
s03_e17_c10_u228	Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
s03_e17_c10_u229	I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
s03_e17_c10_u230	Ask me what?
s03_e17_c10_u231	Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
s03_e17_c10_u232	No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no.
s03_e17_c10_u233	You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
s03_e17_c10_u234	Excuse me?
s03_e17_c10_u235	It's horrible.
s03_e17_c10_u236	(sarcastic) Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
s03_e17_c10_u237	Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
s03_e17_c10_u238	Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
s03_e17_c10_u239	Here we go again.
s03_e17_c10_u240	I-I can't handle this, you guys.
s03_e17_c10_u241	Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name.
s03_e17_c10_u242	All right Pheebs, your cab's ready.
s03_e17_c10_u243	All right, let's go!
s03_e17_c10_u244	You're welcome.
s03_e17_c10_u245	Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
s03_e17_c10_u246	We were on a break!
s03_e17_c10_u247	Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
s03_e17_c10_u248	Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
s03_e17_c10_u249	(to Monica) What?!
s03_e17_c10_u250	(shyly) I don't know.
s03_e17_c10_u251	That's what you said last night.
s03_e17_c10_u252	What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!
s03_e17_c10_u253	Okay.
s03_e17_c10_u254	Really Joey?
s03_e17_c10_u255	(pause) What?
s03_e17_c10_u256	Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
s03_e17_c10_u257	No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
s03_e17_c10_u258	Obviously not to Joey.
s03_e17_c10_u259	(pause) What?
s03_e17_c10_u260	(to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
s03_e17_c10_u261	Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)
s03_e17_c10_u262	Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues to dance.) Look what you're doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts to leave) You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
s03_e17_c10_u263	Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
s03_e17_c10_u264	Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you be civil?
s03_e17_c10_u265	Yeah.
s03_e17_c10_u266	I can.
s03_e17_c10_u267	Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
s03_e17_c10_u268	Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
s03_e17_c10_u269	Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross cuts him off.) No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
s03_e17_c10_u270	Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
s03_e17_c10_u271	No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise.
s03_e17_c10_u272	Thank you.
s03_e17_c10_u273	All right, we'll call you when we get back.
s03_e17_c10_u274	Okay.
s03_e17_c10_u275	Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
s03_e17_c10_u276	Okay.
s03_e17_c10_u277	Or, or the rodeo!!
s03_e17_c10_u278	That would be great.
s03_e17_c10_u279	Okay!
s03_e17_c10_u280	I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
s03_e17_c10_u281	I know!
s03_e17_c10_u282	Bye!!!
s03_e17_c11_u283	(looking through the peephole) Ugh. (opening the door) Ross!
s03_e17_c11_u284	(entering) Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
s03_e17_c11_u285	Ahh, nooo!!
s03_e17_c11_u286	Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, cause that's not where you want to skimp.
s03_e17_c11_u287	You're a genius, Ross.
s03_e17_c11_u288	Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
s03_e17_c11_u289	Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow. (pushes him out the door)
s03_e17_c11_u290	Okay.
s03_e17_c11_u291	Okay, bye!!
s03_e17_c11_u292	So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
s03_e17_c11_u293	Yeah, okay, bye. (closes the door, turns out the lights, and runs back to the bedroom)
s03_e17_c11_u294	(outside the door) So I'm gonna take off then!
s03_e23_c01_u001	Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
s03_e23_c01_u002	Or... Dick.
s03_e23_c01_u003	(entering) Hey.
s03_e23_c01_u004	Hey.
s03_e23_c01_u005	Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
s03_e23_c01_u006	Was it like a sneeze only better?
s03_e23_c01_u007	No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
s03_e23_c01_u008	(with a disgusted look) What was it?
s03_e23_c01_u009	Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. (starts to take off his pants)
s03_e23_c01_u010	Whoa!!!
s03_e23_c01_u011	No!!
s03_e23_c01_u012	Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his thing.)
s03_e23_c01_u013	Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.
s03_e23_c01_u014	Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump back.)
s03_e23_c01_u015	No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
s03_e23_c01_u016	Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
s03_e23_c01_u017	No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a
s03_e23_c01_u018	(entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're doing and stops, the guys are stunned)
s03_e23_c01_u019	Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.
s03_e23_c01_u020	Ahhh.
s03_e23_c01_u021	Yeah, right.
s03_e23_c02_u022	(to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. (points to the stage)
s03_e23_c02_u023	Good deal.
s03_e23_c02_u024	Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
s03_e23_c02_u025	Hi!
s03_e23_c02_u026	Hey!
s03_e23_c02_u027	Hey!
s03_e23_c02_u028	Vince is a fireman.
s03_e23_c02_u029	Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
s03_e23_c02_u030	98 hot saves, highest in the force.
s03_e23_c02_u031	Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
s03_e23_c02_u032	(dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son.
s03_e23_c02_u033	You're right, I know.
s03_e23_c02_u034	(to Phoebe) Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. (kisses her) See you Saturday. (leaves)
s03_e23_c02_u035	Okay. (watches him leave)
s03_e23_c02_u036	Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
s03_e23_c02_u037	Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
s03_e23_c02_u038	What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
s03_e23_c02_u039	I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
s03_e23_c02_u040	So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
s03_e23_c02_u041	Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know' face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.
s03_e23_c02_u042	(entering) Hey guys!
s03_e23_c02_u043	Hey.
s03_e23_c02_u044	Hi!
s03_e23_c02_u045	(going over to him) Well?!
s03_e23_c02_u046	(joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
s03_e23_c02_u047	Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
s03_e23_c02_u048	Well what is it?!
s03_e23_c02_u049	He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
s03_e23_c02_u050	Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
s03_e23_c02_u051	At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
s03_e23_c02_u052	Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
s03_e23_c02_u053	(sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!
s03_e23_c02_u054	Pete's breaking up with me.
s03_e23_c02_u055	What?!
s03_e23_c02_u056	I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
s03_e23_c02_u057	And?
s03_e23_c02_u058	Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
s03_e23_c02_u059	Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
s03_e23_c02_u060	Really?!
s03_e23_c02_u061	Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
s03_e23_c03_u062	...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
s03_e23_c03_u063	That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught on fire) Oh my God!
s03_e23_c03_u064	Whoa!
s03_e23_c03_u065	(the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!
s03_e23_c03_u066	Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
s03_e23_c03_u067	(stopping him) No! No!
s03_e23_c03_u068	No, no?
s03_e23_c03_u069	Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
s03_e23_c03_u070	W-w-w-wait! Why?!
s03_e23_c03_u071	Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she drags him away)
s03_e23_c04_u072	Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
s03_e23_c04_u073	Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. (Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?
s03_e23_c04_u074	Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
s03_e23_c04_u075	Well that's not a third nipple.
s03_e23_c04_u076	No?
s03_e23_c04_u077	First of all, it's on your ass.
s03_e23_c04_u078	Well then, what is it?!
s03_e23_c04_u079	Wait a minute, hold it. (He goes to the door and opens it.) Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
s03_e23_c04_u080	I'm with Hamilton!
s03_e23_c04_u081	He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
s03_e23_c05_u082	(starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
s03_e23_c05_u083	Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
s03_e23_c05_u084	Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
s03_e23_c05_u085	(entering with Rachel) -and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
s03_e23_c05_u086	Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
s03_e23_c05_u087	(disgusted) Uh.
s03_e23_c05_u088	Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
s03_e23_c05_u089	Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
s03_e23_c05_u090	So Pheebs, pick one of them.
s03_e23_c05_u091	Yeah. Which one do you like more?
s03_e23_c05_u092	Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)
s03_e23_c05_u093	Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
s03_e23_c05_u094	Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
s03_e23_c05_u095	Well sensitive is important, pick him.
s03_e23_c05_u096	Yeah.
s03_e23_c05_u097	Oh sure, go with the sissy.
s03_e23_c05_u098	Jason is not a sissy!
s03_e23_c05_u099	Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
s03_e23_c06_u100	Y'know I have dinner plans!!
s03_e23_c06_u101	Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
s03_e23_c06_u102	Whoa. (they all lean in to get a closer look, Ross isn't pleased)
s03_e23_c07_u103	Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
s03_e23_c07_u104	Yes, and the dimmer switch.
s03_e23_c07_u105	Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
s03_e23_c07_u106	No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
s03_e23_c07_u107	(sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.
s03_e23_c07_u108	(entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.
s03_e23_c07_u109	God, that is the nicest kitchen.
s03_e23_c07_u110	I know.
s03_e23_c07_u111	No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
s03_e23_c07_u112	Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
s03_e23_c07_u113	Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically answers it)
s03_e23_c07_u114	Monica? (the gang ducks and hides)
s03_e23_c07_u115	I guess that's how.
s03_e23_c07_u116	Hey Monica, how's it going.
s03_e23_c07_u117	Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants.
s03_e23_c07_u118	Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
s03_e23_c07_u119	(standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
s03_e23_c07_u120	I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.
s03_e23_c07_u121	(standing up) Hey Pete.
s03_e23_c07_u122	Hi, how ya doing?
s03_e23_c07_u123	Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
s03_e23_c07_u124	Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. (clicks his remote) (to his other call) Hey, how's it going?
s03_e23_c07_u125	Oh no-no-no, it's still me.
s03_e23_c07_u126	Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here. (to other caller) Yeah. (listens) Yeah, okay. I'm gonna have to call you back later. (pause) Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
s03_e23_c07_u127	Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.
s03_e23_c07_u128	Okay, I love you.
s03_e23_c07_u129	I love you.
s03_e23_c07_u130	I love you, love you.
s03_e23_c07_u131	Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
s03_e23_c07_u132	So, what do you thing the good news is?
s03_e23_c07_u133	(looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
s03_e23_c07_u134	Oh my.
s03_e23_c07_u135	Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
s03_e23_c07_u136	Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
s03_e23_c07_u137	Hello.
s03_e23_c07_u138	And that's Pete's Mom.
s03_e23_c08_u139	Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, Look how much money we've got! Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
s03_e23_c08_u140	Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
s03_e23_c08_u141	Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
s03_e23_c08_u142	Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
s03_e23_c08_u143	Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
s03_e23_c08_u144	Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
s03_e23_c08_u145	All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
s03_e23_c08_u146	Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
s03_e23_c08_u147	Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
s03_e23_c08_u148	Good luck!
s03_e23_c08_u149	OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
s03_e23_c09_u150	Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
s03_e23_c09_u151	Oh sure. Vince?!
s03_e23_c09_u152	Yo!! (slides down that pole that fire station's have)
s03_e23_c09_u153	Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
s03_e23_c09_u154	So, what's up?
s03_e23_c09_u155	Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
s03_e23_c09_u156	Uh-huh. G-good deal.
s03_e23_c09_u157	I'm sorry.
s03_e23_c09_u158	No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and- (starts choking up) That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
s03_e23_c09_u159	Oh my God, I didn't
s03_e23_c09_u160	(starting to cry) I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal. (walks away)
s03_e23_c09_u161	(running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
s03_e23_c10_u162	(to Ross) I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
s03_e23_c10_u163	Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
s03_e23_c10_u164	Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
s03_e23_c10_u165	Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist's card and leaves.)
s03_e23_c10_u166	(entering) Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
s03_e23_c10_u167	Brides magazines?
s03_e23_c10_u168	Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the picture.)
s03_e23_c10_u169	(gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both look at her.) Like for clubbing.
s03_e23_c10_u170	It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
s03_e23_c10_u171	Oh my God. (starting to cry)
s03_e23_c10_u172	I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)
s03_e23_c10_u173	Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
s03_e23_c10_u174	You didn't break up with that fireman?
s03_e23_c10_u175	No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
s03_e23_c10_u176	Wow!
s03_e23_c10_u177	Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
s03_e23_c10_u178	So then, are you going to dump Jason?
s03_e23_c10_u179	Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and- Okay so Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so's Vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince side) So- It's really just about the math.
s03_e23_c11_u180	(knocks on the door) Jason?
s03_e23_c11_u181	Yeah, come on in.
s03_e23_c11_u182	So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
s03_e23_c11_u183	Nah-ha!
s03_e23_c12_u184	You must be Ross.
s03_e23_c12_u185	Hi.
s03_e23_c12_u186	I am Guru Saj. (takes the drawer back and replaces)
s03_e23_c12_u187	Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...
s03_e23_c12_u188	Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. (motions to the table) Come on, have a seat. (looks at it) Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!
s03_e23_c12_u189	What's a koondis?
s03_e23_c12_u190	I don't know, what's a koondis with you? (starts laughing as if that joke was funny, Ross only looks at him, and he stops) Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
s03_e23_c12_u191	I guess it's worth a try.
s03_e23_c12_u192	Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!! (quickly wipes it off)
s03_e23_c12_u193	What?! What?!
s03_e23_c12_u194	We appear to have angered it.
s03_e23_c12_u195	We?! We angered it?!
s03_e23_c12_u196	Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. (Ross gives him a What?' look) Love.
s03_e23_c12_u197	Oh God!
s03_e23_c12_u198	(He starts moving his hands around in circles above the thing.) Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to
s03_e23_c12_u199	Ow!!
s03_e23_c12_u200	Oops.
s03_e23_c12_u201	What was, what was that?
s03_e23_c12_u202	Well it's gone.
s03_e23_c12_u203	What?! How's that?
s03_e23_c12_u204	It got caught on my watch.
s03_e23_c12_u205	Hey! (congratulates him)
s03_e23_c13_u206	Lights. (The lights turn on, once again they're too bright.) Uh, romantic lights. (The lights dim.)
s03_e23_c13_u207	Ooh, nice.
s03_e23_c13_u208	So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
s03_e23_c13_u209	Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
s03_e23_c13_u210	Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life
s03_e23_c13_u211	Yeah?
s03_e23_c13_u212	And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
s03_e23_c13_u213	Wow.
s03_e23_c13_u214	There's one thing missing.
s03_e23_c13_u215	What's that?
s03_e23_c13_u216	It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
s03_e23_c13_u217	Okay. (not sure of herself)
s03_e23_c13_u218	Monica, I want to become (pause) the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
s03_e23_c13_u219	You wanna what?!
s03_e23_c13_u220	I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!
s03_e23_c13_u221	What are you talking about?
s03_e23_c13_u222	Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed.
s03_e23_c13_u223	And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
s03_e23_c13_u224	Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
s03_e23_c13_u225	My parents will be so happy.
s03_e23_c14_u226	(singing) Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. (Jason enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear- (In her head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. (She tries to continue the song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.
s03_e23_c14_u227	(going up to her) Hey. I was
s03_e23_c14_u228	Hey!
s03_e23_c14_u229	I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there. (kisses her)
s03_e23_c14_u230	(running over) Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
s03_e23_c14_u231	I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!
s03_e23_c14_u232	What?!
s03_e23_c14_u233	What?!
s03_e23_c14_u234	Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
s03_e23_c14_u235	Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
s03_e23_c14_u236	Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break.
s03_e23_c14_u237	Really?!
s03_e23_c14_u238	Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh.
s03_e23_c14_u239	You haven't?
s03_e23_c14_u240	You have?
s03_e23_c14_u241	Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)
s03_e23_c14_u242	(to Phoebe) I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
s03_e23_c14_u243	Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
s03_e23_c14_u244	Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you. (walks out)
s03_e23_c14_u245	(to Vince) Well, that could've been really awkward.
s03_e23_c14_u246	You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
s03_e23_c14_u247	Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
s03_e23_c14_u248	Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area. (walks out)
s03_e23_c15_u249	(comforting the duck) Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
s03_e23_c15_u250	(entering) Hello, I am Guru Saj-(sees the duck)-Whoa!! (to Joey) That's supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
s03_e23_c15_u251	Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
s03_e23_c15_u252	Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
s07_e11_c01_u001	Ohh. Mmm.
s07_e11_c01_u002	(Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.
s07_e11_c01_u003	Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
s07_e11_c01_u004	Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I-(Chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)-Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to look at the label on the box.)
s07_e11_c01_u005	(nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
s07_e11_c01_u006	Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.
s07_e11_c01_u007	I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
s07_e11_c01_u008	Why, why not?
s07_e11_c01_u009	Because it's too delicious.
s07_e11_c01_u010	Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
s07_e11_c01_u011	No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (Reading the label) Momma's Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
s07_e11_c01_u012	(taking a bite) Oh, I'm sorry what?
s07_e11_c02_u013	All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
s07_e11_c02_u014	So
s07_e11_c02_u015	Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
s07_e11_c02_u016	Absolutely!
s07_e11_c02_u017	I'll see you at 8:00.
s07_e11_c02_u018	Okay. (Joey exits.)
s07_e11_c02_u019	Oh, what's at 8:00?
s07_e11_c02_u020	Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
s07_e11_c02_u021	Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
s07_e11_c02_u022	Duly noted.
s07_e11_c02_u023	Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
s07_e11_c02_u024	What are you talking about?
s07_e11_c02_u025	Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
s07_e11_c02_u026	You were invited?!
s07_e11_c02_u027	No.
s07_e11_c02_u028	My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
s07_e11_c02_u029	Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
s07_e11_c02_u030	Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
s07_e11_c02_u031	Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
s07_e11_c02_u032	Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
s07_e11_c02_u033	I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then sushes him.)
s07_e11_c03_u034	Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
s07_e11_c03_u035	Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
s07_e11_c03_u036	Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)
s07_e11_c03_u037	(reading the note) "Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?
s07_e11_c03_u038	Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
s07_e11_c03_u039	Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica shakes her head in disgust.)
s07_e11_c03_u040	(entering) Hey!
s07_e11_c03_u041	Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
s07_e11_c03_u042	Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
s07_e11_c03_u043	So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
s07_e11_c03_u044	Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
s07_e11_c03_u045	Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
s07_e11_c03_u046	I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their friendship) is for life!
s07_e11_c03_u047	Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
s07_e11_c03_u048	Well, it does.
s07_e11_c03_u049	Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. (They hug.) How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
s07_e11_c03_u050	Okay, you wore me down.
s07_e11_c03_u051	Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
s07_e11_c03_u052	The Ross-Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)
s07_e11_c04_u053	Hi!
s07_e11_c04_u054	Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
s07_e11_c04_u055	So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
s07_e11_c04_u056	I can't seem to say goodbye.
s07_e11_c04_u057	Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
s07_e11_c04_u058	Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
s07_e11_c04_u059	It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling- (Pause) Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
s07_e11_c04_u060	(closing the box) Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
s07_e11_c04_u061	Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
s07_e11_c04_u062	Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
s07_e11_c04_u063	Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the cheesecake.)
s07_e11_c05_u064	Awww! Mel Torme died.
s07_e11_c05_u065	Joey, that paper's like a year old!
s07_e11_c05_u066	Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
s07_e11_c05_u067	(entering) Hey.
s07_e11_c05_u068	Hey.
s07_e11_c05_u069	Hey.
s07_e11_c05_u070	So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
s07_e11_c05_u071	Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
s07_e11_c05_u072	Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
s07_e11_c05_u073	(disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
s07_e11_c05_u074	Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
s07_e11_c05_u075	Joan?
s07_e11_c05_u076	Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
s07_e11_c05_u077	Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
s07_e11_c05_u078	Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back
s07_e11_c05_u079	(interrupting) Not broad backed!
s07_e11_c05_u080	Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
s07_e11_c05_u081	What? I can't cancel on Joan!
s07_e11_c05_u082	Why not?!
s07_e11_c05_u083	Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
s07_e11_c05_u084	Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
s07_e11_c05_u085	Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan. (Does so.)
s07_e11_c05_u086	Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
s07_e11_c05_u087	(laughs) We'll see.
s07_e11_c06_u088	Well, thank you for lunch.
s07_e11_c06_u089	What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
s07_e11_c06_u090	So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?
s07_e11_c06_u091	(gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman is still lying in front of her door.)
s07_e11_c06_u092	Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
s07_e11_c06_u093	She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
s07_e11_c06_u094	By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
s07_e11_c06_u095	No that could kill her.
s07_e11_c06_u096	Well, we don't want that.
s07_e11_c06_u097	No so we're protecting her.
s07_e11_c06_u098	But we should take it.
s07_e11_c06_u099	But we should move quick.
s07_e11_c06_u100	Why?
s07_e11_c06_u101	Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
s07_e11_c06_u102	Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)
s07_e11_c07_u103	(gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! That's David!
s07_e11_c07_u104	David who?
s07_e11_c07_u105	David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
s07_e11_c07_u106	(noticing Phoebe) Oh my God!
s07_e11_c07_u107	Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
s07_e11_c07_u108	Phoebe?
s07_e11_c07_u109	David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
s07_e11_c07_u110	Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
s07_e11_c07_u111	Well- Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
s07_e11_c07_u112	Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
s07_e11_c07_u113	Yeah.
s07_e11_c07_u114	Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make
s07_e11_c07_u115	Uh-huh.
s07_e11_c07_u116	Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
s07_e11_c07_u117	Well, of course I would want to see you. I-I think about you all the time.
s07_e11_c07_u118	Really? Because I think about you all the time.
s07_e11_c07_u119	Really?
s07_e11_c07_u120	I mean, there's a statue in Minsk
s07_e11_c07_u121	Uh-huh.
s07_e11_c07_u122	That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles
s07_e11_c07_u123	Yeah.
s07_e11_c07_u124	Umm, anyway-Do you want to have dinner tonight?
s07_e11_c07_u125	(excited) Yes! Oh no!
s07_e11_c07_u126	(disappointed) Oh. Uh, what?
s07_e11_c07_u127	I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
s07_e11_c07_u128	Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm
s07_e11_c07_u129	Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
s07_e11_c07_u130	Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)
s07_e11_c07_u131	What are you doing?
s07_e11_c07_u132	Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
s07_e11_c07_u133	So! He'll understand!
s07_e11_c07_u134	No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
s07_e11_c07_u135	God, you are so strong.
s07_e11_c07_u136	Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
s07_e11_c08_u137	(taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!
s07_e11_c08_u138	I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
s07_e11_c08_u139	(entering) Hey!
s07_e11_c08_u140	Hey!
s07_e11_c08_u141	(seeing what they're doing) What do you got there?
s07_e11_c08_u142	Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)
s07_e11_c08_u143	What are you doing tonight?
s07_e11_c08_u144	Huh? Uh- (He starts taking off his pants.)
s07_e11_c08_u145	Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
s07_e11_c08_u146	Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
s07_e11_c08_u147	Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
s07_e11_c08_u148	What?! Tonight?!
s07_e11_c08_u149	That's what Monica said.
s07_e11_c08_u150	After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
s07_e11_c09_u151	Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah.
s07_e11_c09_u152	Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. (To the couple sitting to her right.) Hi!
s07_e11_c09_u153	I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
s07_e11_c09_u154	Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
s07_e11_c09_u155	(To Monica) Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
s07_e11_c09_u156	(to the couple on her left) So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
s07_e11_c09_u157	Okay, you're fine.
s07_e11_c10_u158	Hey!
s07_e11_c10_u159	Hey!
s07_e11_c10_u160	Are you guys ready?
s07_e11_c10_u161	Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
s07_e11_c10_u162	Okay.
s07_e11_c10_u163	Okay.
s07_e11_c10_u164	(To Joey) And for you sir?
s07_e11_c10_u165	Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
s07_e11_c10_u166	It's uh, it's already been roasted.
s07_e11_c10_u167	Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
s07_e11_c10_u168	Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands it to the waiter.)
s07_e11_c10_u169	Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli. (Putting Joey's menu under his arm.)
s07_e11_c10_u170	Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it again. The waiter leaves.) Y'know what Pheebs?
s07_e11_c10_u171	Huh?
s07_e11_c10_u172	You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
s07_e11_c10_u173	(checking her watch) Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
s07_e11_c10_u174	Y'know-y'know what I really want?
s07_e11_c10_u175	What?
s07_e11_c10_u176	Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
s07_e11_c10_u177	(returning) Any progress?
s07_e11_c10_u178	Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
s07_e11_c10_u179	God Joey, this is taking forever!
s07_e11_c10_u180	What's the rush? What?
s07_e11_c10_u181	W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
s07_e11_c10_u182	Whoa-whoa, what is it?
s07_e11_c10_u183	Well- It's a date.
s07_e11_c10_u184	A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
s07_e11_c10_u185	Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
s07_e11_c10_u186	No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
s07_e11_c10_u187	That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
s07_e11_c10_u188	Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
s07_e11_c10_u189	She was?
s07_e11_c10_u190	Well, she graduated from high school!
s07_e11_c10_u191	Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him! (Gets up and leaves.)
s07_e11_c10_u192	Fine!
s07_e11_c10_u193	Yeah!
s07_e11_c10_u194	Fine!
s07_e11_c10_u195	Yeah! (She exits.)
s07_e11_c10_u196	(to the waiter) What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
s07_e11_c11_u197	Hey!
s07_e11_c11_u198	Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
s07_e11_c11_u199	Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
s07_e11_c11_u200	Well, I'm very glad you're here. (Kisses her hand.)
s07_e11_c11_u201	Oh, you're such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! We're going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)
s07_e11_c12_u202	Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
s07_e11_c12_u203	(with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)
s07_e11_c12_u204	I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
s07_e11_c12_u205	Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
s07_e11_c12_u206	Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)
s07_e11_c12_u207	What?! What?!
s07_e11_c12_u208	Oh yes!
s07_e11_c12_u209	Wait a minute!
s07_e11_c12_u210	Oh yes!
s07_e11_c12_u211	Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
s07_e11_c12_u212	Oh yes! Oh yes!
s07_e11_c12_u213	You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
s07_e11_c12_u214	Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
s07_e11_c12_u215	What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
s07_e11_c12_u216	What do we use to split it?
s07_e11_c12_u217	Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.
s07_e11_c12_u218	(examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh- There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured
s07_e11_c12_u219	Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
s07_e11_c12_u220	All right, I'll pick that one. (Points.)
s07_e11_c12_u221	That's also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. (As she's saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!
s07_e11_c12_u222	(gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!
s07_e11_c12_u223	Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
s07_e11_c12_u224	Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my- (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)
s07_e11_c13_u225	Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
s07_e11_c13_u226	Yes, yes it is. It's uh- (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a napkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
s07_e11_c13_u227	Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me? (Starts to get up and great Frannie.)
s07_e11_c13_u228	Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
s07_e11_c13_u229	Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
s07_e11_c13_u230	That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on Frannie's shoulder.)
s07_e11_c13_u231	(turning around) Monica! What
s07_e11_c13_u232	Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
s07_e11_c13_u233	(to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.
s07_e11_c13_u234	You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! (Frannie's husband walks up.) Stuart!
s07_e11_c13_u235	I believe you know my husband.
s07_e11_c13_u236	So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
s07_e11_c14_u237	Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
s07_e11_c14_u238	Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like
s07_e11_c14_u239	July. Umm, (He speaks Russian.)
s07_e11_c14_u240	That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
s07_e11_c14_u241	Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
s07_e11_c14_u242	That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
s07_e11_c14_u243	Yeah, I- Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I-have to leave.
s07_e11_c14_u244	You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
s07_e11_c14_u245	I-I do though.
s07_e11_c14_u246	I do too. (They kiss.)
s07_e11_c14_u247	Bye Phoebe. (He gets in and the cab drives off. Joey walks up and witnesses that event.)
s07_e11_c14_u248	(seeing him) Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
s07_e11_c14_u249	No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I-remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just- Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?
s07_e11_c14_u250	No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never-I may never see him again. (Crying.)
s07_e11_c14_u251	Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
s07_e11_c14_u252	Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
s07_e11_c14_u253	Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
s07_e11_c14_u254	Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)
s07_e11_c14_u255	I can give it a shot.
s07_e11_c15_u256	Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
s07_e11_c15_u257	Stick to your side!
s07_e11_c15_u258	Hey, come on now!
s07_e11_c15_u259	(pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin'? (Starts digging in.)
s07_e11_c16_u260	Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
s07_e11_c16_u261	What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her attention.)
s07_e11_c16_u262	Well
s07_e11_c16_u263	Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monica's wrap and walks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)
s06_e22_c01_u001	(dejected) Hi, you guys.
s06_e22_c01_u002	Hey!
s06_e22_c01_u003	Hi!
s06_e22_c01_u004	What's the matter?
s06_e22_c01_u005	Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
s06_e22_c01_u006	(nodding knowingly) Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
s06_e22_c01_u007	No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
s06_e22_c01_u008	I'll give up my ticket.
s06_e22_c01_u009	Me too.
s06_e22_c01_u010	Okay that's so generous!
s06_e22_c01_u011	And I think Ross is generous too.
s06_e22_c01_u012	Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
s06_e22_c01_u013	Yeah.
s06_e22_c01_u014	So what-what is the exhibit.
s06_e22_c01_u015	It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
s06_e22_c01_u016	Oh man! (Hits Chandler)
s06_e22_c01_u017	(entering) Hey!
s06_e22_c01_u018	Hi!
s06_e22_c01_u019	Hey!
s06_e22_c01_u020	Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
s06_e22_c01_u021	Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
s06_e22_c01_u022	Oh that's great!
s06_e22_c01_u023	Yeah.
s06_e22_c01_u024	I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
s06_e22_c01_u025	Why? What?
s06_e22_c01_u026	Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
s06_e22_c01_u027	No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
s06_e22_c01_u028	I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
s06_e22_c01_u029	Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear.
s06_e22_c01_u030	Ross.
s06_e22_c01_u031	Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, cause-cause y'know, cause he's all old, and
s06_e22_c01_u032	Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
s06_e22_c01_u033	Really? That okay, that's great.
s06_e22_c01_u034	Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
s06_e22_c01_u035	All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
s06_e22_c01_u036	Yes it does.
s06_e22_c01_u037	But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
s06_e22_c01_u038	I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
s06_e22_c01_u039	Ohh! A man with a plan!
s06_e22_c02_u040	Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
s06_e22_c02_u041	I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something- Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll
s06_e22_c02_u042	(gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
s06_e22_c02_u043	Hey! So I'm back.
s06_e22_c02_u044	Who are you?
s06_e22_c02_u045	Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn't remember) Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.) Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
s06_e22_c02_u046	(picking up a TV Guide) Show me in the table.
s06_e22_c02_u047	Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
s06_e22_c02_u048	Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
s06_e22_c02_u049	Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)
s06_e22_c02_u050	So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
s06_e22_c03_u051	Oh, I love museums!
s06_e22_c03_u052	Umm.
s06_e22_c03_u053	Soakin' up all the culture.
s06_e22_c03_u054	Yeah.
s06_e22_c03_u055	Where do you want to start?
s06_e22_c03_u056	Ooh, the gift shop!
s06_e22_c03_u057	Yeah!
s06_e22_c03_u058	Hey, and then lunch.
s06_e22_c03_u059	Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
s06_e22_c03_u060	Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
s06_e22_c03_u061	What?! No! Why?!
s06_e22_c03_u062	No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
s06_e22_c03_u063	(to the couple) You can put the aisle over here (points), and put the wedding ceremony right over here. (Points.)
s06_e22_c03_u064	I didn't know you could get married here.
s06_e22_c03_u065	This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! (Points to both places.) I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.)
s06_e22_c03_u066	(To Monica) May I help you?
s06_e22_c03_u067	Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
s06_e22_c03_u068	Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry! (She kinda storms out with the couple.)
s06_e22_c03_u069	Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
s06_e22_c03_u070	What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
s06_e22_c03_u071	Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)
s06_e22_c03_u072	Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
s06_e22_c03_u073	Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
s06_e22_c03_u074	I'm gonna do it too!
s06_e22_c03_u075	Me too!
s06_e22_c03_u076	Really? Who would, who would you marry?
s06_e22_c03_u077	I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
s06_e22_c03_u078	Oh Pheebs.
s06_e22_c03_u079	Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
s06_e22_c03_u080	Phoebe, that stuff is
s06_e22_c03_u081	Don't even get me started on yours!
s06_e22_c04_u082	(entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
s06_e22_c04_u083	I did.
s06_e22_c04_u084	All right, let's get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)
s06_e22_c04_u085	No! It don't go up on the wall!
s06_e22_c04_u086	What-But you saw the show!
s06_e22_c04_u087	Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
s06_e22_c04_u088	Dry cleaners?
s06_e22_c04_u089	Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
s06_e22_c04_u090	Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
s06_e22_c04_u091	That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
s06_e22_c04_u092	Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
s06_e22_c04_u093	I've never seen it!
s06_e22_c04_u094	Oh you should, it's great.
s06_e22_c05_u095	This place is really beautiful!
s06_e22_c05_u096	Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
s06_e22_c05_u097	Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
s06_e22_c05_u098	Sure!
s06_e22_c05_u099	Are you okay? What's wrong?
s06_e22_c05_u100	Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
s06_e22_c05_u101	Well, whatever works for ya
s06_e22_c05_u102	No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
s06_e22_c05_u103	Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
s06_e22_c05_u104	Yeah.
s06_e22_c05_u105	(quietly) Hey umm, you brought protection right?
s06_e22_c05_u106	(loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
s06_e22_c05_u107	I'll just run to the store and get some.
s06_e22_c05_u108	Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
s06_e22_c05_u109	Do you know where the store is?
s06_e22_c05_u110	No.
s06_e22_c05_u111	Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
s06_e22_c05_u112	A little bit.
s06_e22_c05_u113	(laughs) I'll be back in ten minutes.
s06_e22_c05_u114	Okay.
s06_e22_c05_u115	Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
s06_e22_c05_u116	Ohh, okay.
s06_e22_c05_u117	(from another room) Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
s06_e22_c05_u118	(To Rachel) Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.
s06_e22_c06_u119	(on machine) You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we are.
s06_e22_c06_u120	(on phone) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available- (Chandler runs to answer the phone.)
s06_e22_c06_u121	(on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens) Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!
s06_e22_c07_u122	It's so secluded up here.
s06_e22_c07_u123	I know. I like it up here.
s06_e22_c07_u124	I feel like we're the only two people in the world. (She sets down her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and causes Rachel to scream.)
s06_e22_c07_u125	What's the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
s06_e22_c07_u126	No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?
s06_e22_c07_u127	Honey, we don't have any bears here.
s06_e22_c07_u128	Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
s06_e22_c07_u129	Okay. I'll be right back. (Gets up and heads for the kitchen.)
s06_e22_c07_u130	Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.) What?! What are you doing here?!
s06_e22_c07_u131	What are you doing here?!
s06_e22_c07_u132	I came with Paul!
s06_e22_c07_u133	Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
s06_e22_c07_u134	Get up!
s06_e22_c07_u135	(entering) Here you go honey! (Rachel kicks Ross back under the couch.)
s06_e22_c07_u136	Ahh. Thank you!
s06_e22_c07_u137	Diet Coke. (Hands her the glass.)
s06_e22_c07_u138	Op, ice. I need ice.
s06_e22_c07_u139	Okay.
s06_e22_c07_u140	Thank you.
s06_e22_c07_u141	I'll be right back. (He goes to get the ice.)
s06_e22_c07_u142	(under the couch) You and your ice.
s06_e22_c07_u143	Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the kitchen.) No! Not in there! He's in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the kitchen.)
s06_e22_c07_u144	(before entering) Did you really hear a bear?
s06_e22_c07_u145	Go-go!
s06_e22_c07_u146	(entering) Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
s06_e22_c07_u147	Ohh, thank you.
s06_e22_c07_u148	I'm so happy that you're here.
s06_e22_c07_u149	(entering) Here I am!
s06_e22_c07_u150	(jumping up) Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth's here! Who are you talking to?
s06_e22_c07_u151	Uh, you guys?
s06_e22_c07_u152	How did you know we were here?
s06_e22_c07_u153	Umm
s06_e22_c07_u154	Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
s06_e22_c07_u155	Obviously.
s06_e22_c07_u156	Elizabeth, what are you doing here?! (Motions that he brought Rachel here to be alone with her.)
s06_e22_c07_u157	Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
s06_e22_c07_u158	Yeah! Yep.
s06_e22_c07_u159	Well, why do y'know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in) and do your homework?
s06_e22_c07_u160	Ohh, I wouldn't do it in there. That's my dad's bedroom.
s06_e22_c07_u161	That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. (Yelling) That's your dad's bedroom!
s06_e22_c07_u162	Why are you yelling?
s06_e22_c07_u163	Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
s06_e22_c08_u164	Hi, honey.
s06_e22_c08_u165	(gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)
s06_e22_c08_u166	What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
s06_e22_c08_u167	(angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He storms out.)
s06_e22_c08_u168	(on machine) Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.
s06_e22_c08_u169	Oh no!
s06_e22_c08_u170	(on machine) I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
s06_e22_c08_u171	Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!
s06_e22_c08_u172	(on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.)
s06_e22_c08_u173	NOOOO!!!!!!!!
s06_e22_c09_u174	Can I help you?
s06_e22_c09_u175	Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?
s06_e22_c09_u176	He's not here right now.
s06_e22_c09_u177	Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
s06_e22_c09_u178	Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there. (She makes eyes at him.)
s06_e22_c09_u179	Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) You're the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)
s06_e22_c10_u180	So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
s06_e22_c10_u181	Oh no-no believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible!
s06_e22_c10_u182	Good. Good. Not that we don't want you to stay, obviously you're welcome-How much more homework do you have?
s06_e22_c10_u183	Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
s06_e22_c10_u184	Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me something from the car.
s06_e22_c10_u185	What do you need from the car?
s06_e22_c10_u186	Surprise me.
s06_e22_c10_u187	(whispering) Okay. (Starts for the car.)
s06_e22_c10_u188	(yelling) So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!
s06_e22_c10_u189	(standing in front of a mirror and to himself) Just relax. Just relax Paul, you're doing great. (Ross moves a piece of luggage over so he can watch Paul.) She likes you. She- Maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Y'know why? Because you're a (pause) neat guy. (Ross can't believe what he's hearing.) You are the man. You are (pause) the man! (He opens his shirt and looks at his chest.) I still got it. Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. (Starts singing) I'm just a love machine and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey bab-y! (Flexes and grunts loudly.) Showtime. (Starts to leave and starts singing.) I'm just a love machine, yeah ba-by! (Grunts again and Ross is stunned.)
s06_e22_c11_u190	Phoebe!
s06_e22_c11_u191	Yeah?
s06_e22_c11_u192	Have you seen Chandler?!
s06_e22_c11_u193	No! Why?
s06_e22_c11_u194	The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad is this?!
s06_e22_c11_u195	Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
s06_e22_c11_u196	I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
s06_e22_c11_u197	What are you gonna do?
s06_e22_c11_u198	Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! (Mimicking her.) "Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
s06_e22_c11_u199	Rachel said that!
s06_e22_c11_u200	Well Rachel's not here! (Runs out.)
s06_e22_c12_u201	Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)
s06_e22_c12_u202	I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
s06_e22_c12_u203	(entering) Son of a bitch!
s06_e22_c12_u204	Okay, maybe ask this guy.
s06_e22_c12_u205	You, get out of my shop!
s06_e22_c12_u206	Well, what did he do?
s06_e22_c12_u207	He went out with my wife!
s06_e22_c12_u208	Joey!
s06_e22_c12_u209	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! (The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)
s06_e22_c12_u210	That's my wife!!! Get out! (Starts yelling at him in Russian, and I'm betting he's not saying pleasant things about him.)
s06_e22_c12_u211	Well, we should go.
s06_e22_c12_u212	Yeah.
s06_e22_c13_u213	Ross? Ross?
s06_e22_c13_u214	Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I'm gonna go out this window. (Points to the window next to him.) I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?
s06_e22_c13_u215	Okay!
s06_e22_c13_u216	(yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
s06_e22_c13_u217	Ross!
s06_e22_c13_u218	Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
s06_e22_c13_u219	(to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
s06_e22_c13_u220	Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
s06_e22_c13_u221	Daddy!
s06_e22_c13_u222	You're next!!
s06_e22_c13_u223	Okay. I didn't know he was here. (Runs over to Rachel.)
s06_e22_c13_u224	Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
s06_e22_c13_u225	Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain
s06_e22_c13_u226	No, let me explain! Fired!!
s06_e22_c13_u227	All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)
s06_e22_c13_u228	(panicked) What?
s06_e22_c13_u229	And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics Paul's flexing.)
s06_e22_c13_u230	Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
s06_e22_c14_u231	(going over to him) I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
s06_e22_c14_u232	I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)
s06_e22_c14_u233	Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
s06_e22_c14_u234	Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
s06_e22_c14_u235	Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
s06_e22_c14_u236	Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
s06_e22_c14_u237	It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
s06_e22_c14_u238	Okay.
s06_e22_c14_u239	Really?
s06_e22_c14_u240	Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready
s06_e22_c14_u241	I know! I know.
s06_e22_c14_u242	Okay. (They hug.)
s06_e22_c14_u243	I'm gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you're back. I was really worried about you. (Exits.)
s06_e22_c14_u244	(entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?
s06_e22_c14_u245	Totally.
s06_e22_c14_u246	So did Heldi show you the place?
s06_e22_c14_u247	Yeah, it's beautiful.
s06_e22_c14_u248	I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
s06_e22_c14_u249	I know.
s06_e22_c15_u250	Hey Gunther.
s06_e22_c15_u251	Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there (points) wants the biscotti.
s06_e22_c15_u252	Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
s06_e22_c15_u253	Do you still work here?
s06_e22_c15_u254	No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
s06_e22_c15_u255	Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
s06_e22_c15_u256	Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)
s04_e05_c01_u001	(picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face. Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)
s04_e05_c01_u002	Thank you.
s04_e05_c02_u003	Rachel?
s04_e05_c02_u004	Yeah?
s04_e05_c02_u005	When's your birthday?
s04_e05_c02_u006	May fifth, why?
s04_e05_c02_u007	Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
s04_e05_c02_u008	Oh, mine's December...
s04_e05_c02_u009	Yeah, whatever. (Walks away)
s04_e05_c02_u010	Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
s04_e05_c02_u011	Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
s04_e05_c02_u012	I could die.
s04_e05_c02_u013	Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
s04_e05_c02_u014	Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
s04_e05_c02_u015	I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
s04_e05_c02_u016	(entering) Oh.
s04_e05_c02_u017	Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)
s04_e05_c02_u018	Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
s04_e05_c02_u019	(in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table, and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)
s04_e05_c02_u020	All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
s04_e05_c02_u021	Just be yourself. But, not too much.
s04_e05_c02_u022	(gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.
s04_e05_c02_u023	(loudly) Good luck!
s04_e05_c02_u024	Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
s04_e05_c02_u025	No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
s04_e05_c02_u026	Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
s04_e05_c02_u027	With a K.
s04_e05_c02_u028	Oh-oh-hey!
s04_e05_c02_u029	Wow! You are really good at this.
s04_e05_c02_u030	Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
s04_e05_c02_u031	I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. (Joey enters) Oh, and there he is now.
s04_e05_c02_u032	Hey!
s04_e05_c02_u033	Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)
s04_e05_c02_u034	Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
s04_e05_c02_u035	Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
s04_e05_c02_u036	Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
s04_e05_c02_u037	Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. (Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stops singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing) Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
s04_e05_c03_u038	(sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!
s04_e05_c03_u039	Hi.
s04_e05_c03_u040	Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
s04_e05_c03_u041	I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
s04_e05_c03_u042	Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
s04_e05_c03_u043	You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
s04_e05_c03_u044	Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
s04_e05_c03_u045	Oh please!
s04_e05_c03_u046	So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
s04_e05_c03_u047	Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
s04_e05_c03_u048	That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
s04_e05_c03_u049	(laughs) Oh-oh-oh-oh!
s04_e05_c03_u050	Is it on?
s04_e05_c03_u051	No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
s04_e05_c03_u052	Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)
s04_e05_c03_u053	Oh my God!
s04_e05_c03_u054	Oh! It's on! It's on!
s04_e05_c03_u055	There we go little fella.
s04_e05_c03_u056	(laughs) What about the duck?
s04_e05_c03_u057	Well the duck can swim.
s04_e05_c03_u058	Oh, jeez. (Hits him)
s04_e05_c04_u059	(singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
s04_e05_c04_u060	Way to go, Phoebe!
s04_e05_c04_u061	That cold makes you sound so great.
s04_e05_c04_u062	It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)
s04_e05_c04_u063	Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
s04_e05_c04_u064	Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
s04_e05_c04_u065	No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
s04_e05_c04_u066	Well, have fun!
s04_e05_c04_u067	Okay.
s04_e05_c04_u068	Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
s04_e05_c04_u069	Y'know what, I like Kathy.
s04_e05_c04_u070	Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
s04_e05_c04_u071	Yeah, she's...
s04_e05_c04_u072	She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
s04_e05_c04_u073	You love her.
s04_e05_c04_u074	No, I don't.
s04_e05_c04_u075	Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
s04_e05_c04_u076	Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
s04_e05_c04_u077	Thank you, Ross.
s04_e05_c04_u078	Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
s04_e05_c04_u079	All right.
s04_e05_c04_u080	Ohh!
s04_e05_c04_u081	All right.
s04_e05_c04_u082	(turning around and doing that, "I'm making out with someone," thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)
s04_e05_c05_u083	So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
s04_e05_c05_u084	Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
s04_e05_c05_u085	Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
s04_e05_c05_u086	(entering) Hey!
s04_e05_c05_u087	Hey!
s04_e05_c05_u088	Hey.
s04_e05_c05_u089	(loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
s04_e05_c05_u090	Rachel's not here.
s04_e05_c05_u091	Oh.
s04_e05_c05_u092	How's it going with her?
s04_e05_c05_u093	Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
s04_e05_c05_u094	(entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
s04_e05_c05_u095	Hi, Josh.
s04_e05_c05_u096	Hi.
s04_e05_c05_u097	Dudes.
s04_e05_c05_u098	So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)
s04_e05_c05_u099	Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
s04_e05_c05_u100	Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
s04_e05_c05_u101	Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
s04_e05_c05_u102	Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.
s04_e05_c05_u103	Dope! (exits)
s04_e05_c05_u104	Wow, cute one!
s04_e05_c05_u105	Very!
s04_e05_c05_u106	I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
s04_e05_c05_u107	Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
s04_e05_c05_u108	Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
s04_e05_c05_u109	Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)
s04_e05_c05_u110	What was that?
s04_e05_c05_u111	Monica knows.
s04_e05_c05_u112	It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
s04_e05_c05_u113	Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
s04_e05_c05_u114	Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to sing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
s04_e05_c06_u115	(opening the door) Hi!
s04_e05_c06_u116	Hi!
s04_e05_c06_u117	Hi Ben!
s04_e05_c06_u118	Wow! You-you look great!
s04_e05_c06_u119	Thanks!
s04_e05_c06_u120	(she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.
s04_e05_c06_u121	I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
s04_e05_c06_u122	Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
s04_e05_c06_u123	Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
s04_e05_c06_u124	What?
s04_e05_c06_u125	I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
s04_e05_c06_u126	I-I-I...
s04_e05_c06_u127	(noticing the bottle of wine he has) Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime. (She leaves)
s04_e05_c06_u128	Who wants to make some long distance calls?
s04_e05_c07_u129	Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.
s04_e05_c07_u130	Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
s04_e05_c07_u131	Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
s04_e05_c07_u132	Hey!
s04_e05_c07_u133	Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)
s04_e05_c08_u134	Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
s04_e05_c08_u135	Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)
s04_e05_c08_u136	Pheebs, what are you doing?
s04_e05_c08_u137	Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
s04_e05_c08_u138	Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
s04_e05_c08_u139	(entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
s04_e05_c08_u140	What?!
s04_e05_c08_u141	Are you serious?
s04_e05_c08_u142	Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
s04_e05_c08_u143	I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
s04_e05_c08_u144	(sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
s04_e05_c08_u145	You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
s04_e05_c08_u146	Hey.
s04_e05_c08_u147	(to Chandler) We were just talking about you.
s04_e05_c08_u148	Really?!
s04_e05_c08_u149	Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
s04_e05_c08_u150	(laughs) Right in there!
s04_e05_c09_u151	99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
s04_e05_c09_u152	(entering) Hey!
s04_e05_c09_u153	Hey!
s04_e05_c09_u154	Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
s04_e05_c09_u155	Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
s04_e05_c09_u156	It's 4:30.
s04_e05_c09_u157	Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
s04_e05_c09_u158	Okay, I see what's going on here.
s04_e05_c09_u159	You-you do?
s04_e05_c09_u160	Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
s04_e05_c09_u161	You got me.
s04_e05_c09_u162	Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
s04_e05_c09_u163	Yeah. Right.
s04_e05_c09_u164	Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
s04_e05_c09_u165	Okay.
s04_e05_c10_u166	(lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.
s04_e05_c10_u167	Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!
s04_e05_c10_u168	So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
s04_e05_c10_u169	Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!
s04_e05_c10_u170	What?
s04_e05_c10_u171	I think he's stealing from me.
s04_e05_c10_u172	Why?
s04_e05_c10_u173	Because he's stealing from me!
s04_e05_c10_u174	(entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
s04_e05_c10_u175	Ughh! (Storms out after him)
s04_e05_c10_u176	(to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
s04_e05_c10_u177	Thank you so much Phoebe.
s04_e05_c10_u178	(picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.
s04_e05_c10_u179	What are you doing with those?!
s04_e05_c10_u180	But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
s04_e05_c10_u181	Sorry, Phoebe.
s04_e05_c10_u182	It's okay. How's the soup?
s04_e05_c10_u183	Umm. (nodding her head, "Good.")
s04_e05_c10_u184	Ohhhh!! Gross!!
s04_e05_c11_u185	Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
s04_e05_c11_u186	Is she great or what?
s04_e05_c11_u187	(to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?
s04_e05_c11_u188	Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
s04_e05_c11_u189	Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
s04_e05_c11_u190	Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
s04_e05_c11_u191	Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
s04_e05_c11_u192	Uhh, no-no thanks.
s04_e05_c11_u193	Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
s04_e05_c11_u194	Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)
s04_e05_c11_u195	(to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?
s04_e05_c11_u196	What?
s04_e05_c11_u197	Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
s04_e05_c11_u198	Hey, look, what do you want from me?
s04_e05_c11_u199	I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
s04_e05_c11_u200	I am pretending.
s04_e05_c11_u201	Well then, do it better!
s04_e05_c11_u202	Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
s04_e05_c11_u203	Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
s04_e05_c12_u204	(entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
s04_e05_c12_u205	No, sorry.
s04_e05_c12_u206	Well where's Amanda?
s04_e05_c12_u207	Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
s04_e05_c12_u208	I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
s04_e05_c12_u209	Ross, cough drops, please?
s04_e05_c12_u210	At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
s04_e05_c12_u211	Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
s04_e05_c12_u212	You see Amanda and I have a very special...
s04_e05_c12_u213	(interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
s04_e05_c12_u214	(laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.
s04_e05_c12_u215	And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
s04_e05_c12_u216	Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! (Shows her, her ring)
s04_e05_c12_u217	That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
s04_e05_c12_u218	Fine.
s04_e05_c12_u219	Sorry.
s04_e05_c12_u220	Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
s04_e05_c12_u221	Y'know...
s04_e05_c13_u222	(singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work without my sexy voice?
s04_e05_c13_u223	I like it. (sneezes)
s04_e05_c13_u224	Gunther, kiss me.
s04_e05_c13_u225	What?
s04_e05_c14_u226	(opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
s04_e05_c15_u227	Can I sleep on your couch?
s04_e05_c16_u228	(singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
s04_e05_c16_u229	Rachel?
s04_e05_c16_u230	Yeah.
s04_e05_c16_u231	I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
s04_e05_c16_u232	No!
s04_e05_c16_u233	Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
s04_e05_c16_u234	(confused) Okay.
s04_e05_c16_u235	So umm, are we cool?
s04_e05_c16_u236	(really confused) Okay.
s04_e05_c16_u237	I knew you'd understand.
s10_e07_c01_u001	Hey!
s04_e16_c01_u001	What is it hon?
s04_e16_c01_u002	I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! (Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.
s04_e16_c01_u003	Aww, honey I'm sorry.
s04_e16_c01_u004	God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh! (She goes to the bathroom.)
s04_e16_c01_u005	Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
s04_e16_c01_u006	Yeah?
s04_e16_c01_u007	It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
s04_e16_c01_u008	Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
s04_e16_c01_u009	(she smells his head) No!
s04_e16_c01_u010	Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?
s04_e16_c01_u011	Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
s04_e16_c01_u012	Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it's a pickle?!
s04_e16_c02_u013	What are you writing?
s04_e16_c02_u014	Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
s04_e16_c02_u015	Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style-what did you throw away?
s04_e16_c02_u016	Hi guys!
s04_e16_c02_u017	Hey!
s04_e16_c02_u018	Hey, what have you guys been up too?
s04_e16_c02_u019	Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
s04_e16_c02_u020	Without me?!
s04_e16_c02_u021	My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
s04_e16_c02_u022	Yeah.
s04_e16_c02_u023	They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! (Shows them a doorknob she has.)
s04_e16_c02_u024	I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
s04_e16_c02_u025	I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. (Chandler is shocked.) It's a joke. (They all laugh.)
s04_e16_c02_u026	Bye. (They kiss.)
s04_e16_c02_u027	Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then. (She leaves.)
s04_e16_c02_u028	Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
s04_e16_c02_u029	Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
s04_e16_c02_u030	Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
s04_e16_c02_u031	Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
s04_e16_c02_u032	Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
s04_e16_c02_u033	Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
s04_e16_c02_u034	Pheebs!
s04_e16_c02_u035	Hey!
s04_e16_c02_u036	(starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!
s04_e16_c02_u037	(angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
s04_e16_c02_u038	Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
s04_e16_c02_u039	Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
s04_e16_c02_u040	Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
s04_e16_c02_u041	That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
s04_e16_c03_u042	(coming in from a changing room) Okay!
s04_e16_c03_u043	Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
s04_e16_c03_u044	Oh great! (He tries on the coat.) Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
s04_e16_c03_u045	Yeah?
s04_e16_c03_u046	Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. (He goes to put his hands in his pockets.)
s04_e16_c03_u047	(stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
s04_e16_c03_u048	Why not?!
s04_e16_c03_u049	Well, that's because of a lot of-(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)
s04_e16_c03_u050	Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
s04_e16_c03_u051	I know!
s04_e16_c03_u052	Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
s04_e16_c03_u053	Oh?
s04_e16_c03_u054	Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
s04_e16_c03_u055	Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
s04_e16_c03_u056	No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
s04_e16_c03_u057	Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting. (She goes over and retrieves her note.)
s04_e16_c03_u058	(noticing her) Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
s04_e16_c03_u059	Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
s04_e16_c03_u060	Then uh, what's-what's this? (Shows her the real anti-theft device.)
s04_e16_c03_u061	You need that, you need that too cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)
s04_e16_c04_u062	Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
s04_e16_c04_u063	What are you talking about?
s04_e16_c04_u064	Yeah, what' going on?
s04_e16_c04_u065	We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)
s04_e16_c04_u066	Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
s04_e16_c04_u067	Awwww!
s04_e16_c04_u068	(entering) Hello?
s04_e16_c04_u069	Surprise!!!
s04_e16_c04_u070	No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
s04_e16_c04_u071	Well, it was all Ross's idea.
s04_e16_c04_u072	You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
s04_e16_c04_u073	You really didn't know?
s04_e16_c04_u074	Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)
s04_e16_c04_u075	Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
s04_e16_c04_u076	Like what?
s04_e16_c04_u077	What-what-what is so funny?
s04_e16_c04_u078	I said, "Like what?"
s04_e16_c04_u079	Now that's a thinker.
s04_e16_c04_u080	Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!
s04_e16_c04_u081	Hi!
s04_e16_c04_u082	Care for a cherry?
s04_e16_c04_u083	Oh, no thanks.
s04_e16_c04_u084	No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
s04_e16_c04_u085	You okay? (Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)
s04_e16_c04_u086	(interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.
s04_e16_c04_u087	Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
s04_e16_c04_u088	Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
s04_e16_c04_u089	So why did you plan a party at the same time?
s04_e16_c04_u090	No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
s04_e16_c04_u091	But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
s04_e16_c04_u092	Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica's knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)
s04_e16_c04_u093	Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
s04_e16_c04_u094	A little salami.
s04_e16_c04_u095	Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
s04_e16_c04_u096	Pastrami.
s04_e16_c04_u097	Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
s04_e16_c04_u098	Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
s04_e16_c04_u099	Yeah. (He goes over to her.)
s04_e16_c04_u100	Up!
s04_e16_c04_u101	You changed?
s04_e16_c04_u102	Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
s04_e16_c04_u103	And lucky means, more cleavage?
s04_e16_c04_u104	Does for me.
s04_e16_c04_u105	Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
s04_e16_c04_u106	Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
s04_e16_c04_u107	What?
s04_e16_c04_u108	There was a seen in Footloose...
s04_e16_c04_u109	Flashdance.
s04_e16_c04_u110	Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl
s04_e16_c04_u111	She was a welder.
s04_e16_c04_u112	What? Were you like in the movie, or- Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
s04_e16_c04_u113	Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
s04_e16_c04_u114	It's not Christmas!
s04_e16_c04_u115	Or Spin the Bottle?
s04_e16_c04_u116	He's not 11!
s04_e16_c04_u117	(with her coat on, she's leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
s04_e16_c04_u118	What? You're leaving?!
s04_e16_c04_u119	Yes, we have something we have to get to.
s04_e16_c04_u120	Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
s04_e16_c04_u121	No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
s04_e16_c04_u122	What big thing?
s04_e16_c04_u123	(spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?
s04_e16_c04_u124	I'll go.
s04_e16_c04_u125	Yay!
s04_e16_c04_u126	Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)
s04_e16_c04_u127	Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now! (They kiss again.)
s04_e16_c04_u128	Yay! Emily!
s04_e16_c04_u129	What are the odds? What are the odds?
s04_e16_c04_u130	(stopping them) Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
s04_e16_c04_u131	If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
s04_e16_c04_u132	Okay, my turn!!
s04_e16_c04_u133	Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
s04_e16_c04_u134	Ohh!
s04_e16_c04_u135	It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
s04_e16_c04_u136	Oh my God!
s04_e16_c04_u137	All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
s04_e16_c04_u138	Just a bug.
s04_e16_c05_u139	Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
s04_e16_c05_u140	Okay.
s04_e16_c05_u141	There's a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)
s04_e16_c05_u142	Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
s04_e16_c05_u143	I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
s04_e16_c05_u144	All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
s04_e16_c05_u145	Yeah, totally!
s04_e16_c05_u146	All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!
s04_e16_c05_u147	Feel better now?
s04_e16_c05_u148	Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
s04_e16_c05_u149	Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
s04_e16_c05_u150	What?
s04_e16_c05_u151	Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
s04_e16_c05_u152	Yeah.
s04_e16_c05_u153	Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
s04_e16_c05_u154	Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
s04_e16_c05_u155	Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
s04_e16_c05_u156	Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
s04_e16_c05_u157	But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
s04_e16_c05_u158	Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
s04_e16_c05_u159	No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
s04_e16_c05_u160	Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-(pause), actually I kinda want to see what happens.
s04_e16_c05_u161	Hey!
s04_e16_c05_u162	Hi!
s04_e16_c05_u163	Nice uh, costume.
s04_e16_c05_u164	Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an E!'
s04_e16_c05_u165	E!
s04_e16_c05_u166	Gimme an M!'
s04_e16_c05_u167	M!
s04_e16_c05_u168	Gimme an I!'
s04_e16_c05_u169	I!
s04_e16_c05_u170	Gimme an L!'
s04_e16_c05_u171	L!
s04_e16_c05_u172	Gimme a Y!'
s04_e16_c05_u173	Y!
s04_e16_c05_u174	What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil-Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler's room.) Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther's the only one that claps.)
s04_e16_c05_u175	I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?
s04_e16_c05_u176	I think you're done.
s04_e16_c05_u177	Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)
s04_e16_c05_u178	Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
s04_e16_c05_u179	(trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.
s04_e16_c05_u180	All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
s04_e16_c05_u181	Okay.
s04_e16_c05_u182	Rachel is my girlfriend.
s04_e16_c05_u183	So, this was uh, really fun.
s04_e16_c05_u184	Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y'know, this bra- Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn't co-operating.)
s04_e16_c05_u185	Need uh, need a little hand there.
s04_e16_c05_u186	Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
s04_e16_c05_u187	You really don't seem like you do. That's
s04_e16_c05_u188	Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
s04_e16_c05_u189	Well, what was supposed to happen?
s04_e16_c05_u190	Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
s04_e16_c05_u191	Huh. Oh, boy! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
s04_e16_c05_u192	Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
s04_e16_c05_u193	No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
s04_e16_c05_u194	Why?!
s04_e16_c05_u195	Because I-I like you.
s04_e16_c05_u196	You like me?
s04_e16_c05_u197	Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
s04_e16_c05_u198	Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
s04_e16_c05_u199	But
s04_e16_c05_u200	Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
s04_e16_c05_u201	Okay uh, however
s04_e16_c05_u202	Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
s04_e16_c05_u203	My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
s04_e16_c05_u204	But-.
s04_e16_c05_u205	I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
s04_e16_c05_u206	Okay.
s04_e16_c06_u207	Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
s04_e16_c06_u208	That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
s04_e16_c06_u209	Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
s04_e16_c06_u210	Yeah.
s04_e16_c06_u211	Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
s04_e16_c06_u212	Helps a little.
s04_e16_c06_u213	Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
s04_e16_c06_u214	Yeah, have a seat.
s04_e16_c06_u215	I'm so sorry.
s04_e16_c06_u216	That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
s04_e16_c06_u217	Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
s04_e16_c06_u218	What do you mean?
s04_e16_c06_u219	You seem to really like her.
s04_e16_c06_u220	Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
s04_e16_c06_u221	Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
s04_e16_c06_u222	You think?
s04_e16_c06_u223	Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
s04_e16_c06_u224	Hey, you're right.
s04_e16_c06_u225	Yeah.
s04_e16_c06_u226	Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?
s04_e16_c06_u227	I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
s04_e16_c06_u228	Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach! (He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)
s04_e16_c06_u229	Hey.
s04_e16_c06_u230	Hey.
s04_e16_c06_u231	You're a pathetic loser, right?
s04_e16_c06_u232	Oh-ho, yeah!
s04_e16_c06_u233	Sit!
s04_e16_c06_u234	Hi. (He has just returned.)
s04_e16_c06_u235	Oh my gosh, Joshua!
s04_e16_c06_u236	All those things I said about not being ready
s04_e16_c06_u237	They're not true?
s04_e16_c06_u238	No, they're-they're all true.
s04_e16_c06_u239	Oh.
s04_e16_c06_u240	But
s04_e16_c06_u241	Oh! Oh, I love that but.
s04_e16_c06_u242	You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
s04_e16_c06_u243	Yeah.
s04_e16_c06_u244	Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.
s04_e16_c07_u245	Oooh, what you got there?
s04_e16_c07_u246	Pastrami.
s04_e16_c07_u247	Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
s04_e16_c07_u248	Hm-mm, corn beef.
s04_e16_c07_u249	Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
s04_e16_c07_u250	Okay.
s04_e16_c07_u251	(He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
s04_e16_c07_u252	Six months.
s04_e16_c07_u253	Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
s04_e16_c07_u254	Not if I get there first.
s09_e04_c02_u001	hey Joey
s09_e04_c02_u002	Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you (looks at the woman) but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.
s09_e04_c02_u003	yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend
s09_e04_c02_u004	he has to work, there's some rush on the big (pause, thinks) ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.
s09_e04_c02_u005	maybe I will go (thinks) yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.
s09_e04_c02_u006	how do you know I have one of those?
s09_e04_c06_u007	is everything all right?
s09_e04_c06_u008	I'm gonna go freshen up ok
s09_e04_c06_u009	Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
s09_e04_c06_u010	yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
s09_e04_c06_u011	Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
s09_e04_c07_u012	do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
s09_e04_c07_u013	what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
s09_e04_c07_u014	Eww are you talking about my bother.
s09_e04_c07_u015	But you don't remember sleeping with her.
s09_e04_c07_u016	what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night
s09_e04_c07_u017	Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
s09_e04_c07_u018	Joey, Joey.
s09_e04_c07_u019	you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
s09_e04_c11_u020	Hi, how was your flight? (She hugs him)
s09_e04_c11_u021	Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. (Monica shows him the tape then puts it in) have a little surprise for you.
s09_e04_c11_u022	Ok (sits down next to him) This is how much I love you. (She presses play then puts her arm around Chandler's neck.)
s09_e04_c11_u023	Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
s09_e04_c11_u024	Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
s09_e04_c11_u025	Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
s09_e04_c11_u026	sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
s09_e04_c11_u027	I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
s09_e04_c11_u028	then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
s09_e04_c11_u029	really?
s09_e04_c11_u030	I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! (They hug)
s09_e04_c11_u031	Im very, very drunk right now.
s09_e07_c01_u001	And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. (baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got... (in a softer voice) You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the B's) Big baby butt! I like big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get...(Emma laughs) Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...(raps) My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon... (Emma laughs again and Ross looks worried) I'm a terrible father!
s09_e07_c02_u002	Hi!
s09_e07_c02_u003	Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
s09_e07_c02_u004	How come?
s09_e07_c02_u005	Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
s09_e07_c02_u006	What do you do with your money now?
s09_e07_c02_u007	Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. (realises that anyone could have overheard that) I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
s09_e07_c02_u008	Do you have any ideas?
s09_e07_c02_u009	Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
s09_e07_c02_u010	Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
s09_e07_c02_u011	(laughs) Yeah! Right! (points at Monica) People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird." (laughs again) Or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...)
s09_e07_c02_u012	Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. (looks at Chandler) That's right, I know some stuff!
s09_e07_c02_u013	Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
s09_e07_c02_u014	(very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
s09_e07_c02_u015	(imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
s09_e07_c02_u016	My dad told me. They play golf together.
s09_e07_c02_u017	Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
s09_e07_c03_u018	Hi!
s09_e07_c03_u019	Hey!
s09_e07_c03_u020	Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight! (Rachel gasps)
s09_e07_c03_u021	Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
s09_e07_c03_u022	(sarcastically) Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
s09_e07_c03_u023	They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
s09_e07_c03_u024	They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
s09_e07_c03_u025	Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
s09_e07_c03_u026	Okay, so... allright... Which dress? (she holds up two 'Phoebe' dresses, Rachel and Monica look at them... taking their time, don't wanting to hurt Phoebe) You can say "neither".
s09_e07_c03_u027	Oh God, neither!
s09_e07_c03_u028	I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
s09_e07_c03_u029	Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."
s09_e07_c03_u030	You went out with Wallis Pincer?
s09_e07_c03_u031	Uh, he took the SAT's for me.
s09_e07_c03_u032	I knew you didn't get a 1400!
s09_e07_c03_u033	Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
s09_e07_c03_u034	So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
s09_e07_c03_u035	Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
s09_e07_c03_u036	(speaking louder and articulating) That's she's like the daughter she never had. (Phoebe points at her ears) Listen! (Monica looks at Phoebe in a duh! way)
s09_e07_c04_u037	Hi.
s09_e07_c04_u038	Hi.
s09_e07_c04_u039	I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!
s09_e07_c04_u040	Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
s09_e07_c04_u041	(in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
s09_e07_c04_u042	Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... (Ross tries to impersonate Emma's laugh, but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched. He laughs about himself but then looks at Rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) Only... only not creepy.
s09_e07_c04_u043	Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)
s09_e07_c04_u044	I uhm... Well, I sang... (Rachel gasps) well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back... (Rachel's face changes from excited to angry)
s09_e07_c04_u045	You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
s09_e07_c04_u046	But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
s09_e07_c04_u047	(disgusted) owwwww...
s09_e07_c04_u048	Please don't take her away from me!
s09_e07_c05_u049	Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
s09_e07_c05_u050	Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
s09_e07_c05_u051	So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
s09_e07_c05_u052	Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....
s09_e07_c05_u053	mmm That's enough about you!
s09_e07_c05_u054	Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
s09_e07_c05_u055	All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here... (Joey and Chandler both realise what she's assuming and start laughing.)
s09_e07_c05_u056	No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
s09_e07_c05_u057	Oh... Okay, sorry!
s09_e07_c05_u058	Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
s09_e07_c05_u059	We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey looks around)
s09_e07_c05_u060	You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... (Joey sits down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) Yeah, I could see it.
s09_e07_c05_u061	(Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by Richard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
s09_e07_c05_u062	What?
s09_e07_c05_u063	There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
s09_e07_c05_u064	Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... (realises) Wait a minute... This says Monica... (looks around) And this is Richard's apartment... (realises some more)
s09_e07_c05_u065	Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)
s09_e07_c06_u066	Wow! You look like... like my mom.
s09_e07_c06_u067	I'm wearing pantyhose!
s09_e07_c06_u068	Great! Come on in! (Mike kisses her on the cheek. A butler walks in and takes Phoebe's coat.)
s09_e07_c06_u069	Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
s09_e07_c06_u070	No, my parents are rich.
s09_e07_c06_u071	Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. (Mike's parents walk in) HELLO!
s09_e07_c06_u072	Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.
s09_e07_c06_u073	(in a very posh accent) Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
s09_e07_c06_u074	It's so nice to finally meet you!
s09_e07_c06_u075	And you... Your home is lovely.
s09_e07_c06_u076	Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually three floors.
s09_e07_c06_u077	Holy crap!
s09_e07_c06_u078	Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?
s09_e07_c06_u079	Oh, try and stop me!
s09_e07_c06_u080	Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
s09_e07_c06_u081	(no accent) I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
s09_e07_c06_u082	Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not (accent) Phoebe...
s09_e07_c06_u083	(accent) Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
s09_e07_c06_u084	Well, come on...
s09_e07_c06_u085	Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
s09_e07_c06_u086	Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... So where are you from?
s09_e07_c06_u087	(no accent) Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit surreal, which Phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) So... where does everyone summer?
s09_e07_c07_u088	God! God! This is not going well.
s09_e07_c07_u089	No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you go talk to my dad?
s09_e07_c07_u090	Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?
s09_e07_c07_u091	Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
s09_e07_c07_u092	So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
s09_e07_c07_u093	Oh... Well...
s09_e07_c07_u094	Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
s09_e07_c07_u095	Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...
s09_e07_c07_u096	Yeah I bet! Look out! (Phoebe punches Theodore right in the stomach)
s09_e07_c07_u097	OH! OWWWWW! (Theodore grabs his stomach in agony)
s09_e07_c07_u098	Oh my God, are you okay?
s09_e07_c07_u099	I recently had surgery.
s09_e07_c07_u100	I'm so sorry!
s09_e07_c07_u101	No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
s09_e07_c07_u102	I really, really am sorry.
s09_e07_c07_u103	How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach? (Theodore walks out... Mike walks towards Phoebe)
s09_e07_c07_u104	Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?
s09_e07_c07_u105	Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...
s09_e07_c07_u106	But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don't you go talk to my mom?
s09_e07_c07_u107	Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.
s09_e07_c07_u108	Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding. (Mike walks away and Bitsy walks in the same direction.)
s09_e07_c07_u109	Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
s09_e07_c07_u110	Well, not at all...
s09_e07_c07_u111	Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
s09_e07_c07_u112	Thank you, I think so too.
s09_e07_c07_u113	Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
s09_e07_c07_u114	Is he really?
s09_e07_c07_u115	Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
s09_e07_c07_u116	E-e-excuse me?
s09_e07_c07_u117	(Mike now enters and stands behind Phoebe) Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
s09_e07_c07_u118	That's... my boy. (Bitsy walks away)
s09_e07_c07_u119	Awesome!
s09_e07_c08_u120	I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well, we know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey enters the apartment)
s09_e07_c08_u121	Hey dude, what's up?
s09_e07_c08_u122	Don't judge me, I'm only human!
s09_e07_c08_u123	Did you take that tape?
s09_e07_c08_u124	I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
s09_e07_c08_u125	I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
s09_e07_c08_u126	Some girl...!?
s09_e07_c08_u127	She hot?
s09_e07_c08_u128	Yeah...!?
s09_e07_c08_u129	How did she get me to settle down?
s09_e07_c08_u130	Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?
s09_e07_c08_u131	Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
s09_e07_c08_u132	Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
s09_e07_c08_u133	(backs off) What? Whoo... What?
s09_e07_c08_u134	Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?
s09_e07_c08_u135	All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame... (Chandler turns his back to the TV. Joey puts the tape in the VCR, switches it on and watches what's on the tape... It's clearly a american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)
s09_e07_c08_u136	Why am I hearing cheering?
s09_e07_c08_u137	Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
s09_e07_c08_u138	Football? Just football?
s09_e07_c08_u139	Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
s09_e07_c08_u140	It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... (Chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the TV and a moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) What the... (Chandler turns around, but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler, jumps, and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) What are you doing?
s09_e07_c08_u141	You don't wanna see what I just saw! (at this moment Monica comes home, and sees Chandler flat on his back on the floor and Joey pinning him down)
s09_e07_c08_u142	What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning coming from the TV and looks at it) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only takes a split second for Joey to realise, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and she falls, face down next to Chandler. Chandler gets up a bit, and Joey quickly covers Chandler's eyes with his hand.)
s09_e07_c09_u143	Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... (Rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... No response from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... (Rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... (Rachel's face is telling "Oh what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she starts to rap) I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (Emma starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! (Rachel now really gets into it, and her insecure movements start getting better) I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma and Ross now enters)
s09_e07_c09_u144	Hey!
s09_e07_c09_u145	Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
s09_e07_c09_u146	Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
s09_e07_c09_u147	Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
s09_e07_c09_u148	You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
s09_e07_c09_u149	Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
s09_e07_c10_u150	...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
s09_e07_c10_u151	Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
s09_e07_c10_u152	Oh, Pervert Parade?
s09_e07_c10_u153	(sighs) No...
s09_e07_c10_u154	Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?
s09_e07_c10_u155	Stop! (The butler serves dinner)
s09_e07_c10_u156	Oh God! Is that veal?
s09_e07_c10_u157	Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
s09_e07_c10_u158	Oh!
s09_e07_c10_u159	Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...
s09_e07_c10_u160	Phoebe you don't have to eat...
s09_e07_c10_u161	No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... (she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and holds it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome her vegetarian thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... Clearly not enjoying the meat...) Hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it, except Mike. He's making a hmmmm.... face... Then Phoebe swallows it) Hmmm... (at first she likes it, but then, in an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. You hear a door slamming.)
s09_e07_c10_u162	So...? What do you think? (looks at his parents, which look in disgust)
s09_e07_c11_u163	So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
s09_e07_c11_u164	Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
s09_e07_c11_u165	That tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
s09_e07_c11_u166	(laughs) Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... (Monica keeps looking at Joey) Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later. (Joey walks out)
s09_e07_c11_u167	Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
s09_e07_c11_u168	Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
s09_e07_c11_u169	Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
s09_e07_c11_u170	This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
s09_e07_c11_u171	Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
s09_e07_c11_u172	Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
s09_e07_c11_u173	Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
s09_e07_c11_u174	Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
s09_e07_c11_u175	Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she turns on the video again)
s09_e07_c11_u176	Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
s09_e07_c11_u177	THAT'S NOT ME!
s09_e07_c11_u178	What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
s09_e07_c11_u179	That bastard taped over me! (Chandler's expression changes)
s09_e07_c11_u180	Is that a problem?
s09_e07_c11_u181	I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!
s09_e07_c12_u182	I can't imagine what he sees in her.
s09_e07_c12_u183	She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his. (Mike walks in) Oh, hello dear...
s09_e07_c12_u184	Hey, what's going on?
s09_e07_c12_u185	We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?
s09_e07_c12_u186	A little better.
s09_e07_c12_u187	By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
s09_e07_c12_u188	You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.
s09_e07_c12_u189	I'm not interested.
s09_e07_c12_u190	Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...
s09_e07_c12_u191	All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...
s09_e07_c12_u192	Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! (Phoebe almost enters the room, but she hears the discussion and waits and evesdrops next to the door-opening.)
s09_e07_c12_u193	So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...
s09_e07_c12_u194	The woman you what? (Phoebe overheard what Michael said and now enters the room)
s09_e07_c12_u195	Yeah... The woman you what?
s09_e07_c12_u196	The woman I love... (he walks to Phoebe) I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...
s09_e07_c12_u197	I love you too...
s09_e07_c12_u198	You do?
s09_e07_c12_u199	YEAH...! How great is this...? (they kiss)
s09_e07_c12_u200	Wanna get out of here?
s09_e07_c12_u201	Okay.
s09_e07_c12_u202	Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.
s09_e07_c12_u203	I had a great time. (accent) It was really top drawer. And here's something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
s09_e07_c13_u204	She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
s09_e07_c13_u205	So fellas
s09_e07_c13_u206	Yeah!
s09_e07_c13_u207	fellas
s09_e07_c13_u208	Yeah!
s09_e07_c13_u209	has your girlfriend got the butt?
s09_e07_c13_u210	Hell yeah!
s09_e07_c13_u211	So shake it! (Rachel slaps Ross's butt on the beat)
s09_e07_c13_u212	Shake it!
s09_e07_c13_u213	Shake it! (Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica and Joey step in)
s09_e07_c13_u214	Shake it!
s09_e07_c13_u215	Shake that nasty butt...
s09_e07_c13_u216	Baby got back (Then Ross turns around and sees their friends standing in the doorway)
s09_e07_c13_u217	One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br... (She also turns and sees the gang)
s09_e07_c13_u218	Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
s05_e11_c01_u001	All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
s05_e11_c01_u002	(deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
s05_e11_c01_u003	What's the matter?!
s05_e11_c01_u004	We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know
s05_e11_c01_u005	All right, I'll take care of it.
s05_e11_c01_u006	Oh no, wait! Joey!
s05_e11_c01_u007	(hopping) 73! 72! 71!
s05_e11_c01_u008	Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
s05_e11_c01_u009	What?
s05_e11_c01_u010	Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.
s05_e11_c01_u011	Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.
s05_e11_c01_u012	Chandler.
s05_e11_c01_u013	Awww, man! Really?
s05_e11_c01_u014	Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?
s05_e11_c01_u015	That's a good point.
s05_e11_c01_u016	Yeah.
s05_e11_c01_u017	Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
s05_e11_c01_u018	Okay, great!
s05_e11_c01_u019	All right.
s05_e11_c01_u020	Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
s05_e11_c01_u021	It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?
s05_e11_c01_u022	Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
s05_e11_c01_u023	What?!
s05_e11_c01_u024	Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
s05_e11_c01_u025	So?
s05_e11_c01_u026	So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?
s05_e11_c01_u027	Oh, good point.
s05_e11_c01_u028	Yeah!
s05_e11_c01_u029	(watching the ball drop) 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
s05_e11_c01_u030	(To Monica) Happy New Year!
s05_e11_c01_u031	Happy New Year.
s05_e11_c01_u032	(To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!
s05_e11_c01_u033	You too!
s05_e11_c01_u034	(To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!
s05_e11_c01_u035	So did that do anything for ya?
s05_e11_c02_u036	Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
s05_e11_c02_u037	But your divorce isn't even final yet.
s05_e11_c02_u038	Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
s05_e11_c02_u039	Do you want us to leave the room, or?
s05_e11_c02_u040	Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
s05_e11_c02_u041	Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
s05_e11_c02_u042	That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
s05_e11_c02_u043	Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
s05_e11_c02_u044	She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
s05_e11_c02_u045	In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.
s05_e11_c02_u046	I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!
s05_e11_c02_u047	All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
s05_e11_c02_u048	Ohh.
s05_e11_c02_u049	Really?! How come?
s05_e11_c02_u050	Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
s05_e11_c02_u051	Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
s05_e11_c02_u052	Really? Who-who have you taught?
s05_e11_c02_u053	Well, I taught me and I love me.
s05_e11_c02_u054	Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
s05_e11_c02_u055	Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
s05_e11_c02_u056	Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
s05_e11_c02_u057	I don't gossip!
s05_e11_c02_u058	Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
s05_e11_c02_u059	Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
s05_e11_c02_u060	What? They were like this!
s05_e11_c03_u061	Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!
s05_e11_c03_u062	I just asked that girl out.
s05_e11_c03_u063	Nice!
s05_e11_c03_u064	Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
s05_e11_c03_u065	Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name and phone number on it.)
s05_e11_c03_u066	(reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
s05_e11_c03_u067	That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
s05_e11_c03_u068	Horn-swoggle.
s05_e11_c03_u069	You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
s05_e11_c03_u070	No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits down rubbing his temple.)
s05_e11_c03_u071	Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep quiet as Phoebe enters.)
s05_e11_c03_u072	Hi, Pheebs!
s05_e11_c03_u073	Hey!
s05_e11_c03_u074	Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's ear.) Hornswoggle.
s05_e11_c03_u075	Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.
s05_e11_c03_u076	All right, see you later.
s05_e11_c03_u077	See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
s05_e11_c03_u078	Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the guitar.)
s05_e11_c03_u079	Umm, okay.
s05_e11_c03_u080	Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use your imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)
s05_e11_c03_u081	What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
s05_e11_c04_u082	Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
s05_e11_c04_u083	I didn't! Even when I found out-umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. (Goes into her room.)
s05_e11_c04_u084	Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's chords.)
s05_e11_c04_u085	Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)
s05_e11_c04_u086	Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and
s05_e11_c04_u087	Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
s05_e11_c04_u088	No.
s05_e11_c04_u089	Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings. Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
s05_e11_c04_u090	Yes!
s05_e11_c04_u091	Then don't touch one!!
s05_e11_c04_u092	(entering, with Ben) Hi!
s05_e11_c04_u093	Hi!
s05_e11_c04_u094	Hi Ben!
s05_e11_c04_u095	Auntie Monica!! (He runs to hug her.)
s05_e11_c04_u096	(notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!
s05_e11_c04_u097	I think they're very nice.
s05_e11_c04_u098	I like 'em.
s05_e11_c04_u099	Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
s05_e11_c04_u100	I like them a lot.
s05_e11_c04_u101	That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe there's something in that area.
s05_e11_c04_u102	Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, (To Chandler) I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
s05_e11_c04_u103	Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
s05_e11_c04_u104	(after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?
s05_e11_c04_u105	You look like a freak.
s05_e11_c04_u106	Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and Monica.)
s05_e11_c04_u107	What are you, what are you doing?
s05_e11_c04_u108	It's my New Year's resolution!
s05_e11_c04_u109	What, to blind my child?
s05_e11_c04_u110	No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
s05_e11_c04_u111	Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)
s05_e11_c05_u112	(talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot?
s05_e11_c05_u113	Okay, it must just be me then.
s05_e11_c05_u114	That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
s05_e11_c05_u115	No, go ahead.
s05_e11_c05_u116	Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another word he heads into her bathroom.)
s05_e11_c05_u117	(in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh---.
s05_e11_c05_u118	(yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
s05_e11_c05_u119	'Kay!
s05_e11_c05_u120	Oh my God!
s05_e11_c06_u121	Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
s05_e11_c06_u122	Yes! Yes, I did.
s05_e11_c06_u123	Then do Iceberg!
s05_e11_c06_u124	(thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.
s05_e11_c06_u125	G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? (Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God!
s05_e11_c06_u126	What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
s05_e11_c06_u127	No, but you're questioning my method!
s05_e11_c06_u128	No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)
s05_e11_c06_u129	Thank you. (Leaves.)
s05_e11_c06_u130	Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
s05_e11_c06_u131	Your other student, was you!
s05_e11_c06_u132	Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
s05_e11_c06_u133	(looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)
s05_e11_c06_u134	Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!
s05_e11_c06_u135	(entering, singing) "Baddest man in the whole damn town."
s05_e11_c06_u136	Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)
s05_e11_c06_u137	(on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
s05_e11_c06_u138	(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
s05_e11_c06_u139	(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
s05_e11_c06_u140	Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
s05_e11_c07_u141	(answering phone) Hello?
s05_e11_c07_u142	(calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
s05_e11_c07_u143	Uhh, Chandler's not here.
s05_e11_c07_u144	Well, you can help me!
s05_e11_c07_u145	Okay.
s05_e11_c07_u146	Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom
s05_e11_c07_u147	Nice!
s05_e11_c07_u148	No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
s05_e11_c07_u149	Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?
s05_e11_c07_u150	Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.)
s05_e11_c07_u151	Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
s05_e11_c07_u152	Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.) They're not coming on man.
s05_e11_c07_u153	Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?
s05_e11_c07_u154	Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
s05_e11_c07_u155	Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
s05_e11_c07_u156	Hold on.
s05_e11_c07_u157	Ross? You okay?
s05_e11_c07_u158	They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
s05_e11_c07_u159	Really?! Uhh, what color is it?
s05_e11_c07_u160	What difference does that make?!
s05_e11_c07_u161	Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
s05_e11_c07_u162	(entering) Joey, do you have a minute?
s05_e11_c07_u163	Dude, what am I gonna
s05_e11_c07_u164	(To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)
s05_e11_c07_u165	Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
s05_e11_c07_u166	Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
s05_e11_c07_u167	Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
s05_e11_c07_u168	What-what is it, what is it?
s05_e11_c07_u169	Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
s05_e11_c07_u170	Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
s05_e11_c07_u171	Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
s05_e11_c07_u172	I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
s05_e11_c07_u173	What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
s05_e11_c07_u174	And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
s05_e11_c07_u175	I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone- (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his current state.)
s05_e11_c07_u176	I'm not listening to you!
s05_e11_c08_u177	Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.
s05_e11_c08_u178	All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
s05_e11_c08_u179	No, let's just leave the lights on.
s05_e11_c08_u180	Oh my God!
s05_e11_c08_u181	I had a problem.
s05_e11_c09_u182	Hey, Pheebs?
s05_e11_c09_u183	No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
s05_e11_c09_u184	Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You really think I'm ready?
s05_e11_c09_u185	Uh-huh!
s05_e11_c09_u186	Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note. However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)
s05_e11_c09_u187	(sitting back down) Was the chord at least right
s05_e11_c09_u188	No!
s05_e11_c10_u189	Oh my God!
s05_e11_c10_u190	We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
s05_e11_c10_u191	This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
s05_e11_c10_u192	No. No, you're not a loser.
s05_e11_c10_u193	Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
s05_e11_c10_u194	Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
s05_e11_c10_u195	Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
s05_e11_c10_u196	See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
s05_e11_c10_u197	Yeah!
s05_e11_c10_u198	That really is something; that's really cool.
s05_e11_c10_u199	Howdy partner!
s05_e11_c10_u200	Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)
s05_e11_c10_u201	Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
s05_e11_c10_u202	Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.
s05_e11_c10_u203	Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
s05_e11_c10_u204	Good luck, honey!
s05_e11_c10_u205	Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)
s05_e11_c10_u206	Hey, uh, Joey?
s05_e11_c10_u207	Umm?
s05_e11_c10_u208	Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
s05_e11_c10_u209	Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)
s05_e11_c10_u210	I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
s05_e11_c10_u211	Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
s05_e11_c10_u212	(quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
s05_e11_c10_u213	Now? You want me to go over there now?
s05_e11_c10_u214	Yeah!
s05_e11_c10_u215	Do you know something?
s05_e11_c10_u216	Do you know something?
s05_e11_c10_u217	I might know something.
s05_e11_c10_u218	I might know something too.
s05_e11_c10_u219	What's the thing you know?
s05_e11_c10_u220	Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
s05_e11_c10_u221	I can't tell you what I know.
s05_e11_c10_u222	Well then I can't tell you what I know.
s05_e11_c10_u223	Okay, fine.
s05_e11_c10_u224	You don't know!
s05_e11_c10_u225	All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! (Note: Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that line. She said it very quickly and didn't screw up a word. Try it yourself, it ain't that easy.)
s05_e11_c10_u226	(gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!
s05_e11_c10_u227	AND YOU KNOW!!!
s05_e11_c10_u228	Yeah, I know!!!!
s05_e11_c10_u229	Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
s05_e11_c10_u230	Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen- (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)
s05_e11_c10_u231	Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So
s05_e11_c10_u232	Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
s05_e11_c10_u233	Ohhh, yeah, me too.
s05_e11_c10_u234	That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.
s05_e11_c11_u235	(entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)
s08_e01_c01_u001	Great. (Takes a picture.) Great! Just give me a sec to change film.
s08_e01_c01_u002	Okay.
s08_e01_c01_u003	(To Monica) Okay, I know I'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!
s08_e01_c01_u004	What? What's going on?
s08_e01_c01_u005	Monica's pregnant!
s08_e01_c01_u006	Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
s08_e01_c01_u007	Guys! I'm not pregnant.
s08_e01_c01_u008	Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)
s08_e01_c01_u009	What?! What do you mean? You-you-you're not pregnant?
s08_e01_c01_u010	You didn't tell anybody I was did you?!
s08_e01_c01_u011	No! (Pause) I'll be right back. (Exits.)
s08_e01_c01_u012	Now why don't we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.
s08_e01_c01_u013	(To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
s08_e01_c01_u014	I can't! I-I don't have any other clothes here.
s08_e01_c01_u015	Find some! Please! Anything that doesn't say I-I died tragically in France. (Joey leaves to find clothes.)
s08_e01_c01_u016	Well then why don't we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.
s08_e01_c01_u017	Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?
s08_e01_c01_u018	Because I'm not.
s08_e01_c01_u019	We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant-(She sees Rachel shaking her head)-It's because I am.
s08_e01_c01_u020	What?! What are you talking about?
s08_e01_c01_u021	What are you talking about?
s08_e01_c01_u022	Yes, I-I am with child. (Flash) And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.
s08_e01_c01_u023	Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
s08_e01_c01_u024	Who's the father?
s08_e01_c01_u025	Yeah!
s08_e01_c01_u026	I can't say.
s08_e01_c01_u027	Why?!
s08_e01_c01_u028	Why not?
s08_e01_c01_u029	I can't say because he's famous.
s08_e01_c01_u030	Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)
s08_e01_c01_u031	Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
s08_e01_c01_u032	Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
s08_e01_c01_u033	As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
s08_e01_c01_u034	What?! Well he never said that to me!
s08_e01_c02_u035	Why don't we have Monica step away and we'll get Chandler and the bridemaids.
s08_e01_c02_u036	How about just the bridemaids?
s08_e01_c02_u037	Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
s08_e01_c02_u038	It is.
s08_e01_c02_u039	For you. (Chandler leaves.)
s08_e01_c02_u040	Oh my God!
s08_e01_c02_u041	Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
s08_e01_c02_u042	So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
s08_e01_c02_u043	You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you.
s08_e01_c02_u044	Sneaky.
s08_e01_c02_u045	Oh yeah.
s08_e01_c02_u046	Smile ladies.
s08_e01_c02_u047	Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?
s08_e01_c02_u048	Uh-hmm.
s08_e01_c02_u049	James Brolin?
s08_e01_c02_u050	Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.
s08_e01_c02_u051	Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
s08_e01_c02_u052	(intrigued) Really?!
s08_e01_c03_u053	Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!
s08_e01_c03_u054	Before we go out there I've got a present for ya.
s08_e01_c03_u055	Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!
s08_e01_c03_u056	No?
s08_e01_c03_u057	No.
s08_e01_c03_u058	I've been taking dancing lessons.
s08_e01_c03_u059	What?!
s08_e01_c03_u060	Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
s08_e01_c03_u061	Oh that is so sweet!
s08_e01_c03_u062	So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
s08_e01_c03_u063	Yes.
s08_e01_c03_u064	What's the matter?
s08_e01_c03_u065	I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
s08_e01_c03_u066	Well, are you going to be able to do this?
s08_e01_c03_u067	Not well.
s08_e01_c03_u068	Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
s08_e01_c03_u069	So, are you ready to talk about it?
s08_e01_c03_u070	No.
s08_e01_c03_u071	Now?
s08_e01_c03_u072	No!
s08_e01_c03_u073	Okay, we'll talk about something else then.
s08_e01_c03_u074	Thank you.
s08_e01_c03_u075	Who's the father?!
s08_e01_c03_u076	Ugh! Look honey y'know what? I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else.
s08_e01_c03_u077	Yeah. That's fine. That's fair. Is it Tag?
s08_e01_c03_u078	Phoebe!!
s08_e01_c03_u079	Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.
s08_e01_c03_u080	Okay.
s08_e01_c03_u081	Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it-Oh my God, it's Joey!
s08_e01_c03_u082	Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
s08_e01_c03_u083	Ah-hah! At least we know it's a him.
s08_e01_c03_u084	(seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.
s08_e01_c03_u085	I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?
s08_e01_c03_u086	Honey, I'm not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)
s08_e01_c03_u087	Hi. I'm uh, I'm Ross. I don't, I don't believe we've met. I'm Monica's older brother.
s08_e01_c03_u088	Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
s08_e01_c03_u089	You think so? I've always kinda hated it.
s08_e01_c03_u090	Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
s08_e01_c03_u091	Uh-huh.
s08_e01_c03_u092	Mona umm-Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she's uh-well she's dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
s08_e01_c03_u093	Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
s08_e01_c03_u094	Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh, uh me too.
s08_e01_c03_u095	Oh good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.
s08_e01_c03_u096	(sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you've just been bumped up to table one. And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table six-Martin Clickclocken.
s08_e01_c03_u097	That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)
s08_e01_c03_u098	Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
s08_e01_c03_u099	Congratulations.
s08_e01_c03_u100	Thank you.
s08_e01_c03_u101	Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
s08_e01_c03_u102	Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
s08_e01_c03_u103	Oh, I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.
s08_e01_c03_u104	Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
s08_e01_c03_u105	I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani.
s08_e01_c03_u106	Dennis Phillips
s08_e01_c03_u107	Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff.
s08_e01_c03_u108	Oh, thank you. Well if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)
s08_e01_c03_u109	Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
s08_e01_c03_u110	Well, it's a funny story.
s08_e01_c03_u111	Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)
s08_e01_c03_u112	Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.
s08_e01_c03_u113	Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
s08_e01_c03_u114	No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)
s08_e01_c03_u115	Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well I'm- (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.
s08_e01_c03_u116	Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people.
s08_e01_c03_u117	What size shoes do you wear?
s08_e01_c03_u118	Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
s08_e01_c03_u119	Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
s08_e01_c03_u120	Uh, I don't even really know where I left those. Sorry.
s08_e01_c03_u121	(looking at Joey's feet) Those aren't eleven and a half.
s08_e01_c03_u122	Okay fine! I'm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!
s08_e01_c03_u123	Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
s08_e01_c03_u124	Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
s08_e01_c03_u125	This is so huge.
s08_e01_c03_u126	Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
s08_e01_c03_u127	Of course not nothing is. Between me and you
s08_e01_c03_u128	Yeah.
s08_e01_c03_u129	in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
s08_e01_c03_u130	Hey! Y'know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they're supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!
s08_e01_c03_u131	How?
s08_e01_c03_u132	I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
s08_e01_c03_u133	Well I-I talked to and uh, she's definitely going to have this baby. Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
s08_e01_c03_u134	Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.
s08_e01_c03_u135	Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
s08_e01_c03_u136	Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
s08_e01_c03_u137	Well, there's a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she's not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
s08_e01_c03_u138	(starting to cry) I don't know.
s08_e01_c03_u139	Are you okay?
s08_e01_c03_u140	Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
s08_e01_c03_u141	Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesn't work.) Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
s08_e01_c04_u142	Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin
s08_e01_c04_u143	Oh really?!
s08_e01_c04_u144	Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said
s08_e01_c04_u145	(interrupting) Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
s08_e01_c04_u146	(shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?
s08_e01_c04_u147	How do you feel?
s08_e01_c04_u148	I don't know. I don't know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don't want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!
s08_e01_c04_u149	Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
s08_e01_c04_u150	What?!
s08_e01_c04_u151	When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.
s08_e01_c04_u152	Yes! Maybe it's a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
s08_e01_c04_u153	How many ways are there to do that?
s08_e01_c04_u154	I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure.
s08_e01_c04_u155	All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home.
s08_e01_c04_u156	You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
s08_e01_c04_u157	Okay. Thank you.
s08_e01_c04_u158	Okay.
s08_e01_c04_u159	I'll run out and get you one.
s08_e01_c04_u160	Oh, you guys are so great.
s08_e01_c04_u161	Oh, wait a minute! Who's is the father?!
s08_e01_c04_u162	Oh no, she won't tell us.
s08_e01_c04_u163	Oh, come on it's my wedding! That can be my present.
s08_e01_c04_u164	Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
s08_e01_c04_u165	See? This is why you register.
s08_e01_c04_u166	It was the chair again! Okay? I'm not doing it! It what-look, I don't-y'know what-eh-eh- (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.
s08_e01_c04_u167	Hi!
s08_e01_c04_u168	Umm, would you like to dance?
s08_e01_c04_u169	Sure.
s08_e01_c04_u170	Yeah?
s08_e01_c04_u171	Yeah.
s08_e01_c04_u172	Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
s08_e01_c04_u173	Dr. Geller?
s08_e01_c04_u174	I wasn't farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the little girl) Yes?
s08_e01_c04_u175	Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
s08_e01_c04_u176	Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.
s08_e01_c04_u177	Okay. (She drops her head in disappointment and walks away.)
s08_e01_c04_u178	Ohhhh!
s08_e01_c04_u179	Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.
s08_e01_c04_u180	I'd be happy to. (To Ross) You are very sweet.
s08_e01_c04_u181	Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don't we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
s08_e01_c04_u182	Sure!
s08_e01_c04_u183	Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?
s08_e01_c04_u184	Uh-huh.
s08_e01_c04_u185	Keep dancing.
s08_e01_c04_u186	And the world will never know.
s08_e01_c04_u187	Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
s08_e01_c04_u188	Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
s08_e01_c04_u189	No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
s08_e01_c04_u190	But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
s08_e01_c04_u191	Hey!
s08_e01_c04_u192	Thank you.
s08_e01_c04_u193	No-no, thank you Miranda.
s08_e01_c04_u194	Melinda!
s08_e01_c04_u195	All right. (Walks over to Mona.)
s08_e01_c04_u196	How cute was that?
s08_e01_c04_u197	Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
s08_e01_c04_u198	Can I go next?
s08_e01_c04_u199	What? Of course you can! Hop on!
s08_e01_c04_u200	Okay, but I get to hop on after her. (Ross bites the air in response.)
s08_e01_c04_u201	I am so gonna score.
s08_e01_c04_u202	What?
s08_e01_c04_u203	I like your bow.
s08_e01_c04_u204	(clinks his glass) I'd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) I'm sorry. And-and some scared memories-Whoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!
s08_e01_c04_u205	Thank you.
s08_e01_c04_u206	(to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.
s08_e01_c04_u207	No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)
s08_e01_c04_u208	So, is it my turn now?
s08_e01_c04_u209	I'm next!
s08_e01_c04_u210	Oh! (Recoils in horror.)
s08_e01_c04_u211	Uh, that's okay. You can dance with her first.
s08_e01_c04_u212	Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what's uh, what's your name.
s08_e01_c04_u213	Gert!
s08_e01_c04_u214	That's, that's pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Ross's feet, but he pulls them out of harm's way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
s08_e01_c04_u215	Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
s08_e01_c04_u216	Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
s08_e01_c04_u217	Why aren't you moving your feet?
s08_e01_c04_u218	I'm trying. (He strains to move his feet.)
s08_e01_c04_u219	Faster! You're not going fast enough!
s08_e01_c04_u220	Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert's shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)
s08_e01_c04_u221	So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
s08_e01_c04_u222	Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
s08_e01_c04_u223	Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show
s08_e01_c04_u224	Look umm Joey, I-I don't think you're quite right for this project.
s08_e01_c04_u225	Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me.
s08_e01_c04_u226	It's an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
s08_e01_c04_u227	Well I'm not proud of this, but- (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)
s08_e01_c04_u228	Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don't-don't-don't!
s08_e01_c04_u229	Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
s08_e01_c04_u230	Did it turn into sand?
s08_e01_c04_u231	Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)
s08_e01_c04_u232	(sliding up behind her) No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
s08_e01_c04_u233	Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn't matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.
s08_e01_c04_u234	Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested.
s08_e01_c04_u235	Why?
s08_e01_c04_u236	You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and Chandler stops.)
s08_e01_c05_u237	How much longer?
s08_e01_c05_u238	30 seconds.
s08_e01_c05_u239	30 seconds, okay.
s08_e01_c05_u240	(entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it's positive, we're gonna
s08_e01_c05_u241	Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)
s08_e01_c05_u242	It's time.
s08_e01_c05_u243	Go ahead Rach.
s08_e01_c05_u244	Oh wait! Y'know what? I can't, I can't look at it. I can't. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
s08_e01_c05_u245	Okay.
s08_e01_c05_u246	Okay.
s08_e01_c05_u247	Umm, it's negative.
s08_e01_c05_u248	What?
s08_e01_c05_u249	It's negative.
s08_e01_c05_u250	Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is-that's great-that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y'know cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.
s08_e01_c05_u251	Well- Well, great.
s08_e01_c05_u252	Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)
s08_e01_c05_u253	Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset over something I never had? It's negative?
s08_e01_c05_u254	No, it's positive.
s08_e01_c05_u255	What?!
s08_e01_c05_u256	It's-it's not negative, it's positive.
s08_e01_c05_u257	Are you sure?
s08_e01_c05_u258	Well yeah, I lied before.
s08_e01_c05_u259	Oh!
s08_e01_c05_u260	Oh God
s08_e01_c05_u261	Now you know how you really feel about it.
s08_e01_c05_u262	Oh-oh, that's a risky little game!
s08_e01_c05_u263	Are you really gonna do this?
s08_e01_c05_u264	Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby! (They all hug.)
s08_e01_c05_u265	With who?
s08_e01_c05_u266	Ah, it's still not the time.
s08_e01_c06_u267	I just didn't see the fast song coming.
s08_e01_c06_u268	Shh. Shh. Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay.
s08_e01_c06_u269	Oh, thank you.
s08_e01_c06_u270	That is so sweet!
s08_e01_c06_u271	Yeah.
s08_e01_c06_u272	No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
s08_e01_c06_u273	Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself.
s08_e01_c06_u274	It's Joey right?
s08_e01_c06_u275	Yeah.
s08_e01_c06_u276	Wait a minute! No! I'm the nice one! I'm the one who danced with the kids all night! How-How small are your feet?! (They all look down.)
s09_e23_c01_u001	(entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
s09_e23_c01_u002	Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
s09_e23_c01_u003	Mmh-mmh.
s09_e23_c01_u004	(to Emma) Can you say Barbados?
s09_e23_c01_u005	Barbados!
s09_e23_c01_u006	Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
s09_e23_c01_u007	Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
s09_e23_c01_u008	Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
s09_e23_c01_u009	I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
s09_e23_c01_u010	Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
s09_e23_c01_u011	No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
s09_e23_c01_u012	Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
s09_e23_c01_u013	All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
s09_e23_c01_u014	It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
s09_e23_c02_u015	Wow! This place is beautiful!
s09_e23_c02_u016	(very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!
s09_e23_c02_u017	I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)
s09_e23_c02_u018	Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
s09_e23_c02_u019	(to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
s09_e23_c02_u020	Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
s09_e23_c02_u021	That... never happens...
s09_e23_c02_u022	I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
s09_e23_c02_u023	Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
s09_e23_c02_u024	I would love your autograph. (hands him a notepad)
s09_e23_c02_u025	Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..." (he takes the notepad)
s09_e23_c02_u026	Sarah.
s09_e23_c02_u027	"... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
s09_e23_c02_u028	Thank you so much!
s09_e23_c02_u029	Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
s09_e23_c02_u030	(to Joey) Are you a paleontologist?
s09_e23_c02_u031	No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
s09_e23_c02_u032	Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
s09_e23_c02_u033	(thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
s09_e23_c02_u034	I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
s09_e23_c02_u035	You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
s09_e23_c03_u036	David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
s09_e23_c03_u037	Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
s09_e23_c03_u038	(to Chandler) See?
s09_e23_c03_u039	Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
s09_e23_c03_u040	Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
s09_e23_c03_u041	Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
s09_e23_c03_u042	Mike?? Who's Mike?
s09_e23_c03_u043	Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
s09_e23_c03_u044	That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
s09_e23_c03_u045	It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
s09_e23_c03_u046	Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
s09_e23_c03_u047	(upset) She does?
s09_e23_c03_u048	(pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)
s09_e23_c03_u049	At least you took me down with you!
s09_e23_c03_u050	I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
s09_e23_c03_u051	I guess, in time.
s09_e23_c03_u052	Yeah.
s09_e23_c03_u053	I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
s09_e23_c03_u054	You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
s09_e23_c04_u055	(to Chandler) Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?
s09_e23_c04_u056	I wouldn't read too much into it.
s09_e23_c04_u057	Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?
s09_e23_c04_u058	David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
s09_e23_c04_u059	Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...
s09_e23_c04_u060	Seriously, we're gonna do this?
s09_e23_c04_u061	I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
s09_e23_c04_u062	Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
s09_e23_c04_u063	That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!
s09_e23_c04_u064	What?
s09_e23_c04_u065	Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
s09_e23_c04_u066	I didn't mean now...
s09_e23_c04_u067	Why not? It's brilliant! (talking to an imaginary Mike) Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! (pause) well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... (to Chandler) Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
s09_e23_c04_u068	Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
s09_e23_c04_u069	(after a while) How do you think I should propose?
s09_e23_c04_u070	David, I'm pretending to read here!!
s09_e23_c05_u071	Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
s09_e23_c05_u072	Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?
s09_e23_c05_u073	(laughing) I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
s09_e23_c05_u074	You really should have been more clear about that!
s09_e23_c05_u075	Hey!
s09_e23_c05_u076	Hey!
s09_e23_c05_u077	(Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
s09_e23_c05_u078	Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
s09_e23_c05_u079	Yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
s09_e23_c05_u080	Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
s09_e23_c05_u081	Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
s09_e23_c05_u082	You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)
s09_e23_c05_u083	(to Charlie) Ready to go?
s09_e23_c05_u084	Yeah!
s09_e23_c05_u085	Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
s09_e23_c05_u086	Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
s09_e23_c05_u087	Yeah.
s09_e23_c05_u088	But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
s09_e23_c05_u089	(smiling) Will you wear a thong?
s09_e23_c05_u090	I will if you will.
s09_e23_c05_u091	Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
s09_e23_c05_u092	(a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them).
s09_e23_c05_u093	So you'll be ok?
s09_e23_c05_u094	Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
s09_e23_c05_u095	Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
s09_e23_c05_u096	No, why?
s09_e23_c05_u097	Oh man!
s09_e23_c05_u098	There's an indoor pool, you can swim there! (Ross agrees)
s09_e23_c05_u099	I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)
s09_e23_c06_u100	Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
s09_e23_c06_u101	(smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) "I do".
s09_e23_c06_u102	Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
s09_e23_c06_u103	David is going to propose to Phoebe.
s09_e23_c06_u104	What? (looks very shocked) Why?
s09_e23_c06_u105	Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
s09_e23_c06_u106	Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
s09_e23_c06_u107	I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
s09_e23_c06_u108	They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
s09_e23_c06_u109	Man, that's some bad advice!
s09_e23_c07_u110	Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
s09_e23_c07_u111	Hey! Hey what's going on?
s09_e23_c07_u112	Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
s09_e23_c07_u113	Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
s09_e23_c07_u114	Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
s09_e23_c07_u115	That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
s09_e23_c07_u116	Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)
s09_e23_c07_u117	(to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
s09_e23_c07_u118	(shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
s09_e23_c07_u119	(shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe).
s09_e23_c07_u120	Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy.
s09_e23_c07_u121	Not Joey.
s09_e23_c07_u122	Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
s09_e23_c07_u123	Yeah, right!
s09_e23_c07_u124	So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight. (Removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show Chandler the ring)
s09_e23_c07_u125	Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!
s09_e23_c07_u126	Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.
s09_e23_c07_u127	(slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)
s09_e23_c07_u128	Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)
s09_e23_c07_u129	Ok!
s09_e23_c07_u130	David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
s09_e23_c07_u131	See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
s09_e23_c07_u132	That would be advice!!
s09_e23_c07_u133	Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?
s09_e23_c07_u134	Yeah?
s09_e23_c07_u135	(looking very serious) I need to talk to you.
s09_e23_c07_u136	Are you leaving "The Supremes"? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)
s09_e23_c07_u137	Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
s09_e23_c07_u138	Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
s09_e23_c07_u139	What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
s09_e23_c07_u140	Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..." (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout "No! No!") You know, it's every girl's dream!
s09_e23_c07_u141	Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
s09_e23_c07_u142	Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
s09_e23_c08_u143	By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
s09_e23_c08_u144	It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
s09_e23_c08_u145	Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler).
s09_e23_c08_u146	Hey guys!
s09_e23_c08_u147	The chocolates aren't here yet.
s09_e23_c08_u148	Damnit!
s09_e23_c08_u149	Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
s09_e23_c08_u150	Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
s09_e23_c08_u151	If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)
s09_e23_c08_u152	(offended) What? (pause) May I?
s09_e23_c08_u153	(looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
s09_e23_c08_u154	Actually the wet season is June to December.
s09_e23_c08_u155	It's not the time Charlie.
s09_e23_c08_u156	(at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
s09_e23_c08_u157	Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh! Secret teapot?
s09_e23_c08_u158	Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
s09_e23_c08_u159	Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)
s09_e23_c08_u160	It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
s09_e23_c08_u161	What, oh my God. What did you do?
s09_e23_c08_u162	Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
s09_e23_c08_u163	Why, why would you open it?
s09_e23_c08_u164	Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
s09_e23_c08_u165	What did it say?
s09_e23_c08_u166	Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
s09_e23_c08_u167	What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!
s09_e23_c08_u168	It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
s09_e23_c08_u169	NO! I don't!!
s09_e23_c08_u170	Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
s09_e23_c08_u171	It's really gone?
s09_e23_c08_u172	Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
s09_e23_c08_u173	I just feel awful.
s09_e23_c08_u174	Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
s09_e23_c08_u175	Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)
s09_e23_c08_u176	Get out! (Chandler runs out)
s09_e23_c08_u177	You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
s09_e23_c08_u178	Well, what do you do?
s09_e23_c08_u179	Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
s09_e23_c08_u180	I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
s09_e23_c08_u181	I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
s09_e23_c08_u182	I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
s09_e23_c08_u183	Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
s09_e23_c08_u184	Wha... what you really think we can do that?
s09_e23_c08_u185	Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner (Looks at Joey).
s09_e23_c08_u186	Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
s09_e23_c08_u187	Ugh.
s09_e23_c08_u188	Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
s09_e23_c08_u189	Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).
s09_e23_c09_u190	Hello?
s09_e23_c09_u191	Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
s09_e23_c09_u192	Who is this?
s09_e23_c09_u193	This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
s09_e23_c09_u194	(sounds shocked and sits down) He... he's gonna propose?
s09_e23_c09_u195	I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)
s09_e23_c09_u196	Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.
s09_e23_c09_u197	You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damnit!
s09_e23_c09_u198	(sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!
s09_e23_c09_u199	(pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
s09_e23_c09_u200	Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
s09_e23_c09_u201	Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
s09_e23_c09_u202	No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
s09_e23_c09_u203	And there's not chance that will work?
s09_e23_c09_u204	No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
s09_e23_c09_u205	(pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
s09_e23_c09_u206	Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
s09_e23_c09_u207	This vacation sucks!!
s09_e23_c10_u208	I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
s09_e23_c10_u209	Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
s09_e23_c10_u210	Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
s09_e23_c10_u211	(stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
s09_e23_c10_u212	I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention (walks away)
s09_e23_c10_u213	Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
s09_e23_c10_u214	We can't. We're not pharmacists!
s09_e23_c10_u215	(walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba...
s09_e23_c10_u216	(picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?
s09_e23_c10_u217	Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)
s09_e23_c10_u218	And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
s09_e23_c10_u219	In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)
s09_e23_c10_u220	Thank you. (they walk away)
s09_e23_c11_u221	And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
s09_e23_c11_u222	Yeah, that's it?
s09_e23_c11_u223	Yeah.
s09_e23_c11_u224	Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
s09_e23_c11_u225	Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
s09_e23_c11_u226	Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace.
s09_e23_c11_u227	Thank you.
s09_e23_c11_u228	Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
s09_e23_c11_u229	Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.
s09_e23_c11_u230	Oh my God, I love you.
s09_e23_c11_u231	Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?
s09_e23_c11_u232	That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
s09_e23_c11_u233	Your first marriage?
s09_e23_c11_u234	Yeah.
s09_e23_c11_u235	You're married more than once?
s09_e23_c11_u236	No. (they clink glasses and drink)
s09_e23_c11_u237	So, why did you break up?
s09_e23_c11_u238	(embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
s09_e23_c11_u239	Oh my God, this is so cool!
s09_e23_c11_u240	Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
s09_e23_c11_u241	No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!
s09_e23_c11_u242	Hey! High-five! (they high-five)
s09_e23_c11_u243	Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
s09_e23_c11_u244	My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
s09_e23_c11_u245	Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: "Oh, I knew all along"
s09_e23_c11_u246	I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
s09_e23_c11_u247	I know!
s09_e23_c11_u248	And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
s09_e23_c11_u249	I didn't do that.
s09_e23_c11_u250	(embarassed) Me neither.
s09_e23_c12_u251	Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
s09_e23_c12_u252	I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
s09_e23_c12_u253	Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
s09_e23_c12_u254	Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
s09_e23_c12_u255	But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?
s09_e23_c12_u256	(takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No.
s09_e23_c12_u257	There it is, you're blushing!
s09_e23_c12_u258	No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
s09_e23_c12_u259	You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)
s09_e23_c12_u260	No.
s09_e23_c12_u261	Tell me who it is.
s09_e23_c12_u262	Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
s09_e23_c12_u263	Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
s09_e23_c12_u264	Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
s09_e23_c12_u265	What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
s09_e23_c12_u266	Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
s09_e23_c12_u267	(eagerly) Yeah, who is that?
s09_e23_c12_u268	Do ya?
s09_e23_c12_u269	Yeah.
s09_e23_c12_u270	Hey!
s09_e23_c12_u271	(to Joey) I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
s09_e23_c12_u272	Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
s09_e23_c12_u273	Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much.
s09_e23_c12_u274	I had a great time.
s09_e23_c12_u275	Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...
s09_e23_c12_u276	Later! La...
s09_e23_c12_u277	So, shall we?
s09_e23_c12_u278	Yeah. (they leave)
s09_e23_c12_u279	Ok. See you, bye.
s09_e23_c12_u280	Bye.
s09_e23_c12_u281	Good night.
s09_e23_c12_u282	Night.
s09_e23_c12_u283	Ok, good night!
s09_e23_c13_u284	I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
s09_e23_c13_u285	You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
s09_e23_c13_u286	Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
s09_e23_c13_u287	Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.
s09_e23_c13_u288	I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
s09_e23_c13_u289	Uh, Phoebe, uh... (Chandler hits his own head) you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
s09_e23_c13_u290	Sure, ok, yeah.
s09_e23_c13_u291	But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...
s09_e23_c13_u292	Oh my God, Mike!
s09_e23_c13_u293	It's David, actually!
s09_e23_c13_u294	No, Mike's here.
s09_e23_c13_u295	(turns around) Hi Mike!
s09_e23_c13_u296	Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!
s09_e23_c13_u297	IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
s09_e23_c13_u298	Hi Phoebe.
s09_e23_c13_u299	What are you, what are you doing here?
s09_e23_c13_u300	I have a question I need to ask you.
s09_e23_c13_u301	I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
s09_e23_c13_u302	Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
s09_e23_c13_u303	(annoyed) Ok, would you care for my seat as well?
s09_e23_c13_u304	Actually yeah, that'll be great.
s09_e23_c13_u305	That's fair, you've had a long trip. (he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)
s09_e23_c13_u306	Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
s09_e23_c13_u307	Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
s09_e23_c13_u308	Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
s09_e23_c13_u309	Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
s09_e23_c13_u310	You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...
s09_e23_c13_u311	I have a ring.
s09_e23_c13_u312	I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
s09_e23_c13_u313	Phoebe, will you marry me?
s09_e23_c13_u314	(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!
s09_e23_c13_u315	Uhm... Ha ha!
s09_e23_c13_u316	I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
s09_e23_c13_u317	We can have any future you want.
s09_e23_c13_u318	Ok, I'm gonna take off.
s09_e23_c13_u319	David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
s09_e23_c13_u320	Just so I know, if I had asked first...
s09_e23_c13_u321	Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
s09_e23_c13_u322	Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! (he leaves)
s09_e23_c13_u323	Is it ok if I hug you now?
s09_e23_c13_u324	Yes! (they hug)
s09_e23_c13_u325	(to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
s09_e23_c14_u326	Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
s09_e23_c14_u327	I know (she snuggles to him)
s09_e23_c14_u328	(walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
s09_e23_c14_u329	I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
s09_e23_c14_u330	The sun is out!
s09_e23_c14_u331	Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
s09_e23_c14_u332	Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
s09_e23_c14_u333	Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
s09_e23_c14_u334	Nooo!
s09_e23_c14_u335	Damn it!
s09_e23_c14_u336	(from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!
s09_e23_c15_u337	Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
s09_e23_c15_u338	Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
s09_e23_c15_u339	Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
s09_e23_c15_u340	(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.
s09_e23_c15_u341	And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
s09_e23_c15_u342	(to the one sitting next to him) Really?
s09_e23_c15_u343	But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
s09_e23_c15_u344	What?
s09_e23_c15_u345	He said "erectus"!
s09_e23_c15_u346	You're... you're kidding, right?
s09_e23_c15_u347	No, he really said it.
s09_e23_c15_u348	... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
s09_e23_c15_u349	Erectus?
s09_e23_c15_u350	Homo.
s09_e23_c16_u351	(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!
s09_e23_c16_u352	Oh, thanks guys!
s09_e23_c16_u353	(shaking hands with Ross) I thought... it was wonderful!
s09_e23_c16_u354	Oh!
s09_e23_c16_u355	Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. (sighs) I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... (sighs again and smiles at Ross blissfully).
s09_e23_c16_u356	(with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
s09_e23_c16_u357	All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?
s09_e23_c16_u358	Yeah!
s09_e23_c16_u359	(to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!
s09_e23_c16_u360	Oh, thank you so much!
s09_e23_c16_u361	Yeah, and so funny!
s09_e23_c16_u362	Oh!
s09_e23_c16_u363	(puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
s09_e23_c16_u364	(popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
s09_e23_c16_u365	Oh... I'm back!
s09_e23_c16_u366	(skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
s09_e23_c16_u367	Phoebe & Mike: Yeah! (they leave)
s09_e23_c16_u368	Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)
s09_e23_c16_u369	You were incredible!
s09_e23_c16_u370	Yeah?
s09_e23_c16_u371	You blew them away!
s09_e23_c16_u372	Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
s09_e23_c16_u373	(smiling broadly) I was not!
s09_e23_c16_u374	No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
s09_e23_c16_u375	Oh my God! (pauses) I'm your groupie!
s09_e23_c16_u376	(joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
s09_e23_c16_u377	(realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!
s09_e23_c17_u378	(her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
s09_e23_c17_u379	Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!
s09_e23_c17_u380	So, what are we gonna do today?
s09_e23_c17_u381	They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
s09_e23_c17_u382	(pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
s09_e23_c17_u383	I don't think so!
s09_e23_c17_u384	(disappointed) Why not?
s09_e23_c17_u385	Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
s09_e23_c17_u386	I'm not always that bad!
s09_e23_c17_u387	Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
s09_e23_c17_u388	(hesitatingly) I punched you...?
s09_e23_c17_u389	And...?
s09_e23_c17_u390	... Phoebe...?
s09_e23_c17_u391	... and...?
s09_e23_c17_u392	I clunked your heads together!
s09_e23_c18_u393	(walking in) Hey! There you are!
s09_e23_c18_u394	Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)
s09_e23_c18_u395	I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
s09_e23_c18_u396	(disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
s09_e23_c18_u397	You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and (pauses) especially last night...
s09_e23_c18_u398	(interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)
s09_e23_c18_u399	Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
s09_e23_c18_u400	(bewildered) Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
s09_e23_c18_u401	Yeah...
s09_e23_c18_u402	... is it weird that it's not with each other?
s09_e23_c18_u403	Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
s09_e23_c18_u404	(sitting down on the bed) I think we need to talk...!
s09_e23_c18_u405	Yeah... I think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?
s09_e23_c19_u406	C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
s09_e23_c19_u407	All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
s09_e23_c19_u408	But then how do we know who wins?
s09_e23_c19_u409	Nobody wins!
s09_e23_c19_u410	So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
s09_e23_c19_u411	I'm not playing with you.
s09_e23_c19_u412	Yeah, I'm out.
s09_e23_c19_u413	I'll play ya!
s09_e23_c19_u414	(smiling) OK!
s09_e23_c19_u415	Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
s09_e23_c19_u416	She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from Pictionary!
s09_e23_c19_u417	(disbelieving) I think I will be all right! (to Monica) You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
s09_e23_c19_u418	Sure! Got to!
s09_e23_c19_u419	Aww!
s09_e23_c19_u420	Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
s09_e23_c19_u421	(nearly whispering) Oh dear God, there's two of them!
s09_e23_c19_u422	You're ready to play?
s09_e23_c19_u423	Hell, yeah!
s09_e23_c19_u424	(to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?
s09_e23_c19_u425	No idea! I though he was soft like you!
s09_e23_c19_u426	Wanna make it more interesting?
s09_e23_c19_u427	How much were you thinking?
s09_e23_c19_u428	Ten bucks a game?
s09_e23_c19_u429	Make it fifty!
s09_e23_c19_u430	I'll make it a hundred!
s09_e23_c19_u431	(nearly shouting) One thousand...
s09_e23_c19_u432	(interrupting her) OK!
s09_e23_c19_u433	To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
s09_e23_c19_u434	(going through her pockets) No... (to Chandler and Phoebe) Either of you girls got a quarter?
s09_e23_c19_u435	Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
s09_e23_c19_u436	(picks up a coin from her bra) Monica, you call it.
s09_e23_c19_u437	Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
s09_e23_c19_u438	Tails!
s09_e23_c19_u439	(angry) Ow, what are the chances!
s09_e23_c19_u440	Ha! My point!
s09_e23_c19_u441	Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
s09_e23_c19_u442	(smiling proudly) He was a lawyer!
s09_e23_c20_u443	(meteorologist) (pointing to the East Coast)... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!
s09_e23_c20_u444	Oh! Weather bitch! (turns the TV off)
s09_e23_c20_u445	It's open! (Joey walks in) Hi, Joe!
s09_e23_c20_u446	(downhearted) Hey...
s09_e23_c20_u447	(worried) What, is everything ok?
s09_e23_c20_u448	Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
s09_e23_c20_u449	Nooooo, why?
s09_e23_c20_u450	Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
s09_e23_c20_u451	(laughing) Oh, that's crazy!
s09_e23_c20_u452	No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
s09_e23_c20_u453	... yeah, it's true.
s09_e23_c20_u454	I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
s09_e23_c20_u455	(pretending to be offended) What, hey!
s09_e23_c20_u456	(laughing sarcastically) Ok, Rach!
s09_e23_c20_u457	I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
s09_e23_c20_u458	W-What are you, what are you talking about?
s09_e23_c20_u459	Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... (sighs) What the hell is my problem? OH! (He falls back on the bed)
s09_e23_c20_u460	Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
s09_e23_c20_u461	(sitting up again) I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
s09_e23_c20_u462	Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
s09_e23_c20_u463	But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)
s09_e23_c20_u464	You know? Forget it!
s09_e23_c20_u465	(stands up) No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
s09_e23_c20_u466	No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
s09_e23_c20_u467	Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
s09_e23_c20_u468	Yeah, sure!
s09_e23_c21_u469	You like me? (shuts the door)
s09_e23_c21_u470	(nearly whispering) Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
s09_e23_c21_u471	(shocked) That's a huge thing!
s09_e23_c21_u472	Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!
s09_e23_c21_u473	What... for how long?
s09_e23_c21_u474	Only like a month!
s09_e23_c21_u475	(outraged) A MONTH??
s09_e23_c21_u476	What the... DIAL IT DOWN! (Joey goes to sit on the bed) Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at Joey, who's totally distraught) Ok, dial it up a little!
s09_e23_c21_u477	(stands up) I just have one question!
s09_e23_c21_u478	Shoot!
s09_e23_c21_u479	(desperate) What the hell are you doin'???
s09_e23_c21_u480	I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?...
s09_e23_c21_u481	Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
s09_e23_c21_u482	(puzzled) Who...?
s09_e23_c21_u483	CURIOUS GEORGE (see link)! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
s09_e23_c21_u484	Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
s09_e23_c21_u485	Yeah, he had a paper route.
s09_e23_c21_u486	Yeah, he did! (smiling) Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
s09_e23_c21_u487	No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
s09_e23_c21_u488	But can it... just... happen a little bit?
s09_e23_c21_u489	(charmed, but then recoiling) NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
s09_e23_c21_u490	But why, why not?
s09_e23_c21_u491	Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! (sighs) I couldn't do it to Ross!
s09_e23_c21_u492	But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
s09_e23_c21_u493	I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) I'm sorry...!
s09_e23_c21_u494	(regretful) I'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
s09_e23_c21_u495	NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
s09_e23_c21_u496	It's not a big deal!
s09_e23_c21_u497	NO BIG DEAL!
s09_e23_c21_u498	It's so not a big deal!
s09_e23_c21_u499	Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
s09_e23_c21_u500	Ok!
s09_e23_c21_u501	Ok, I...
s09_e23_c21_u502	AAAHHHH!
s09_e23_c22_u503	Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
s09_e23_c22_u504	Do you?
s09_e23_c22_u505	Ah, yeah!
s09_e23_c22_u506	Do you?
s09_e23_c22_u507	Ah, yeaaah!
s09_e23_c22_u508	DO YOU?
s09_e23_c22_u509	AH YEAAAAH!
s09_e23_c22_u510	(to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?
s09_e23_c22_u511	(looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
s09_e23_c22_u512	I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
s09_e23_c22_u513	C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
s09_e23_c22_u514	Oh, damn it!
s09_e23_c22_u515	(pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!
s09_e23_c22_u516	(boasting) Game, point!
s09_e23_c22_u517	(threatening) Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
s09_e23_c22_u518	You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.
s09_e23_c22_u519	NO, NO, NOOO!
s09_e23_c22_u520	And that's how it's done! (Phoebe kisses him)
s09_e23_c22_u521	Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
s09_e23_c22_u522	Best out of three?
s09_e23_c22_u523	That's what I'm thinking.
s09_e23_c22_u524	Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
s09_e23_c22_u525	(to Mike) Serve the ball, chump!
s09_e23_c22_u526	(doing Monica and mumbling): Serve the ball, chump.
s09_e23_c22_u527	(to Mike) Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
s09_e23_c23_u528	I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be (pause) just nifty!
s09_e23_c23_u529	Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)
s09_e23_c23_u530	Jarvis?
s09_e23_c23_u531	(seeing her) Oh, you're back... (to Ross) this is my wife, Nancy.
s09_e23_c23_u532	Get Out!
s09_e23_c23_u533	Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
s09_e23_c23_u534	Yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So, what's going on?
s09_e23_c23_u535	Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
s09_e23_c23_u536	Oh my God, wh-what happened?
s09_e23_c23_u537	Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
s09_e23_c23_u538	I knew that was him!
s09_e23_c23_u539	Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
s09_e23_c23_u540	(holding her hand) Hey, you ok?
s09_e23_c23_u541	I guess. There was hum... (she breathes deeply) there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone (pause) else.
s09_e23_c23_u542	(merrily) Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
s09_e23_c23_u543	Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
s09_e23_c23_u544	Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
s09_e23_c23_u545	Or we could throw you both in now!
s09_e23_c23_u546	(standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)
s09_e23_c24_u547	Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
s09_e23_c24_u548	(exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!
s09_e23_c24_u549	No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
s09_e23_c24_u550	Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
s09_e23_c24_u551	I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
s09_e23_c24_u552	But...
s09_e23_c24_u553	Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
s09_e23_c24_u554	What about the obsessive cleaning?
s09_e23_c24_u555	That's just good sense!
s09_e23_c24_u556	(in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)
s09_e23_c24_u557	You ok?
s09_e23_c24_u558	No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!
s09_e23_c24_u559	So you forfeit?
s09_e23_c24_u560	Mike wins?
s09_e23_c24_u561	I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!
s09_e23_c24_u562	No, you didn't.
s09_e23_c24_u563	What?
s09_e23_c24_u564	Because I'm gonna play for ya.
s09_e23_c24_u565	You can't do that!
s09_e23_c24_u566	Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.
s09_e23_c24_u567	Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
s09_e23_c24_u568	(to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this.
s09_e23_c24_u569	(In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
s09_e23_c24_u570	But... you suck!
s09_e23_c24_u571	(Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart.
s09_e23_c24_u572	All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
s09_e23_c24_u573	Ok!
s09_e23_c24_u574	Oh my God! You're good!
s09_e23_c24_u575	It's like watching porn!
s09_e23_c24_u576	And that's... how... it's done!
s09_e23_c24_u577	(to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike) loser! (back to Chandler) When did you stop sucking?
s09_e23_c24_u578	I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
s09_e23_c24_u579	Why?
s09_e23_c24_u580	I don't know.
s09_e23_c24_u581	This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
s09_e23_c24_u582	That's why!
s09_e23_c25_u583	Thanks!
s09_e23_c25_u584	Hi.
s09_e23_c25_u585	Are they still looking for us?
s09_e23_c25_u586	Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
s09_e23_c25_u587	I don't think they saw us.
s09_e23_c25_u588	I don't think they did.
s09_e23_c25_u589	Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... (pause) There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
s09_e23_c25_u590	(apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
s09_e23_c25_u591	I think you know.
s09_e23_c25_u592	I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
s09_e23_c25_u593	I'm sorry... we... we can't.
s09_e23_c25_u594	All right, all right.
s09_e23_c25_u595	I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)
s09_e23_c25_u596	What?
s08_e04_c01_u001	Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
s08_e04_c01_u002	You're really sticking with the shell necklace huh? (Points to necklace of shells he's wearing.)
s08_e04_c01_u003	Hi!
s08_e04_c01_u004	Hey! You're back! (Hugs and kisses all around.)
s08_e04_c01_u005	Hi sweetie!
s08_e04_c01_u006	Come on in!
s08_e04_c01_u007	So how was the honeymoon?
s08_e04_c01_u008	Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.
s08_e04_c01_u009	That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.
s08_e04_c01_u010	No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
s08_e04_c01_u011	They're terrific, and they live right here in the city.
s08_e04_c01_u012	Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
s08_e04_c01_u013	I'm sorry, we're just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
s08_e04_c01_u014	I know.
s08_e04_c01_u015	A couple? Like two people? Like (points to himself) one (points to Phoebe), two people?
s08_e04_c01_u016	This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
s08_e04_c01_u017	Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg, I'm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
s08_e04_c01_u018	Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance
s08_e04_c01_u019	Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
s08_e04_c01_u020	We really-didn't get a chance to
s08_e04_c01_u021	You have got to be kidding me!
s08_e04_c01_u022	We didn't get anything for anyone.
s08_e04_c01_u023	Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
s08_e04_c01_u024	That you can have.
s08_e04_c02_u025	Hi!
s08_e04_c02_u026	Hello!
s08_e04_c02_u027	Welcome home.
s08_e04_c02_u028	So, how was the honeymoon?
s08_e04_c02_u029	It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
s08_e04_c02_u030	Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
s08_e04_c02_u031	Oh great! (Shows them the picture.)
s08_e04_c02_u032	Ross! It's got your wavy black lines!
s08_e04_c02_u033	All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y'know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
s08_e04_c02_u034	Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
s08_e04_c02_u035	Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
s08_e04_c02_u036	You're welcome buddy.
s08_e04_c02_u037	(glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)
s08_e04_c02_u038	And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
s08_e04_c02_u039	(laughs) Umm that's-that's a little misleading.
s08_e04_c02_u040	What is?
s08_e04_c02_u041	The lie you just told.
s08_e04_c02_u042	That-that you came on to me?
s08_e04_c02_u043	There's the one!
s08_e04_c02_u044	But you did! I mean, let's be honest.
s08_e04_c02_u045	Yes let's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.
s08_e04_c02_u046	Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) That's right.
s08_e04_c02_u047	You know you kissed me first.
s08_e04_c02_u048	What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
s08_e04_c02_u049	I was sending you signals?
s08_e04_c02_u050	Yeah!
s08_e04_c02_u051	Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)
s08_e04_c02_u052	Y'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
s08_e04_c02_u053	Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?
s08_e04_c02_u054	Y'know what? Y'know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
s08_e04_c02_u055	No please, show me how I begged you!
s08_e04_c02_u056	I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It's an expression.
s08_e04_c03_u057	I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex!
s08_e04_c03_u058	Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
s08_e04_c03_u059	Y'know who has a great video camera?
s08_e04_c03_u060	(nasally) Greg and Jenny?
s08_e04_c03_u061	Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em.
s08_e04_c03_u062	Let's call em.
s08_e04_c03_u063	Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
s08_e04_c03_u064	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?
s08_e04_c03_u065	Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place.
s08_e04_c03_u066	(on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)
s08_e04_c03_u067	Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)
s08_e04_c03_u068	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) It's the deli again!
s08_e04_c03_u069	All right! I'll have a sandwich!
s08_e04_c03_u070	(hangs up) I don't think this number's right!
s08_e04_c03_u071	What?
s08_e04_c03_u072	You got fake numbered.
s08_e04_c03_u073	What?! People don't do that!
s08_e04_c03_u074	Oh I think we do.
s08_e04_c03_u075	They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
s08_e04_c03_u076	I don't know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
s08_e04_c03_u077	And you've never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
s08_e04_c03_u078	Y'know what? Don't worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
s08_e04_c03_u079	Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
s08_e04_c03_u080	(entering) Rachel won't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
s08_e04_c03_u081	Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
s08_e04_c03_u082	Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
s08_e04_c03_u083	That's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
s08_e04_c03_u084	Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
s08_e04_c03_u085	Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
s08_e04_c03_u086	About-about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadn't had sex in months?
s08_e04_c03_u087	(laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
s08_e04_c04_u088	Hey!
s08_e04_c04_u089	Hey.
s08_e04_c04_u090	Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.
s08_e04_c04_u091	Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
s08_e04_c04_u092	I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.
s08_e04_c04_u093	Whoa, for like months?
s08_e04_c04_u094	Five to be lying, six.
s08_e04_c04_u095	Six months? Whoa that's rough.
s08_e04_c04_u096	Well, I mean it's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
s08_e04_c04_u097	The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
s08_e04_c04_u098	Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay-I'm scared for my health!
s08_e04_c04_u099	Okay. Okay. Umm-Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
s08_e04_c04_u100	Really? Well then tell it to me.
s08_e04_c04_u101	Okay. Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
s08_e04_c04_u102	(sarcastic) I'll try to control myself.
s08_e04_c04_u103	Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe
s08_e04_c04_u104	(laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?
s08_e04_c04_u105	Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)
s08_e04_c04_u106	(stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?
s08_e04_c04_u107	I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly) And across the lake I saw-a beautiful woman-bathing herself-but she was crying
s08_e04_c04_u108	(intently listening) Why?
s08_e04_c05_u109	Umm, this is great wine.
s08_e04_c05_u110	It's from France-In Europe-Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
s08_e04_c05_u111	Really?
s08_e04_c05_u112	Uh-hmm-Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
s08_e04_c05_u113	I studied for a year in Barcelona. (Ross is stunned and worried.)
s08_e04_c05_u114	Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
s08_e04_c05_u115	I love hiking!
s08_e04_c05_u116	(whines) Oh that's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo
s08_e04_c05_u117	I think its Tibidabo.
s08_e04_c05_u118	Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
s08_e04_c06_u119	Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
s08_e04_c06_u120	Great! I'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
s08_e04_c06_u121	Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it.
s08_e04_c06_u122	No! No, I don't-don't want to.
s08_e04_c06_u123	How long since you've seen a girl naked?
s08_e04_c06_u124	I was backpacking across Western Europe.
s08_e04_c06_u125	I'm not feeling it.
s08_e04_c06_u126	I was just outside Barcelona, hiking
s08_e04_c06_u127	No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
s08_e04_c06_u128	It's been six months! I'm always hot!
s08_e04_c06_u129	Well you're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong.
s08_e04_c06_u130	I'll try that.
s08_e04_c06_u131	All right now- All right, you're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right?
s08_e04_c06_u132	Thanks.
s08_e04_c06_u133	Good luck.
s08_e04_c06_u134	Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
s08_e04_c06_u135	Yeah?
s08_e04_c06_u136	Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I'll help you out.
s08_e04_c06_u137	(trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)
s08_e04_c06_u138	Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? (Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!
s08_e04_c06_u139	Oh Ross!
s08_e04_c06_u140	Hi!
s08_e04_c06_u141	Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
s08_e04_c06_u142	That's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
s08_e04_c06_u143	(voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.
s08_e04_c06_u144	Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)
s08_e04_c06_u145	Yeah, definitely.
s08_e04_c06_u146	What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
s08_e04_c06_u147	Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
s08_e04_c06_u148	Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "You'll show me right?") No!
s08_e04_c06_u149	You're right. (Mouths, "I know you'll show me, right?)
s08_e04_c06_u150	Joey! No!
s08_e04_c06_u151	Loud and clear! (Mouths, "You'll show me," and nods.)
s08_e04_c07_u152	I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
s08_e04_c07_u153	Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.
s08_e04_c07_u154	Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.
s08_e04_c07_u155	Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
s08_e04_c07_u156	Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)
s08_e04_c07_u157	I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.
s08_e04_c07_u158	I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
s08_e04_c07_u159	I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
s08_e04_c07_u160	(rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)
s08_e04_c07_u161	Well maybe it was all of your questions.
s08_e04_c07_u162	What about my questions?
s08_e04_c07_u163	The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
s08_e04_c07_u164	Oh, I'm sorry. Was that another joke?
s08_e04_c07_u165	(angrily) Was that another question?
s08_e04_c07_u166	(entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?
s08_e04_c07_u167	Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
s08_e04_c07_u168	Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
s08_e04_c07_u169	Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)
s08_e04_c07_u170	Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You don't want to see this do you?
s08_e04_c07_u171	Hell yeah!!!
s08_e04_c07_u172	I am not gonna show you this!
s08_e04_c07_u173	No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
s08_e04_c07_u174	Forget it, she's destroying it.
s08_e04_c07_u175	Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
s08_e04_c07_u176	Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
s08_e04_c07_u177	I wanna see it.
s08_e04_c07_u178	What?!
s08_e04_c07_u179	Clearly you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
s08_e04_c07_u180	(confused) Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
s08_e04_c07_u181	I don't want people to see it for your sake.
s08_e04_c07_u182	Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)
s08_e04_c07_u183	Rachel, please
s08_e04_c07_u184	Ah, a little preview!
s08_e04_c07_u185	Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I'm gonna be saying-(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)
s08_e04_c07_u186	Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)
s08_e04_c07_u187	(on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?
s08_e04_c07_u188	(To Phoebe) I'm so happy!
s08_e04_c08_u189	(on tape) Oh, thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
s08_e04_c08_u190	There I am.
s08_e04_c08_u191	You're gonna get pregnant.
s08_e04_c08_u192	(on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I
s08_e04_c08_u193	(on tape) You didn't do it?
s08_e04_c08_u194	(on tape) I-I know-I had put them in-in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.
s08_e04_c08_u195	(taking Rachel's hand) Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
s08_e04_c08_u196	Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
s08_e04_c08_u197	I know.
s08_e04_c08_u198	(on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica) "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" (She tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh
s08_e04_c08_u199	Did you do it on our invitations?!
s08_e04_c08_u200	(pause) Not on the ones we sent out.
s08_e04_c08_u201	So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)
s08_e04_c08_u202	(on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
s08_e04_c08_u203	(on tape) I know. Hey remember-remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost
s08_e04_c08_u204	(on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?
s08_e04_c08_u205	(on tape) I mean I-I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
s08_e04_c08_u206	(on tape) Oh I wanted to.
s08_e04_c08_u207	(on tape) So we-we both wanted to.
s08_e04_c08_u208	(on tape) Interesting.
s08_e04_c08_u209	(on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
s08_e04_c08_u210	(on tape) Oh yeah, sure.
s08_e04_c08_u211	Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me.
s08_e04_c08_u212	And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.
s08_e04_c08_u213	(on tape) Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
s08_e04_c08_u214	Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!
s08_e04_c08_u215	Oh, you came on to Ross!
s08_e04_c08_u216	What?!
s08_e04_c08_u217	Now I'm so happy.
s08_e04_c08_u218	What are you talking about?!
s08_e04_c08_u219	You used the Europe story!
s08_e04_c08_u220	That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
s08_e04_c08_u221	How do you know about that story?!
s08_e04_c08_u222	How do you know about that story?!
s08_e04_c08_u223	I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
s08_e04_c08_u224	(raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)
s08_e04_c08_u225	No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
s08_e04_c08_u226	(raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!
s08_e04_c09_u227	Hi.
s08_e04_c09_u228	So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
s08_e04_c09_u229	Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
s08_e04_c09_u230	It was an amazing night.
s08_e04_c09_u231	It was. It was an amazing night.
s08_e04_c09_u232	You think it looked amazing?
s08_e04_c09_u233	I uh- I don't know. I mean I-I honestly didn't watch it.
s08_e04_c09_u234	Yeah, me neither. Yet
s08_e04_c09_u235	Uhhhhhh-that-that may be weird.
s08_e04_c09_u236	Yeah, it would be really weird.
s08_e04_c09_u237	Good luck.
s08_e04_c09_u238	Good luck to you.
s08_e04_c09_u239	Mind if I mute?
s08_e04_c09_u240	Oh please. (He does so.)
s08_e04_c09_u241	Oh, oh there go the clothes.
s08_e04_c09_u242	You are undressing very quickly.
s08_e04_c09_u243	Six months Rachel, six months.
s08_e04_c09_u244	Hey. We-we look-we look pretty good.
s08_e04_c09_u245	That's what I was gonna say.
s08_e04_c09_u246	Oh nice tan!
s08_e04_c09_u247	Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
s08_e04_c09_u248	Ah-.
s08_e04_c09_u249	Have you been working out?
s08_e04_c09_u250	I have been working out.
s08_e04_c09_u251	Really? Wow, this is so much better than I
s08_e04_c09_u252	Oh that's not pretty.
s08_e04_c09_u253	Oh! Oh!
s08_e04_c09_u254	No!
s08_e04_c09_u255	Oh God!
s08_e04_c09_u256	Oh no!
s08_e04_c09_u257	Oh, make it stop!
s08_e04_c09_u258	Oh no!!
s08_e04_c09_u259	Make it stop!!
s08_e04_c09_u260	No!!
s08_e04_c09_u261	Have to make it stop!!
s08_e04_c09_u262	No!!!
s08_e04_c10_u263	(on phone) Hello Greg? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5- (Listens) (To Chandler) That is their old number! Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!
s08_e04_c10_u264	Jenny! That is so Jenny!
s08_e04_c10_u265	(on phone) Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? (Listens) Okay, how about Sunday? (Listens) Okay umm, the week after that? (Listens) The week after that? (Listens) Y'know what Greg? Y'know what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny can't see that then- (Listens) January 15th? (Chandler dances.) We'll see you then! (Listens) Okay!
s09_e22_c01_u001	(while Joey's giving her a massage) Oh! That feels sooo good!
s09_e22_c01_u002	(speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
s09_e22_c01_u003	I'm sorry, what?
s09_e22_c01_u004	Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
s09_e22_c01_u005	From... Cosmo??
s09_e22_c01_u006	Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
s09_e22_c01_u007	(to Joey) So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!
s09_e22_c01_u008	So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
s09_e22_c01_u009	(hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
s09_e22_c01_u010	Oh hey Rach!
s09_e22_c01_u011	Yeah...
s09_e22_c01_u012	Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
s09_e22_c01_u013	Oh, well...
s09_e22_c01_u014	I'm sure you have better things to do.
s09_e22_c01_u015	Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
s09_e22_c01_u016	If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.
s09_e22_c01_u017	Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
s09_e22_c01_u018	(to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
s09_e22_c01_u019	(entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?
s09_e22_c01_u020	What's the matter, Pheebs?
s09_e22_c01_u021	Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
s09_e22_c01_u022	Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
s09_e22_c01_u023	Exactly!
s09_e22_c01_u024	And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
s09_e22_c01_u025	(after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!!
s09_e22_c01_u026	Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
s09_e22_c01_u027	Ok, that'll be great!
s09_e22_c01_u028	Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
s09_e22_c01_u029	That's not what we're gonna do!
s09_e22_c01_u030	Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
s09_e22_c02_u031	(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
s09_e22_c02_u032	Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
s09_e22_c02_u033	Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
s09_e22_c02_u034	(entering) Hi there.
s09_e22_c02_u035	Hi.
s09_e22_c02_u036	Hi.
s09_e22_c02_u037	I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
s09_e22_c02_u038	Ok.
s09_e22_c02_u039	Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
s09_e22_c02_u040	Oh, DAMN IT!
s09_e22_c02_u041	Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
s09_e22_c02_u042	Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
s09_e22_c02_u043	(long pause) Ok.
s09_e22_c02_u044	And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
s09_e22_c02_u045	Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
s09_e22_c03_u046	Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
s09_e22_c03_u047	Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
s09_e22_c03_u048	(to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)
s09_e22_c03_u049	Not gonna find any clothes in there!
s09_e22_c03_u050	(entering) Hey, you guys!
s09_e22_c03_u051	Hi.
s09_e22_c03_u052	Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
s09_e22_c03_u053	Umh... Kurts Baley?
s09_e22_c03_u054	Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?
s09_e22_c03_u055	Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
s09_e22_c03_u056	So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
s09_e22_c03_u057	Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
s09_e22_c03_u058	He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
s09_e22_c03_u059	Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
s09_e22_c03_u060	Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?
s09_e22_c03_u061	Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
s09_e22_c03_u062	(entering) Hey guys!
s09_e22_c03_u063	Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
s09_e22_c03_u064	I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
s09_e22_c03_u065	It's in Barbados.
s09_e22_c03_u066	But you come first!
s09_e22_c03_u067	I'm there!
s09_e22_c03_u068	We'll see you, guys! (she goes)
s09_e22_c03_u069	Bye.
s09_e22_c03_u070	Bye, see ya. (she goes)
s09_e22_c03_u071	(sitting down on the couch) Ok.
s09_e22_c03_u072	All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
s09_e22_c03_u073	Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
s09_e22_c03_u074	So-so what did the doctor say?
s09_e22_c03_u075	Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
s09_e22_c03_u076	So you're ruling out surrogacy?
s09_e22_c03_u077	Yeah.
s09_e22_c03_u078	So, I don't have to learn what that means?
s09_e22_c03_u079	Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
s09_e22_c03_u080	Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
s09_e22_c03_u081	(stopping Joey) ah-ha!
s09_e22_c03_u082	How do you feel about all this?
s09_e22_c03_u083	I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
s09_e22_c03_u084	Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
s09_e22_c03_u085	(puzzled) What?
s09_e22_c03_u086	(looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
s09_e22_c04_u087	The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
s09_e22_c04_u088	Mmm-mm.
s09_e22_c04_u089	(reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!
s09_e22_c04_u090	Oh, that's not what you want...
s09_e22_c05_u091	(to a girl) Incentive For Men?
s09_e22_c05_u092	Oh, I'll take some of that.
s09_e22_c05_u093	Pheebs, that's for men!
s09_e22_c05_u094	No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.
s09_e22_c05_u095	Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
s09_e22_c05_u096	(to Rachel) So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?
s09_e22_c05_u097	On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
s09_e22_c05_u098	See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out.
s09_e22_c05_u099	Really?
s09_e22_c05_u100	Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?
s09_e22_c05_u101	Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
s09_e22_c05_u102	You've seen all the movies...
s09_e22_c05_u103	Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
s09_e22_c05_u104	(picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
s09_e22_c05_u105	Sure!
s09_e22_c05_u106	Ok!
s09_e22_c05_u107	Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
s09_e22_c05_u108	You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
s09_e22_c05_u109	So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
s09_e22_c05_u110	She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
s09_e22_c05_u111	Why?
s09_e22_c05_u112	I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
s09_e22_c05_u113	Who else?
s09_e22_c05_u114	Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
s09_e22_c05_u115	You like Joey?
s09_e22_c05_u116	Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
s09_e22_c05_u117	(whispering) Oh my God!
s09_e22_c05_u118	It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
s09_e22_c05_u119	Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
s09_e22_c05_u120	(annoyed) Oh, I get it!
s09_e22_c05_u121	Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
s09_e22_c05_u122	I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
s09_e22_c05_u123	Yeah.
s09_e22_c05_u124	So can we keep this between us?
s09_e22_c05_u125	Sure!
s09_e22_c05_u126	Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
s09_e22_c05_u127	Oh.
s09_e22_c05_u128	Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
s09_e22_c06_u129	Hi honey!
s09_e22_c06_u130	Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
s09_e22_c06_u131	Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!
s09_e22_c06_u132	(shaking Monica's hand) You too.
s09_e22_c06_u133	You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
s09_e22_c06_u134	I got it.
s09_e22_c06_u135	Thanks.
s09_e22_c06_u136	(to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
s09_e22_c06_u137	Yeah, I guess.
s09_e22_c06_u138	So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
s09_e22_c06_u139	(turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?
s09_e22_c06_u140	Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
s09_e22_c06_u141	Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!
s09_e22_c06_u142	No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
s09_e22_c06_u143	Chandler!
s09_e22_c06_u144	I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
s09_e22_c06_u145	I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
s09_e22_c06_u146	Ok!
s09_e22_c06_u147	Uh!
s09_e22_c06_u148	(bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!
s09_e22_c06_u149	Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
s09_e22_c06_u150	Tell me about yourself, Zack!
s09_e22_c07_u151	Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
s09_e22_c07_u152	Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
s09_e22_c07_u153	Ok, great!
s09_e22_c07_u154	Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
s09_e22_c07_u155	(sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!
s09_e22_c07_u156	(sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!
s09_e22_c07_u157	(goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
s09_e22_c07_u158	(comes out again) What!?
s09_e22_c07_u159	(comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
s09_e22_c07_u160	Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
s09_e22_c07_u161	Ooh! We have a problem.
s09_e22_c07_u162	Oh! What are we gonna do?
s09_e22_c07_u163	Just be honest with her.
s09_e22_c07_u164	Oh my God!
s09_e22_c07_u165	And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
s09_e22_c07_u166	(yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!
s09_e22_c08_u167	Hello?
s09_e22_c08_u168	Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
s09_e22_c08_u169	No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
s09_e22_c08_u170	I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
s09_e22_c08_u171	Oh! How's it going?
s09_e22_c08_u172	It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
s09_e22_c08_u173	What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
s09_e22_c08_u174	Barbados.
s09_e22_c08_u175	Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!
s09_e22_c08_u176	What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
s09_e22_c08_u177	Well, just wake him up!
s09_e22_c08_u178	I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
s09_e22_c08_u179	Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
s09_e22_c09_u180	Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
s09_e22_c09_u181	Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. (Chandler points him the bathroom) Thanks!
s09_e22_c09_u182	So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
s09_e22_c09_u183	Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
s09_e22_c09_u184	You don't like him.
s09_e22_c09_u185	I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
s09_e22_c09_u186	Alright! Just follow my lead!
s09_e22_c09_u187	You guys have such a great place here.
s09_e22_c09_u188	Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
s09_e22_c09_u189	Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.
s09_e22_c09_u190	(very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
s09_e22_c09_u191	(looking very puzzled) Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
s09_e22_c09_u192	Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
s09_e22_c09_u193	(after a pause, very confused) No...
s09_e22_c09_u194	Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?
s09_e22_c09_u195	You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
s09_e22_c09_u196	We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
s09_e22_c09_u197	Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
s09_e22_c09_u198	You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an "ok" sign)
s09_e22_c09_u199	Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
s09_e22_c09_u200	Monica & Chandler: Sure! Alright...
s09_e22_c09_u201	Ravioli's delicious!
s09_e22_c09_u202	I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
s09_e22_c09_u203	No I didn't.
s09_e22_c09_u204	Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)
s09_e22_c09_u205	(Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!
s09_e22_c10_u206	Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
s09_e22_c10_u207	Good plan.
s09_e22_c10_u208	Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?
s09_e22_c10_u209	Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"! (at which she walks away)
s09_e22_c10_u210	(to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?
s09_e22_c10_u211	Oh! trying on clothes.
s09_e22_c10_u212	(pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
s09_e22_c10_u213	(smiling) Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
s09_e22_c10_u214	Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.
s09_e22_c10_u215	No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
s09_e22_c10_u216	(after a pause) Yeah.
s09_e22_c10_u217	It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?
s09_e22_c10_u218	Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
s09_e22_c10_u219	Wow!
s09_e22_c10_u220	Yeah...
s09_e22_c10_u221	You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.
s09_e22_c10_u222	(Looks ashamed) I try...
s09_e22_c11_u223	(To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
s09_e22_c11_u224	(confused) You're welcome. (Ross hugs him again)
s09_e22_c12_u225	(impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
s09_e22_c12_u226	Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
s09_e22_c12_u227	Then don't go!
s09_e22_c12_u228	Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
s09_e22_c12_u229	Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
s09_e22_c12_u230	You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
s09_e22_c13_u231	David?
s09_e22_c13_u232	Phoebe! Hi!
s09_e22_c13_u233	Oh my God! (they hug)
s09_e22_c13_u234	Wow, you look unbelievable.
s09_e22_c13_u235	Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
s09_e22_c13_u236	Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
s09_e22_c13_u237	What happened?
s09_e22_c13_u238	Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
s09_e22_c13_u239	Yeah?
s09_e22_c13_u240	Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
s09_e22_c13_u241	Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?
s09_e22_c13_u242	Good, good, life is good...
s09_e22_c13_u243	Good!
s09_e22_c13_u244	Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
s09_e22_c13_u245	(disappointed) Oh, good for you.
s09_e22_c13_u246	She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
s09_e22_c13_u247	Mike and I broke up.
s09_e22_c13_u248	You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
s09_e22_c13_u249	Really?
s09_e22_c13_u250	Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
s09_e22_c13_u251	I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
s09_e22_c13_u252	Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
s09_e22_c13_u253	Well... (pause) no.
s09_e22_c13_u254	Do you wanna get a drink?
s09_e22_c13_u255	I'd love to.
s09_e22_c13_u256	Great.
s09_e22_c13_u257	Ok. (they walk away together)
s09_e22_c13_u258	Do you smell beets?
s09_e22_c13_u259	Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
s09_e22_c13_u260	Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
s09_e22_c13_u261	No, that's David.
s09_e22_c13_u262	There's a third guy?
s09_e22_c13_u263	(disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.
s09_e22_c13_u264	I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
s09_e22_c13_u265	You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
s09_e22_c13_u266	No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.
s09_e22_c13_u267	Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
s09_e22_c13_u268	No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.
s09_e22_c13_u269	Ok.
s09_e22_c13_u270	I think we've found our sperm!
s09_e22_c13_u271	Does seem pretty perfect.
s09_e22_c13_u272	Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
s09_e22_c13_u273	(pause) No.
s09_e22_c13_u274	Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
s09_e22_c13_u275	No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
s09_e22_c13_u276	Yeah, he's better!
s09_e22_c13_u277	No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
s09_e22_c13_u278	Really? Are you sure?
s09_e22_c13_u279	Yeah, I'm sure.
s09_e22_c13_u280	(sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
s09_e22_c13_u281	That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)
s09_e22_c13_u282	So you know this leaves us with...
s09_e22_c13_u283	Adoption.
s09_e22_c13_u284	How do you feel about that?
s09_e22_c13_u285	I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
s09_e22_c13_u286	Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
s09_e22_c13_u287	So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
s09_e22_c13_u288	(smiling) Yeah.
s09_e22_c13_u289	(excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
s09_e22_c13_u290	We are gonna be great parents.
s09_e22_c13_u291	And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived.
s09_e22_c13_u292	Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
s09_e22_c14_u293	Hey, Zack!
s09_e22_c14_u294	(hardly enthusiastic) Hey Chandler.
s09_e22_c14_u295	Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
s09_e22_c14_u296	No you didn't.
s09_e22_c14_u297	Really?
s09_e22_c14_u298	No you did.
s09_e22_c14_u299	My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
s09_e22_c14_u300	(to Zack) Here are the boards for Friday's pitch (hands him something).
s09_e22_c14_u301	Oh, thank you.
s09_e22_c14_u302	You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
s03_e03_c01_u001	(from bedroom) WHOAA!!
s03_e03_c01_u002	(going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
s03_e03_c02_u003	Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
s03_e03_c02_u004	Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
s03_e03_c02_u005	Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
s03_e03_c02_u006	I didn't know there were docks.
s03_e03_c02_u007	Hey.
s03_e03_c02_u008	Hey.
s03_e03_c02_u009	Aww, is it broken?
s03_e03_c02_u010	No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is wearing)
s03_e03_c02_u011	Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
s03_e03_c02_u012	Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
s03_e03_c02_u013	Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
s03_e03_c02_u014	What is this? Fruit?
s03_e03_c02_u015	Monica's making jam.
s03_e03_c02_u016	Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
s03_e03_c02_u017	Because the kids need new shoes.
s03_e03_c02_u018	I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)
s03_e03_c02_u019	This will just be my batch.
s03_e03_c03_u020	(turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
s03_e03_c03_u021	You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
s03_e03_c03_u022	What?
s03_e03_c03_u023	One more chance Ursula, please?
s03_e03_c03_u024	Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
s03_e03_c03_u025	Wh..
s03_e03_c03_u026	Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
s03_e03_c03_u027	Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
s03_e03_c03_u028	Oh, you're not a dingus.
s03_e03_c03_u029	I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
s03_e03_c03_u030	Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
s03_e03_c03_u031	Well thanks. (starts to leave)
s03_e03_c03_u032	Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
s03_e03_c03_u033	Not really.
s03_e03_c03_u034	Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
s03_e03_c03_u035	Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)
s03_e03_c03_u036	Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
s03_e03_c03_u037	Yeah, okay.
s03_e03_c03_u038	Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
s03_e03_c03_u039	Sorry.
s03_e03_c04_u040	Mon?
s03_e03_c04_u041	Mon?
s03_e03_c04_u042	(reading) 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
s03_e03_c04_u043	Wait a minute, look.
s03_e03_c04_u044	What?
s03_e03_c04_u045	Look, look, look.
s03_e03_c04_u046	What, what, what?
s03_e03_c04_u047	It's an empty apartment.
s03_e03_c04_u048	Oooh.
s03_e03_c04_u049	We're all alone in an empty apartment.
s03_e03_c04_u050	Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. (they fall onto the couch)
s03_e03_c04_u051	There it is.
s03_e03_c04_u052	Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.
s03_e03_c04_u053	Hey.
s03_e03_c04_u054	Do I look fat?
s03_e03_c04_u055	Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
s03_e03_c04_u056	Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
s03_e03_c04_u057	Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
s03_e03_c04_u058	Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
s03_e03_c04_u059	Nooo!
s03_e03_c04_u060	And it works both ways.
s03_e03_c04_u061	Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
s03_e03_c04_u062	Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
s03_e03_c04_u063	Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
s03_e03_c04_u064	That's easy, baggage claim.
s03_e03_c04_u065	(buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
s03_e03_c04_u066	Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
s03_e03_c04_u067	Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.
s03_e03_c04_u068	Oh.
s03_e03_c04_u069	All right are you guys gonna come down?
s03_e03_c04_u070	Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
s03_e03_c04_u071	Good luck Chandler.
s03_e03_c04_u072	Thank you Rachel.
s03_e03_c04_u073	Bye sweetie.
s03_e03_c04_u074	Bye hon.
s03_e03_c04_u075	(blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
s03_e03_c04_u076	Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
s03_e03_c04_u077	Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...
s03_e03_c04_u078	Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
s03_e03_c04_u079	I'm gonna use the cushion.
s03_e03_c04_u080	Yeah.
s03_e03_c04_u081	Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
s03_e03_c04_u082	Okay, the old hug and roll.
s03_e03_c04_u083	Yep.
s03_e03_c04_u084	Okay, one question.
s03_e03_c04_u085	Shoot.
s03_e03_c04_u086	You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
s03_e03_c05_u087	Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
s03_e03_c05_u088	(Looks at him) You're so pretty.
s03_e03_c05_u089	(entering) Hi!
s03_e03_c05_u090	Hey, Phoebe.
s03_e03_c05_u091	Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
s03_e03_c05_u092	(with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?
s03_e03_c05_u093	Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
s03_e03_c05_u094	Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
s03_e03_c05_u095	Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
s03_e03_c05_u096	Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
s03_e03_c05_u097	No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
s03_e03_c05_u098	(with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)
s03_e03_c05_u099	Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
s03_e03_c05_u100	(entering) Hey guys.
s03_e03_c05_u101	Hey Mon.
s03_e03_c05_u102	Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.
s03_e03_c05_u103	Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!
s03_e03_c05_u104	Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
s03_e03_c05_u105	Put your hands together.
s03_e03_c05_u106	Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
s03_e03_c05_u107	No more jam?!
s03_e03_c05_u108	Well, what happened to your jam plan?
s03_e03_c05_u109	I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
s03_e03_c05_u110	Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
s03_e03_c05_u111	What are you talking about?
s03_e03_c05_u112	I'm talking about me having a baby.
s03_e03_c05_u113	What?
s03_e03_c05_u114	Are you serious?
s03_e03_c05_u115	Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
s03_e03_c05_u116	Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
s03_e03_c05_u117	It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
s03_e03_c05_u118	That, that's what's stupid.
s03_e03_c05_u119	I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
s03_e03_c05_u120	Down at the docks again?
s03_e03_c06_u121	Night-night Bing-a-ling.
s03_e03_c06_u122	Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
s03_e03_c07_u123	Here's my binoculars.
s03_e03_c07_u124	Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
s03_e03_c07_u125	These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
s03_e03_c07_u126	Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)
s03_e03_c07_u127	Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
s03_e03_c07_u128	Um, not even a little bit.
s03_e03_c07_u129	It's about you.
s03_e03_c07_u130	Oh, okay then.
s03_e03_c07_u131	(reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
s03_e03_c07_u132	Good. So what were you thinking?
s03_e03_c07_u133	I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
s03_e03_c07_u134	Really?
s03_e03_c07_u135	No.
s03_e03_c07_u136	Oh.
s03_e03_c07_u137	See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
s03_e03_c07_u138	Oh, okay. (he kisses her)
s03_e03_c08_u139	No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
s03_e03_c08_u140	(entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
s03_e03_c08_u141	You mean there's more than one of us.
s03_e03_c08_u142	Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
s03_e03_c08_u143	You're gonna what?
s03_e03_c08_u144	I'm gonna tell Mom.
s03_e03_c08_u145	Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
s03_e03_c08_u146	Crazy.
s03_e03_c08_u147	What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
s03_e03_c08_u148	(interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...
s03_e03_c08_u149	Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
s03_e03_c08_u150	Check it out!! Jam crackers!
s03_e03_c08_u151	Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'
s03_e03_c08_u152	Yeah, the Knicks rule!
s03_e03_c08_u153	Joey, this is you!
s03_e03_c08_u154	Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right.
s03_e03_c08_u155	When did you go to a sperm bank?
s03_e03_c08_u156	Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
s03_e03_c08_u157	And that's how you bought it?
s03_e03_c08_u158	Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
s03_e03_c08_u159	Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
s03_e03_c08_u160	Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
s03_e03_c08_u161	(entering) Hellooo!
s03_e03_c08_u162	Hey.
s03_e03_c08_u163	How's the maniac?
s03_e03_c08_u164	Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
s03_e03_c08_u165	Phoebe, what are you doing?
s03_e03_c08_u166	Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
s03_e03_c08_u167	Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
s03_e03_c08_u168	Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
s03_e03_c08_u169	You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
s03_e03_c08_u170	What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
s03_e03_c08_u171	Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
s03_e03_c08_u172	What are you saying I should do?
s03_e03_c08_u173	I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
s03_e03_c08_u174	Thank you, Monica.
s03_e03_c08_u175	Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
s03_e03_c08_u176	Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
s03_e03_c09_u177	Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)
s03_e03_c09_u178	Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
s03_e03_c09_u179	Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
s03_e03_c09_u180	Oh, (laughs) I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
s03_e03_c09_u181	(turns around, not amused) Ross's what?
s03_e03_c09_u182	You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
s03_e03_c10_u183	Phoebe?
s03_e03_c10_u184	Yes? Yes! Oh.
s03_e03_c10_u185	What are you doing?
s03_e03_c10_u186	Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)
s03_e03_c10_u187	Were you following me?
s03_e03_c10_u188	Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
s03_e03_c10_u189	So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. (Ursula walks past, and Malcom finds behind the pillar)
s03_e03_c10_u190	Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
s03_e03_c10_u191	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
s03_e03_c10_u192	No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
s03_e03_c10_u193	Uh-huh, I don't know.
s03_e03_c10_u194	Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
s03_e03_c11_u195	Hey.
s03_e03_c11_u196	Hey.
s03_e03_c11_u197	Where you going?
s03_e03_c11_u198	To the bank.
s03_e03_c11_u199	Sperm or regular?
s03_e03_c11_u200	Sperm.
s03_e03_c11_u201	So you're really doing this, huh?
s03_e03_c11_u202	Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
s03_e03_c11_u203	Sounds nice.
s03_e03_c11_u204	'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
s03_e03_c11_u205	No kiddin', hmm.
s03_e03_c11_u206	What?
s03_e03_c11_u207	No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
s03_e03_c11_u208	Really? Why?
s03_e03_c11_u209	I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.
s03_e03_c11_u210	Hoyt?
s03_e03_c11_u211	It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
s03_e03_c11_u212	Really, is he a swimmer?
s03_e03_c11_u213	He's got the body for it.
s03_e03_c11_u214	I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?
s03_e03_c11_u215	You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.
s03_e03_c11_u216	We do not have one of those signs.
s03_e03_c11_u217	Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
s03_e03_c11_u218	Two girls and a boy?
s03_e03_c11_u219	Yeah!
s03_e03_c11_u220	And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
s03_e03_c11_u221	Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good too.
s03_e03_c11_u222	Yeah.
s03_e03_c11_u223	Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for like a day. (hugs her again).
s03_e03_c12_u224	I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if they met me in person.
s03_e03_c12_u225	Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)
s03_e03_c12_u226	(wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?
s03_e03_c12_u227	Yeah.
s03_e03_c12_u228	(entering) Hello.
s03_e03_c12_u229	Hello.
s03_e03_c12_u230	(sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
s03_e03_c12_u231	Sure. What's up?
s03_e03_c12_u232	Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)
s05_e08_c01_u001	Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
s05_e08_c01_u002	I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
s05_e08_c01_u003	I need something sweet.
s05_e08_c01_u004	Does anyone wanna watch TV?
s05_e08_c01_u005	Yeah, sure.
s05_e08_c01_u006	Monica your remote doesn't work.
s05_e08_c01_u007	Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
s05_e08_c01_u008	Oh. Aw, forget it.
s05_e08_c01_u009	Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
s05_e08_c01_u010	Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
s05_e08_c01_u011	That's very nice.
s05_e08_c01_u012	That's sweet, Joey.
s05_e08_c01_u013	Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. (Note: Actually, I think every guy is thankful for thongs. That and spandex. J )
s05_e08_c02_u014	I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
s05_e08_c02_u015	Are you aware that you're still talking?
s05_e08_c02_u016	Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
s05_e08_c02_u017	Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
s05_e08_c02_u018	Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
s05_e08_c02_u019	I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
s05_e08_c02_u020	No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
s05_e08_c02_u021	Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
s05_e08_c02_u022	Oh God, no.
s05_e08_c02_u023	Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
s05_e08_c02_u024	It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
s05_e08_c03_u025	Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
s05_e08_c03_u026	More turkey Mr. Chandler? (And he makes eyes at him.)
s05_e08_c04_u027	You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
s05_e08_c04_u028	I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
s05_e08_c04_u029	Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
s05_e08_c04_u030	Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
s05_e08_c06_u031	In this life, Phoebe.
s05_e08_c06_u032	Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
s05_e08_c06_u033	Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
s05_e08_c06_u034	Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
s05_e08_c06_u035	I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
s05_e08_c06_u036	Oh, let's not tell this story.
s05_e08_c06_u037	Oh, come on!
s05_e08_c06_u038	Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
s05_e08_c06_u039	What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
s05_e08_c06_u040	Hey, it's not like it sounds.
s05_e08_c06_u041	It's exactly like it sounds.
s05_e08_c07_u042	(muffled) Hello?
s05_e08_c07_u043	(surprised) Hello?
s05_e08_c07_u044	Phoebe?
s05_e08_c07_u045	Joey? What's going on?
s05_e08_c07_u046	Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)
s05_e08_c07_u047	Oh my God!
s05_e08_c07_u048	I know! It's stuck!!!
s05_e08_c07_u049	(walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?
s05_e08_c07_u050	I put it on to scare Chandler!
s05_e08_c07_u051	Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
s05_e08_c07_u052	Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
s05_e08_c07_u053	Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
s05_e08_c07_u054	(entering) Hey!
s05_e08_c07_u055	Hey!
s05_e08_c07_u056	Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?
s05_e08_c07_u057	It's Joey.
s05_e08_c07_u058	What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
s05_e08_c07_u059	No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
s05_e08_c07_u060	Well, get it off now!
s05_e08_c07_u061	I can't! It-it's stuck!
s05_e08_c07_u062	Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
s05_e08_c07_u063	All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
s05_e08_c07_u064	Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!
s05_e08_c07_u065	Sorry! Sorry.
s05_e08_c07_u066	Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
s05_e08_c07_u067	Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
s05_e08_c07_u068	(pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
s05_e08_c07_u069	I'm over here big guy.
s05_e08_c07_u070	(turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are! (Starts dancing.) I scared you!
s05_e08_c08_u071	(laughing) You did look like an idiot.
s05_e08_c08_u072	Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
s05_e08_c08_u073	Yeah that's the same.
s05_e08_c08_u074	That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
s05_e08_c08_u075	Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
s05_e08_c08_u076	Which one?
s05_e08_c08_u077	Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
s05_e08_c08_u078	Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
s05_e08_c08_u079	Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
s05_e08_c09_u080	Monica! I think Rachel's here!
s05_e08_c09_u081	I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!
s05_e08_c09_u082	Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
s05_e08_c09_u083	Oh, why? Why? What happened?
s05_e08_c09_u084	Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over
s05_e08_c09_u085	Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
s05_e08_c09_u086	Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greets Monica's parents.) Hi!
s05_e08_c09_u087	Hi Rachel!
s05_e08_c09_u088	Happy Thanksgiving!
s05_e08_c09_u089	You too sweethart!
s05_e08_c09_u090	(entering) Hey!
s05_e08_c09_u091	Oh my!
s05_e08_c09_u092	Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
s05_e08_c09_u093	Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)
s05_e08_c09_u094	Oh, this is Monica.
s05_e08_c09_u095	Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
s05_e08_c09_u096	(seeing her) Okay.
s05_e08_c09_u097	I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
s05_e08_c09_u098	Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
s05_e08_c09_u099	Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
s05_e08_c09_u100	Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
s05_e08_c09_u101	Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
s05_e08_c09_u102	dammit! (Runs off.)
s05_e08_c09_u103	So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
s05_e08_c09_u104	Oh! No, not really.
s05_e08_c09_u105	Well, that's cool. So did- (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)
s05_e08_c09_u106	Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
s05_e08_c09_u107	I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
s05_e08_c09_u108	Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
s05_e08_c09_u109	Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
s05_e08_c09_u110	Call them mom and dad you loser!
s05_e08_c09_u111	(in a high pitched voice) Monica!
s05_e08_c09_u112	Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
s05_e08_c09_u113	Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
s05_e08_c09_u114	Okay!
s05_e08_c09_u115	Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
s05_e08_c09_u116	Oh that's so great!
s05_e08_c09_u117	I know!
s05_e08_c09_u118	Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
s05_e08_c09_u119	Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
s05_e08_c09_u120	I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
s05_e08_c09_u121	Big Nosed Rachel: I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
s05_e08_c09_u122	So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
s05_e08_c09_u123	Emotional Knapsack?
s05_e08_c09_u124	Yeah.
s05_e08_c09_u125	Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
s05_e08_c09_u126	Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
s05_e08_c09_u127	Dude, don't do that too me!
s05_e08_c09_u128	All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
s05_e08_c09_u129	No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
s05_e08_c09_u130	Hey!
s05_e08_c09_u131	(holding two pies) Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
s05_e08_c09_u132	No. No, thank you!
s05_e08_c09_u133	Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
s05_e08_c10_u134	I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
s05_e08_c10_u135	Well, I do.
s05_e08_c10_u136	I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
s05_e08_c10_u137	Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
s05_e08_c10_u138	I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
s05_e08_c10_u139	I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
s05_e08_c10_u140	Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
s05_e08_c10_u141	Yes, it was!
s05_e08_c10_u142	No, it wasn't. It was actually the
s05_e08_c10_u143	(interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
s05_e08_c10_u144	Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
s05_e08_c10_u145	We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
s05_e08_c10_u146	Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
s05_e08_c11_u147	So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
s05_e08_c11_u148	Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
s05_e08_c11_u149	(entering) Hi Rachel.
s05_e08_c11_u150	Oh hi!
s05_e08_c11_u151	Wow, love your new nose!
s05_e08_c11_u152	Jack.
s05_e08_c11_u153	What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see? (He starts to show her as the doorbell rings.)
s05_e08_c11_u154	I'll get it.
s05_e08_c11_u155	No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)
s05_e08_c11_u156	Hey!
s05_e08_c11_u157	Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving!
s05_e08_c11_u158	(To Chandler) God, your hair sure is different!
s05_e08_c11_u159	Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
s05_e08_c11_u160	So uh, where's Monica?
s05_e08_c11_u161	She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
s05_e08_c11_u162	Hi, Chandler.
s05_e08_c11_u163	Oh my God!
s05_e08_c11_u164	What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)
s05_e08_c11_u165	You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
s05_e08_c11_u166	Dude!
s05_e08_c11_u167	Sorry!
s05_e08_c11_u168	Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
s05_e08_c11_u169	Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
s05_e08_c11_u170	So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
s05_e08_c11_u171	Dude!
s05_e08_c11_u172	Sorry.
s05_e08_c11_u173	(entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
s05_e08_c11_u174	Well it didn't!
s05_e08_c11_u175	What?!
s05_e08_c11_u176	Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
s05_e08_c11_u177	Okay, that we may be able to do.
s05_e08_c11_u178	How?
s05_e08_c11_u179	Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
s05_e08_c11_u180	What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
s05_e08_c11_u181	Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
s05_e08_c11_u182	Yeah.
s05_e08_c11_u183	Yeah.
s05_e08_c11_u184	And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
s05_e08_c11_u185	Then, you will definitely get him back!
s05_e08_c11_u186	Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
s05_e08_c11_u187	Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
s05_e08_c11_u188	What do you mean?
s05_e08_c11_u189	Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
s05_e08_c11_u190	(excited) I can do that!
s05_e08_c11_u191	Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler) Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)
s05_e08_c11_u192	Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
s05_e08_c11_u193	Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
s05_e08_c11_u194	Okay.
s05_e08_c11_u195	Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)
s05_e08_c11_u196	Are you all right?
s05_e08_c11_u197	Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-(She drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)
s05_e08_c12_u198	What do we got here?
s05_e08_c12_u199	Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
s05_e08_c12_u200	Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
s05_e08_c12_u201	It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
s05_e08_c12_u202	Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
s05_e08_c12_u203	Did you bring the toe?
s05_e08_c12_u204	Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor.)
s05_e08_c12_u205	(opening it) Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and-(Stops suddenly.)
s05_e08_c12_u206	What?! What is it?
s05_e08_c12_u207	You brought a carrot.
s05_e08_c12_u208	What?
s05_e08_c12_u209	This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
s05_e08_c12_u210	You brought a carrot?!
s05_e08_c12_u211	Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
s05_e08_c12_u212	God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
s05_e08_c12_u213	It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
s05_e08_c12_u214	Without my toe?! I need my toe!
s05_e08_c12_u215	Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
s05_e08_c12_u216	Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
s05_e08_c13_u217	That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
s05_e08_c13_u218	I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
s05_e08_c13_u219	That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
s05_e08_c13_u220	I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
s05_e08_c13_u221	Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)
s05_e08_c13_u222	Chandler! (Follows him out.)
s05_e08_c13_u223	(To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
s05_e08_c13_u224	You're a dork.
s05_e08_c13_u225	I can't believe this.
s05_e08_c13_u226	Chandler, I said I was sorry.
s05_e08_c13_u227	Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
s05_e08_c13_u228	Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
s05_e08_c13_u229	Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)
s05_e08_c14_u230	Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
s05_e08_c14_u231	Nice try.
s05_e08_c14_u232	Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
s05_e08_c14_u233	Look, Monica
s05_e08_c14_u234	Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
s05_e08_c14_u235	This is not going to work.
s05_e08_c14_u236	I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
s05_e08_c14_u237	You are so great! I love you!
s05_e08_c14_u238	What?
s05_e08_c14_u239	Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
s05_e08_c14_u240	You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
s05_e08_c14_u241	No I didn't!
s05_e08_c14_u242	Yes, you did!
s05_e08_c14_u243	No I didn't!
s05_e08_c14_u244	You love me!
s05_e08_c14_u245	No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
s05_e23_c01_u001	Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
s05_e23_c01_u002	Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
s05_e23_c01_u003	No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
s05_e23_c01_u004	(smiles) Okay! (Goes to answer the phone.)
s05_e23_c01_u005	(under her breath) Sucker!
s05_e23_c01_u006	(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Joey!
s05_e23_c01_u007	Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?
s05_e23_c01_u008	Sure! Where is it?
s05_e23_c01_u009	Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
s05_e23_c01_u010	Ohh! So you're 5639?!
s05_e23_c01_u011	That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
s05_e23_c01_u012	(entering) Hey!
s05_e23_c01_u013	(to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
s05_e23_c01_u014	(To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!
s05_e23_c01_u015	No! (She nods no to Chandler) Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
s05_e23_c01_u016	Who was that?
s05_e23_c01_u017	Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
s05_e23_c01_u018	(To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
s05_e23_c01_u019	Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?
s05_e23_c01_u020	Yeah! (She hands the phone to Chandler.)
s05_e23_c01_u021	(To Joey) Hey!
s05_e23_c01_u022	Don't come out here!
s05_e23_c01_u023	No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
s05_e23_c01_u024	I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
s05_e23_c01_u025	Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
s05_e23_c01_u026	Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
s05_e23_c01_u027	Uh, what was that?
s05_e23_c01_u028	Uh, Entertainment Tonight. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that picture.)
s05_e23_c02_u029	Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica? (Goes into Monica's bedroom.)
s05_e23_c02_u030	(entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
s05_e23_c02_u031	(saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
s05_e23_c02_u032	Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
s05_e23_c02_u033	Which Richard?
s05_e23_c02_u034	The Richard.
s05_e23_c02_u035	Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
s05_e23_c02_u036	Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
s05_e23_c02_u037	Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
s05_e23_c02_u038	It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
s05_e23_c02_u039	That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
s05_e23_c02_u040	Really?
s05_e23_c02_u041	But again, Simmons. Go on.
s05_e23_c02_u042	The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
s05_e23_c02_u043	Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
s05_e23_c02_u044	Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
s05_e23_c02_u045	Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
s05_e23_c02_u046	I know.
s05_e23_c02_u047	Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
s05_e23_c02_u048	What?
s05_e23_c02_u049	On a totally different bet.
s05_e23_c02_u050	(entering) Hey!
s05_e23_c02_u051	It's almost our anniversary!
s05_e23_c02_u052	I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
s05_e23_c02_u053	Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
s05_e23_c02_u054	Huh.
s05_e23_c02_u055	I got you a present!
s05_e23_c02_u056	Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
s05_e23_c02_u057	I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)
s05_e23_c02_u058	Okay.
s05_e23_c02_u059	(grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
s05_e23_c02_u060	Wow!
s05_e23_c02_u061	For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
s05_e23_c02_u062	Do we have to?
s05_e23_c02_u063	No.
s05_e23_c02_u064	Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
s05_e23_c02_u065	Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
s05_e23_c02_u066	Yeah, I think we should see other people.
s05_e23_c02_u067	But we can go, right?
s05_e23_c02_u068	Yes.
s05_e23_c02_u069	Okay!
s05_e23_c02_u070	It's a great idea. (They kiss)
s05_e23_c02_u071	Okay, I'm gonna go too!
s05_e23_c02_u072	Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.
s05_e23_c02_u073	Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
s05_e23_c02_u074	Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
s05_e23_c02_u075	Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!
s05_e23_c02_u076	(entering with Ross) Hi!
s05_e23_c02_u077	Hey!
s05_e23_c02_u078	Hey!
s05_e23_c02_u079	Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
s05_e23_c02_u080	Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
s05_e23_c02_u081	Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
s05_e23_c02_u082	Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
s05_e23_c02_u083	Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
s05_e23_c02_u084	(coughing) Art lover!
s05_e23_c02_u085	What'd you say?
s05_e23_c02_u086	I said art lover.
s05_e23_c02_u087	Is that supposed to be an insult?
s05_e23_c02_u088	I don't know, I'm very tired.
s05_e23_c02_u089	So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
s05_e23_c02_u090	That sounds great.
s05_e23_c02_u091	Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)
s05_e23_c02_u092	Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
s05_e23_c02_u093	Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
s05_e23_c02_u094	No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
s05_e23_c02_u095	Naked alone time.
s05_e23_c02_u096	No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
s05_e23_c02_u097	Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
s05_e23_c03_u098	So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
s05_e23_c03_u099	So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
s05_e23_c03_u100	Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one from her purse.)
s05_e23_c03_u101	Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
s05_e23_c03_u102	Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. (Gets up and heads aft.)
s05_e23_c03_u103	(To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.
s05_e23_c03_u104	Aww! I love you!
s05_e23_c03_u105	Can I give you a present now?
s05_e23_c03_u106	Okay!
s05_e23_c03_u107	Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
s05_e23_c03_u108	I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
s05_e23_c03_u109	How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
s05_e23_c03_u110	Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
s05_e23_c03_u111	Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
s05_e23_c03_u112	(sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
s05_e23_c03_u113	What-what Richard thing?
s05_e23_c03_u114	Oh no. [The patented version.]
s05_e23_c03_u115	What Richard thing?
s05_e23_c03_u116	(To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!
s05_e23_c03_u117	Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
s05_e23_c03_u118	(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.
s05_e23_c03_u119	Really?!
s05_e23_c03_u120	Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)
s05_e23_c03_u121	Great!
s05_e23_c03_u122	Okay, London 1
s05_e23_c04_u123	(takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen-naked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)
s05_e23_c04_u124	(in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?
s05_e23_c04_u125	(singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! (There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's leaning against the door jam.)
s05_e23_c04_u126	Hey.
s05_e23_c05_u127	May I come in?
s05_e23_c05_u128	Uh, yeah, if you want too.
s05_e23_c05_u129	Do you want me too?
s05_e23_c05_u130	Yeah, sure?
s05_e23_c05_u131	So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.) This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us." (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)
s05_e23_c05_u132	And um, what-what is that Ross?
s05_e23_c05_u133	The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)
s05_e23_c05_u134	(laughs) What?! Are you crazy?
s05_e23_c05_u135	Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
s05_e23_c05_u136	(gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
s05_e23_c05_u137	You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
s05_e23_c05_u138	Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
s05_e23_c05_u139	No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other one and heads for the door.)
s05_e23_c05_u140	Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
s05_e23_c05_u141	Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
s05_e23_c05_u142	Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
s05_e23_c05_u143	Thank you.
s05_e23_c05_u144	Yes.
s05_e23_c05_u145	All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)
s05_e23_c05_u146	Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
s05_e23_c06_u147	Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
s05_e23_c06_u148	Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
s05_e23_c06_u149	For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!
s05_e23_c06_u150	Oh my God.
s05_e23_c06_u151	Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.) Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)
s05_e23_c06_u152	Hi!
s05_e23_c06_u153	Love your condoms my man.
s05_e23_c06_u154	What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
s05_e23_c06_u155	Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
s05_e23_c06_u156	Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
s05_e23_c06_u157	Who are you talking too?
s05_e23_c06_u158	They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him. Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
s05_e23_c06_u159	Why?! What happened?!
s05_e23_c06_u160	Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
s05_e23_c06_u161	I'm so sorry.
s05_e23_c06_u162	Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.
s05_e23_c06_u163	No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
s05_e23_c06_u164	I knew you were not okay with that.
s05_e23_c06_u165	So you're a gladiator! Wow!
s05_e23_c06_u166	Yeah, what-what's going on?
s05_e23_c06_u167	Monica had lunch with Richard.
s05_e23_c06_u168	Dawson?!
s05_e23_c06_u169	Noo! But that would've been so cool!
s05_e23_c06_u170	No! Her boyfriend Richard!
s05_e23_c06_u171	It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
s05_e23_c06_u172	When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
s05_e23_c06_u173	You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
s05_e23_c06_u174	Thanks. (They hug.)
s05_e23_c06_u175	Aww, there we go.
s05_e23_c06_u176	I love Vegas!
s05_e23_c06_u177	I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
s05_e23_c06_u178	(pushing her away from another hug) Next time?
s05_e23_c06_u179	Ooh, so close.
s05_e23_c06_u180	There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
s05_e23_c06_u181	I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
s05_e23_c06_u182	That's so funny, because I think I just did!
s05_e23_c06_u183	Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
s05_e23_c06_u184	Fine with me!
s05_e23_c06_u185	Fine! Happy Anniversary!
s05_e23_c06_u186	Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
s05_e23_c06_u187	No it is not!
s05_e23_c06_u188	What are you talking
s05_e23_c06_u189	Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.)
s05_e23_c07_u190	(taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
s05_e23_c07_u191	(sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!
s05_e23_c07_u192	I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
s05_e23_c07_u193	Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
s05_e23_c07_u194	No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
s05_e23_c07_u195	Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
s05_e23_c07_u196	Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
s05_e23_c07_u197	What?! You totally get embarrassed!
s05_e23_c07_u198	No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
s05_e23_c07_u199	Is that so?
s05_e23_c07_u200	Yeah.
s05_e23_c07_u201	(loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)
s05_e23_c08_u202	Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
s05_e23_c08_u203	Really?
s05_e23_c08_u204	Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right
s05_e23_c08_u205	(interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
s05_e23_c08_u206	All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
s05_e23_c08_u207	Whoa!
s05_e23_c08_u208	Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!
s05_e23_c08_u209	Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)
s05_e23_c08_u210	Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
s05_e23_c08_u211	Good luck!
s05_e23_c08_u212	Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
s05_e23_c08_u213	I see.
s05_e23_c09_u214	(to the bartender) Thank you.
s05_e23_c09_u215	Thanks.
s05_e23_c09_u216	I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
s05_e23_c09_u217	Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so sorry.
s05_e23_c09_u218	This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
s05_e23_c09_u219	So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
s05_e23_c09_u220	Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to find Chandler.)
s05_e23_c09_u221	Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
s05_e23_c09_u222	Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes her head no.)
s05_e23_c09_u223	Comin' out. Place your bet. (Monica does so.) Dice are out. (The woman next to Monica rolls the dice.) Double or nothin'! Pay the front line! (Monica won and doubled the chip.)
s05_e23_c09_u224	Hmm.
s05_e23_c10_u225	Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
s05_e23_c10_u226	Ross! What are you- I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
s05_e23_c10_u227	(to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)
s05_e23_c10_u228	What the? What
s05_e23_c10_u229	(to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants would be dry.) Hi!
s05_e23_c10_u230	Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
s05_e23_c11_u231	(to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)
s05_e23_c11_u232	Changing one hundred! (Gives him the change.) Good luck sir.
s05_e23_c11_u233	(betting all 100) Let's ride.
s05_e23_c11_u234	(Deals the cards) 13.
s05_e23_c11_u235	Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.)
s05_e23_c11_u236	Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
s05_e23_c11_u237	(totally confused) What?
s05_e23_c11_u238	My identical hand twin!
s05_e23_c11_u239	What's an identical hand twin?
s05_e23_c11_u240	What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
s05_e23_c11_u241	Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
s05_e23_c11_u242	Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
s05_e23_c11_u243	(totally confused) How?
s05_e23_c11_u244	Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
s05_e23_c11_u245	Again I must go back to, how?
s05_e23_c11_u246	This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?
s05_e23_c11_u247	(Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
s05_e23_c11_u248	Hey, are you unsupporting me again?
s05_e23_c11_u249	No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
s05_e23_c11_u250	Hey!
s05_e23_c11_u251	Pheebs!!
s05_e23_c11_u252	Yeah?
s05_e23_c11_u253	I found my identical hand twin!
s05_e23_c11_u254	Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
s05_e23_c11_u255	No!
s05_e23_c11_u256	But she just came up here!
s05_e23_c11_u257	That was Joey!
s05_e23_c11_u258	I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
s05_e23_c11_u259	Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
s05_e23_c11_u260	Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
s05_e23_c11_u261	Really?
s05_e23_c11_u262	Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
s05_e23_c11_u263	Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)
s05_e23_c11_u264	Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!
s05_e23_c13_u265	Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)
s05_e23_c13_u266	Ohh, it was the best!
s05_e23_c14_u267	I think the check in is that way. (Points)
s05_e23_c14_u268	Ahh.
s05_e23_c14_u269	Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents drag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.
s05_e23_c14_u270	(sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!
s05_e23_c14_u271	Phoebe! (They hug.)
s05_e23_c14_u272	You guys are here! Yay!
s05_e23_c14_u273	Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)
s05_e23_c14_u274	(sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the slot machine Phoebe was just at.)
s05_e23_c14_u275	Pancho Vila?
s05_e23_c14_u276	Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's "make-up.")
s05_e23_c14_u277	What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't- (She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew on me?!
s05_e23_c14_u278	Hey, you wet my pants!
s05_e23_c14_u279	Whoa, what kind of party was this?
s05_e23_c14_u280	Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)
s05_e23_c14_u281	Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction. Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)
s05_e23_c14_u282	Ugh!
s05_e23_c14_u283	What?
s05_e23_c14_u284	That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
s05_e23_c14_u285	Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.
s05_e23_c14_u286	M-M-Mole people?
s05_e23_c14_u287	What? No-no, a lurker.
s05_e23_c14_u288	Oh. What's a lurker?
s05_e23_c14_u289	Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then
s05_e23_c14_u290	Kills you?
s05_e23_c14_u291	No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
s05_e23_c14_u292	Ohhh!
s05_e23_c14_u293	Uh-hmm.
s05_e23_c14_u294	How do you know about this?
s05_e23_c14_u295	My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
s05_e23_c14_u296	Dance karate?
s05_e23_c14_u297	Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a little dance-type sway.)
s05_e23_c14_u298	(returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won't come off!
s05_e23_c14_u299	What?!
s05_e23_c14_u300	It won't come off!
s05_e23_c14_u301	Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?
s05_e23_c14_u302	No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
s05_e23_c14_u303	(entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!
s05_e23_c14_u304	Joey!!
s05_e23_c14_u305	All right! Hey-hey!
s05_e23_c14_u306	Hi!!
s05_e23_c14_u307	Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her purse.)
s05_e23_c14_u308	(To Joey) Thanks man.
s05_e23_c14_u309	Hi. (She hugs Joey.)
s05_e23_c14_u310	Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.
s05_e23_c14_u311	No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
s05_e23_c14_u312	Your what?
s05_e23_c14_u313	My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
s05_e23_c14_u314	What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
s05_e23_c14_u315	Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
s05_e23_c15_u316	All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
s05_e23_c15_u317	(walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.
s05_e23_c15_u318	Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!
s05_e23_c15_u319	What does it look like? I'm going home.
s05_e23_c15_u320	What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!
s05_e23_c15_u321	Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.
s05_e23_c15_u322	Not any more.
s05_e23_c15_u323	Really?!
s05_e23_c15_u324	Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is empty.
s05_e23_c15_u325	Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
s05_e23_c16_u326	(entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
s05_e23_c16_u327	He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his hand.) See?
s05_e23_c16_u328	Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?
s05_e23_c16_u329	Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.)
s05_e23_c17_u330	(on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you. (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the phone) Yeah, it's not coming off.
s05_e23_c17_u331	What?! What else did he say?
s05_e23_c17_u332	Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So-(Rachel stares at him.) Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
s05_e23_c17_u333	Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
s05_e23_c17_u334	Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.
s05_e23_c17_u335	Ross, I am a human doodle!!
s05_e23_c17_u336	Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) There are tons-of-freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!
s05_e23_c17_u337	Okay, there was some staring and pointing.
s05_e23_c17_u338	Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)
s05_e23_c17_u339	Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big drink!
s05_e23_c17_u340	(she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) Macadamia nut?
s05_e23_c17_u341	(looking at the price list) Umm- Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
s05_e23_c17_u342	Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)
s05_e23_c17_u343	Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?
s05_e23_c17_u344	Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in another direction.)
s05_e23_c18_u345	(seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get! (She throws a quarter at her.)
s05_e23_c18_u346	(arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!
s05_e23_c18_u347	Ohh! You made up!
s05_e23_c18_u348	Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
s05_e23_c18_u349	Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)
s05_e23_c18_u350	Ohh, get a room.
s05_e23_c18_u351	We have one.
s05_e23_c18_u352	I know. Use it.
s05_e23_c19_u353	Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.) That's right, you take good care of those babies!
s05_e23_c19_u354	Excuse me?
s05_e23_c19_u355	It's me, Joey!
s05_e23_c19_u356	Do I know you?
s05_e23_c19_u357	(holds up his hand) Joey!
s05_e23_c19_u358	Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
s05_e23_c19_u359	Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
s05_e23_c19_u360	Nothing?
s05_e23_c19_u361	Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
s05_e23_c19_u362	(tries to leave) I have to get back to
s05_e23_c19_u363	(stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! (Singing, to the tune of This Land is Your Land) This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!
s05_e23_c19_u364	That's okay. (Walks out.)
s05_e23_c19_u365	(following him) But you haven't even heard the chorus!
s05_e23_c20_u366	Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.
s05_e23_c20_u367	(gets up) All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.
s05_e23_c20_u368	Hit me!
s05_e23_c20_u369	(does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)
s05_e23_c20_u370	I bet 20.
s05_e23_c20_u371	You're right! (Gives her the twenty she won.)
s05_e23_c21_u372	(shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the dice.) Yes!
s05_e23_c21_u373	Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
s05_e23_c21_u374	That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?
s05_e23_c21_u375	Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
s05_e23_c21_u376	Pick a number! That is your only job!
s05_e23_c21_u377	8. 8!
s05_e23_c21_u378	Thank you!
s05_e23_c21_u379	If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
s05_e23_c21_u380	Yay!!
s05_e23_c21_u381	8!
s05_e23_c21_u382	Yes!
s05_e23_c21_u383	Yay!!
s05_e23_c21_u384	(To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
s05_e23_c21_u385	Noo!
s05_e23_c21_u386	Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?
s05_e23_c21_u387	Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
s05_e23_c21_u388	What?
s05_e23_c21_u389	Two fours.
s05_e23_c21_u390	Okay. (Rolls the dice)
s05_e23_c21_u391	8!:
s05_e23_c21_u392	(To Chandler) Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!
s05_e23_c21_u393	Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.
s05_e23_c21_u394	All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)
s05_e23_c21_u395	(sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
s05_e23_c21_u396	Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?
s05_e23_c21_u397	Another hard 8.
s05_e23_c21_u398	Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
s05_e23_c21_u399	Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight.
s05_e23_c21_u400	Go! Come on! Roll!
s05_e23_c21_u401	Roll-roll!!
s05_e23_c21_u402	Shut up!! It just got interesting!
s05_e23_c22_u403	What did you just say?
s05_e23_c22_u404	You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
s05_e23_c22_u405	Are you serious?!
s05_e23_c22_u406	Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
s05_e23_c22_u407	I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
s05_e23_c22_u408	Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
s05_e23_c22_u409	Okay!
s05_e23_c22_u410	Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
s05_e23_c22_u411	(spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
s05_e23_c22_u412	It went under the table.
s05_e23_c22_u413	Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
s05_e23_c22_u414	All right!
s05_e23_c22_u415	Here it is! Here it is!
s05_e23_c22_u416	That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
s05_e23_c22_u417	It's a four.
s05_e23_c22_u418	I think so too.
s05_e23_c23_u419	Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!
s05_e23_c23_u420	The Lurker: I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
s05_e23_c23_u421	Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking days are over!
s05_e23_c23_u422	The Lurker: What?!
s05_e23_c23_u423	Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?
s05_e23_c23_u424	The Lurker: Also Monday.
s05_e23_c23_u425	What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
s05_e23_c24_u426	Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with each one.)
s05_e23_c24_u427	(runs out of cards) We need more cards.
s05_e23_c24_u428	Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but stumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, without dialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!
s05_e23_c24_u429	That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.)
s05_e23_c24_u430	Hey!
s05_e23_c24_u431	Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)
s05_e23_c24_u432	Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)
s05_e23_c24_u433	Hi!
s05_e23_c24_u434	Hey!
s05_e23_c24_u435	Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
s05_e23_c24_u436	I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it. Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?
s05_e23_c24_u437	Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.) Hey Rach, how you doin'?
s05_e23_c24_u438	I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?
s05_e23_c24_u439	Ross, don't let her drink anymore! (Exits)
s05_e23_c24_u440	Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!
s05_e23_c24_u441	Ohhh!!
s05_e23_c24_u442	(he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the bed.)
s05_e23_c24_u443	Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?
s05_e23_c24_u444	I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I-I really miss downstairs.
s05_e23_c24_u445	Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.
s05_e23_c24_u446	Well hello! I'm Ross!
s05_e23_c24_u447	Good luck to ya!
s05_e23_c24_u448	Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to the corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
s05_e23_c24_u449	Wow!
s05_e23_c24_u450	(bowing) Hello!
s05_e23_c24_u451	(bowing) Hello!
s05_e23_c25_u452	I won! I won! I finally won!
s05_e23_c25_u453	The Lurker: I won! That was my quarter!
s05_e23_c25_u454	Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.)
s05_e23_c25_u455	The Lurker: (to the guard) Excuse me, sir! This lady played my quarter, this is my money. (Motions to the jackpot.)
s05_e23_c25_u456	(To Phoebe) Is that true miss?
s05_e23_c25_u457	(quietly) Sells drugs to kids.
s05_e23_c25_u458	What?!
s05_e23_c25_u459	She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.)
s05_e23_c25_u460	The Lurker: It was my quarter!
s05_e23_c25_u461	(To Phoebe) Was it her quarter?
s05_e23_c25_u462	How about we talk about this over dinner?
s05_e23_c25_u463	Okay lady, you're out of here.
s05_e23_c25_u464	No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!
s05_e23_c25_u465	I'm just taking you outside!
s05_e23_c25_u466	Oh, okay. (Walks out.)
s05_e23_c26_u467	Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
s05_e23_c26_u468	Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
s05_e23_c26_u469	You're so efficient. I love you!
s05_e23_c26_u470	Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
s05_e23_c26_u471	No-no-no! We need something old!
s05_e23_c26_u472	Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
s05_e23_c26_u473	That'll work!
s05_e23_c26_u474	I don't think so.
s05_e23_c26_u475	Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
s05_e23_c26_u476	(looks around) Here just-take this. (Hands her the sweater.)
s05_e23_c26_u477	That's stealing!
s05_e23_c26_u478	No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
s05_e23_c26_u479	Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)
s05_e23_c26_u480	Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
s05_e23_c27_u481	(sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.)
s05_e23_c27_u482	Are you gonna play?
s05_e23_c27_u483	No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway- (Shakes his hands.)
s05_e23_c27_u484	You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
s05_e23_c27_u485	(throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho! (The dealer stares at him and he stops.)
s05_e23_c27_u486	(entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks down) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
s05_e23_c27_u487	(To Joey) 14.
s05_e23_c27_u488	Hit me! (He does so.)
s05_e23_c27_u489	Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
s05_e23_c27_u490	Stop it!
s05_e23_c27_u491	Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
s05_e23_c27_u492	Please stop it!
s05_e23_c27_u493	Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
s05_e23_c27_u494	(To Joey) If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
s05_e23_c27_u495	(To Phoebe) Didn't I just throw you out of here?
s05_e23_c27_u496	No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!
s05_e23_c27_u497	Come on, lady! (Starts to escort her out.)
s05_e23_c27_u498	Please, please take him too. (Motions to Joey.)
s05_e23_c27_u499	Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by the guard) I'm your hand twin!!
s05_e23_c28_u500	Hello! One marriage please!
s05_e23_c28_u501	Yep, we wanna get married!
s05_e23_c28_u502	(singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
s05_e23_c28_u503	What are you doing?
s05_e23_c28_u504	Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
s05_e23_c28_u505	No, only because that's the graduation song.
s05_e23_c28_u506	Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
s05_e23_c28_u507	Are you sure you wanna do this?
s05_e23_c28_u508	Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
s05_e23_c28_u509	Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)
s05_e23_c28_u510	Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!
s10_e14_c01_u001	(raising his glass) Thank you guys for having us over.
s10_e14_c01_u002	Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
s10_e14_c01_u003	Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
s10_e14_c01_u004	Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
s10_e14_c01_u005	You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)
s10_e14_c01_u006	(entering) Hey, you guys... I have great news.
s10_e14_c01_u007	Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
s10_e14_c01_u008	Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! (they all look at each other when Ross grabs a plate) Guess what happened at work today...
s10_e14_c01_u009	A dinosaur died a million years ago?
s10_e14_c01_u010	Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
s10_e14_c01_u011	Wow!
s10_e14_c01_u012	Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
s10_e14_c01_u013	(while entering) Hi you guys.
s10_e14_c01_u014	Hey.
s10_e14_c01_u015	Ooh, Italian! (she also grabs a plate)
s10_e14_c01_u016	No one wanted seconds, right?
s10_e14_c01_u017	No, no. I-I'm good.
s10_e14_c01_u018	Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
s10_e14_c01_u019	I'm up for tenure.
s10_e14_c01_u020	Congratulations!
s10_e14_c01_u021	You too! What are the odds?
s10_e14_c01_u022	Ooh! (they hug)
s10_e14_c01_u023	(enters) Guess what? (they all look expectantly at him) I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
s10_e14_c01_u024	I don't know who I'm happiest for...
s10_e14_c01_u025	I do, he's been working on that all day! (looking at Joey)
s10_e14_c02_u026	Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
s10_e14_c02_u027	No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. (pats Chandler on his leg)
s10_e14_c02_u028	Where did you go to do it?
s10_e14_c02_u029	Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
s10_e14_c02_u030	YOU NEVER DID IT!
s10_e14_c02_u031	I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
s10_e14_c02_u032	Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
s10_e14_c02_u033	(walks to the couch with coffee for Phoebe) Here you go.
s10_e14_c02_u034	Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
s10_e14_c02_u035	Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
s10_e14_c02_u036	All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
s10_e14_c02_u037	Mrs Hannigan?
s10_e14_c02_u038	What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
s10_e14_c02_u039	(enters) Hey guys.
s10_e14_c02_u040	Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
s10_e14_c02_u041	No, thank you.
s10_e14_c02_u042	All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
s10_e14_c02_u043	Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
s10_e14_c02_u044	But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
s10_e14_c02_u045	Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
s10_e14_c02_u046	You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
s10_e14_c02_u047	Damn it.
s10_e14_c02_u048	See you guys later.
s10_e14_c02_u049	Okay!
s10_e14_c02_u050	(to Joey) I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
s10_e14_c02_u051	Good for you. That was really mature.
s10_e14_c02_u052	What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
s10_e14_c02_u053	You're a strange kind of grown-up.
s10_e14_c02_u054	Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
s10_e14_c02_u055	Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
s10_e14_c02_u056	All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
s10_e14_c02_u057	Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
s10_e14_c02_u058	I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! (he leaves)
s10_e14_c03_u059	(to maitre d') Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
s10_e14_c03_u060	Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
s10_e14_c03_u061	Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
s10_e14_c03_u062	I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
s10_e14_c03_u063	But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
s10_e14_c03_u064	I know. With Gukki
s10_e14_c03_u065	Sssshhhh!
s10_e14_c03_u066	Rachel?
s10_e14_c03_u067	Hi... I'm on a date...
s10_e14_c03_u068	(confused) That's great!
s10_e14_c03_u069	Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
s10_e14_c03_u070	Well, you got uhm... good energy.
s10_e14_c03_u071	Oh.
s10_e14_c03_u072	Rachel?
s10_e14_c03_u073	Yes, hi!
s10_e14_c03_u074	James Campbell...
s10_e14_c03_u075	Hi! (to mr Zellner) Excuse us.
s10_e14_c03_u076	Please... (shows her to sit)
s10_e14_c03_u077	Okay. Oh, yeah... (whispering to mr Zellner) Oh he's cute!
s10_e14_c03_u078	So... your resumé is quite impressive. (Mr Zellner who sits behind Rachel shrugs)
s10_e14_c03_u079	Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
s10_e14_c03_u080	Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumé.
s10_e14_c03_u081	(starts singing la la la la) Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
s10_e14_c03_u082	Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
s10_e14_c03_u083	What? I-I don't.
s10_e14_c03_u084	You don't?
s10_e14_c03_u085	No, I-I-I love it there.
s10_e14_c03_u086	Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
s10_e14_c03_u087	What?
s10_e14_c03_u088	That's Hugo Boss?
s10_e14_c04_u089	(to the woman behind her) This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.) But you obviously haven't.
s10_e14_c04_u090	How can I help you?
s10_e14_c04_u091	I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) You're fun.
s10_e14_c04_u092	You need to fill out this form. (motions for the next person in line)
s10_e14_c04_u093	Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
s10_e14_c04_u094	It can be anything you want.
s10_e14_c04_u095	Well, not anything, I mean...
s10_e14_c04_u096	Yeah... anything.
s10_e14_c04_u097	Oh, this could take a while.
s10_e14_c04_u098	Get out of my line.
s10_e14_c04_u099	Okay.
s10_e14_c05_u100	Hey!
s10_e14_c05_u101	Hey Pheebs.
s10_e14_c05_u102	Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
s10_e14_c05_u103	Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
s10_e14_c05_u104	Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
s10_e14_c05_u105	That's what we were gonna name the baby.
s10_e14_c05_u106	Phoebe!
s10_e14_c05_u107	Uh! Princess Consuela.
s10_e14_c05_u108	You seriously changed your name to that?
s10_e14_c05_u109	Uh-huh!
s10_e14_c05_u110	Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
s10_e14_c05_u111	Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
s10_e14_c05_u112	Hey, how'd the interview go?
s10_e14_c05_u113	Oh! It's not good.
s10_e14_c05_u114	You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
s10_e14_c05_u115	Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
s10_e14_c05_u116	That is a bad interview.
s10_e14_c05_u117	What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
s10_e14_c05_u118	Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
s10_e14_c05_u119	Oh God. I'm so sorry.
s10_e14_c05_u120	Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? (showing the bottle) Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
s10_e14_c05_u121	Ross...
s10_e14_c05_u122	I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
s10_e14_c05_u123	This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
s10_e14_c05_u124	Six? You want me to join you?
s10_e14_c05_u125	Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. (Gunther leaves, hurt) Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
s10_e14_c05_u126	Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
s10_e14_c05_u127	I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
s10_e14_c05_u128	Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
s10_e14_c05_u129	Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
s10_e14_c05_u130	Can you?
s10_e14_c05_u131	Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
s10_e14_c05_u132	And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
s10_e14_c05_u133	And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. (Rachel mouths "aah")
s10_e14_c05_u134	But also knowing it means a lot.
s10_e14_c05_u135	But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
s10_e14_c05_u136	...that center around work.
s10_e14_c05_u137	To Ross!
s10_e14_c05_u138	You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
s10_e14_c05_u139	Oh God!
s10_e14_c05_u140	No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. (Rachel starts crying) Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
s10_e14_c05_u141	(crying) No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
s10_e14_c05_u142	Rach, I'm so sorry.
s10_e14_c05_u143	Oh!
s10_e14_c05_u144	Great. I feel like an idiot.
s10_e14_c05_u145	No, it's okay, you didn't know.
s10_e14_c05_u146	Oh... (to the others) Little heads-up would have been nice.
s10_e14_c06_u147	Thank you for letting us see the house again.
s10_e14_c06_u148	And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
s10_e14_c06_u149	Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through. (she leaves the room)
s10_e14_c06_u150	Ah, so glad you decided to come.
s10_e14_c06_u151	Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
s10_e14_c06_u152	What?
s10_e14_c06_u153	Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
s10_e14_c06_u154	No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
s10_e14_c06_u155	Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
s10_e14_c06_u156	Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
s10_e14_c06_u157	Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching Chandler, who backs out and hits him)
s10_e14_c06_u158	No it's not!
s10_e14_c06_u159	(squinting his eyes) Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
s10_e14_c06_u160	When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
s10_e14_c06_u161	(glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
s10_e14_c06_u162	Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
s10_e14_c06_u163	FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. (He turns his back to them and starts humming) Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
s10_e14_c06_u164	Joey, we know that's you.
s10_e14_c06_u165	no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
s10_e14_c07_u166	Hey (He kisses Phoebe)
s10_e14_c07_u167	Welcome back!
s10_e14_c07_u168	Ah! I missed you
s10_e14_c07_u169	Oh, me too!
s10_e14_c07_u170	So, what's new?
s10_e14_c07_u171	Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
s10_e14_c07_u172	That's great! You changed you name?
s10_e14_c07_u173	Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock! (She smiles from ear to ear)
s10_e14_c07_u174	(afraid) You're kidding right?
s10_e14_c07_u175	Nope.
s10_e14_c07_u176	You really did that?
s10_e14_c07_u177	Yep.
s10_e14_c07_u178	Yeah, but you can't do that.
s10_e14_c07_u179	Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
s10_e14_c07_u180	(looks at her astonished) Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
s10_e14_c07_u181	Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
s10_e14_c07_u182	Crap Bag.
s10_e14_c07_u183	(not amused) Mike Crap Bag?
s10_e14_c07_u184	No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.
s10_e14_c07_u185	You're not serious, right?
s10_e14_c07_u186	Yeah, I'm serious. (sarcastic) It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!
s10_e14_c07_u187	Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
s10_e14_c07_u188	I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.
s10_e14_c07_u189	And I love Crap.
s10_e14_c08_u190	(turns the card around, obviously had the wrong answer) Ow!
s10_e14_c08_u191	Who are you?
s10_e14_c08_u192	Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
s10_e14_c08_u193	I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
s10_e14_c08_u194	(understanding) Oh.
s10_e14_c08_u195	(sighs) I hate my parents.
s10_e14_c08_u196	I hate my friends. (They shake on it as if they just made a pact) Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
s10_e14_c08_u197	Like what?
s10_e14_c08_u198	(thinking) Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
s10_e14_c08_u199	What are you? Eight?
s10_e14_c08_u200	Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
s10_e14_c08_u201	I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
s10_e14_c08_u202	(frustrated) Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
s10_e14_c08_u203	I really don't.
s10_e14_c08_u204	What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
s10_e14_c08_u205	My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
s10_e14_c08_u206	Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
s10_e14_c08_u207	This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. (Joey glares at her angrily) Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
s10_e14_c08_u208	Yeah, yeah, I guess.
s10_e14_c08_u209	Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
s10_e14_c08_u210	(having difficulty admitting it) Yeah, maybe.
s10_e14_c08_u211	Then you gotta let them go.
s10_e14_c08_u212	(In near tears, realizes she is right) I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
s10_e14_c08_u213	I read a lot.
s10_e14_c08_u214	(his mood changes instantly) Just when I thought we could be friends. (he leaves the room)
s10_e14_c09_u215	Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
s10_e14_c09_u216	Oh, thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)
s10_e14_c09_u217	You still don't know my name, do you?
s10_e14_c09_u218	(Is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) Well, now I don't have to. (The man leaves instantly)
s10_e14_c09_u219	(annoyed) Ross, what is taking you so long?
s10_e14_c09_u220	(stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder, looking very annoyed. He finally manages) (sarcastic) I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
s10_e14_c09_u221	Rachel?
s10_e14_c09_u222	(turns around) Mark? Oh my God! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
s10_e14_c09_u223	How've you been?
s10_e14_c09_u224	I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
s10_e14_c09_u225	Sure, sure. (To Ross) What's with the chair. (Rachel signals him not to mention she's been fired)
s10_e14_c09_u226	Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so... (laughs stupidly)
s10_e14_c09_u227	Clever. (back to Rachel) So how are you?
s10_e14_c09_u228	Oh, well, (looks at her box and chair) you're not catching me on my best day.
s10_e14_c09_u229	Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
s10_e14_c09_u230	No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
s10_e14_c09_u231	Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
s10_e14_c09_u232	Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
s10_e14_c09_u233	Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
s10_e14_c09_u234	Great! I'll call ya!
s10_e14_c09_u235	(shakes Ross' hand) Nice to see you.
s10_e14_c09_u236	Yeah! yeah, I got tenure! (Mark looks at him strangely and walks off)
s10_e14_c09_u237	(very excited) Oh my God!
s10_e14_c09_u238	See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
s10_e14_c09_u239	Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
s10_e14_c09_u240	(realizing) That is Mark?
s10_e14_c09_u241	Yes.
s10_e14_c09_u242	I hate that guy.
s10_e14_c09_u243	Oh.
s10_e14_c09_u244	No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
s10_e14_c09_u245	What? You don't want me to get a job?
s10_e14_c09_u246	Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
s10_e14_c09_u247	Ugh.
s10_e14_c09_u248	I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
s10_e14_c09_u249	Ross, you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security. (Takes her box and leaves. Ross follows her and then returns for the chair. He stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction Rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)
s10_e14_c10_u250	Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
s10_e14_c10_u251	Man, those two dogs are going at it!
s10_e14_c10_u252	(entering) Hey!
s10_e14_c10_u253	Hey.
s10_e14_c10_u254	Hey, where have you been?
s10_e14_c10_u255	Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
s10_e14_c10_u256	Really? What changed your mind?
s10_e14_c10_u257	Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
s10_e14_c10_u258	Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
s10_e14_c10_u259	(frightened) What?
s10_e14_c10_u260	Ha! I'm just messing with you.
s10_e14_c10_u261	That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
s10_e14_c10_u262	Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
s10_e14_c10_u263	What? I get my own room?
s10_e14_c10_u264	You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
s10_e14_c10_u265	Oh my God! (they all hug) Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
s10_e14_c10_u266	No!
s10_e14_c10_u267	Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
s10_e14_c11_u268	After you, miss Banana Hammock.
s10_e14_c11_u269	Thank you, mister Bag.
s10_e14_c11_u270	Oh hey, how are you?
s10_e14_c11_u271	Oh hi Rita! Good! (to Mike) Oh, Rita's a massage client.
s10_e14_c11_u272	Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
s10_e14_c11_u273	(shrugs) Er, Rita, this is my husband.
s10_e14_c11_u274	Oh! (they shake hands)
s10_e14_c11_u275	Yeah.
s10_e14_c11_u276	Why don't you tell her my name?
s10_e14_c11_u277	(without moving her lips, wearing a fake smile) Okay, I will. (to Rita) This is my husband Crap Bag.
s10_e14_c11_u278	Crap Bag?
s10_e14_c11_u279	If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
s10_e14_c11_u280	Okay. Excuse me...
s10_e14_c11_u281	Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
s10_e14_c11_u282	Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
s10_e14_c11_u283	How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
s10_e14_c11_u284	Really?
s10_e14_c11_u285	Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
s10_e14_c11_u286	Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
s10_e14_c11_u287	It's a funny word.
s10_e14_c11_u288	It's a Speedo.
s10_e14_c11_u289	...Oh crap!
s10_e14_c12_u290	Hey, is Rachel here?
s10_e14_c12_u291	No.
s10_e14_c12_u292	She's still at dinner?
s10_e14_c12_u293	I guess. Why? Who's she with?
s10_e14_c12_u294	That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
s10_e14_c12_u295	It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!
s10_e14_c12_u296	We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
s10_e14_c12_u297	So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
s10_e14_c12_u298	Excuse me?
s10_e14_c12_u299	Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
s10_e14_c12_u300	For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
s10_e14_c12_u301	Oh, sorry!
s10_e14_c12_u302	(entering) Hi you guys!
s10_e14_c12_u303	Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
s10_e14_c12_u304	Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
s10_e14_c12_u305	(speaking without pause, agitated) Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
s10_e14_c12_u306	Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
s10_e14_c12_u307	Should we send something?
s10_e14_c12_u308	How did the job stuff go?
s10_e14_c12_u309	He offered me one.
s10_e14_c12_u310	That's great!
s10_e14_c12_u311	Congratulations!
s10_e14_c12_u312	I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
s10_e14_c12_u313	Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. (gasps) You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
s10_e14_c12_u314	The job is in Paris. (they all stare at each other)
s10_e14_c13_u315	I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
s10_e14_c13_u316	(at the other end of the line) I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on. (she puts the phone at the bears ear)
s10_e14_c13_u317	Hey bear, I need some career advice.
s06_e05_c01_u001	I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
s06_e05_c01_u002	Look I was going to tell you!
s06_e05_c01_u003	When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
s06_e05_c01_u004	What?
s06_e05_c01_u005	You're kidding!
s06_e05_c01_u006	(overdoing it) Oh my God!!
s06_e05_c01_u007	Ross!
s06_e05_c01_u008	Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
s06_e05_c01_u009	Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
s06_e05_c01_u010	Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. (He laughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
s06_e05_c01_u011	Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
s06_e05_c01_u012	Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
s06_e05_c01_u013	Another lie. You have a sickness!
s06_e05_c01_u014	Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?
s06_e05_c02_u015	Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. (Looks at them) Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcriber's note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche, I'd have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther, these yours?
s06_e05_c02_u016	Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
s06_e05_c02_u017	Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?
s06_e05_c02_u018	Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?
s06_e05_c02_u019	There's a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)
s06_e05_c02_u020	You left a shoe here?!
s06_e05_c02_u021	Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)
s06_e05_c02_u022	Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
s06_e05_c02_u023	Great! Thanks. (Exits.)
s06_e05_c02_u024	(coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
s06_e05_c02_u025	Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
s06_e05_c02_u026	(not enthused) Yeah, all right.
s06_e05_c02_u027	Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya! (Exits.)
s06_e05_c02_u028	Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
s06_e05_c02_u029	(stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous cause I've never done that before by myself!
s06_e05_c02_u030	Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it.
s06_e05_c02_u031	Yeah, I'm gonna pass. Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
s06_e05_c02_u032	Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when-(realizes what she's about to say and changes)-people with babies come to visit.
s06_e05_c03_u033	Nice car!
s06_e05_c03_u034	Yeah, it's not mine.
s06_e05_c03_u035	(walking up) I love your car.
s06_e05_c03_u036	Yeah, it's (looks up and sees the woman) mine.
s06_e05_c03_u037	I bet it's fast.
s06_e05_c03_u038	Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
s06_e05_c03_u039	Yeah!
s06_e05_c03_u040	(checks in the window to make sure it has them) It's got em!
s06_e05_c04_u041	So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
s06_e05_c04_u042	What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate.
s06_e05_c04_u043	Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
s06_e05_c04_u044	Maybe you could be my roommate!
s06_e05_c04_u045	Well there's an idea!!
s06_e05_c04_u046	Yeah!
s06_e05_c04_u047	That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
s06_e05_c04_u048	Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th.
s06_e05_c04_u049	December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause.
s06_e05_c04_u050	(deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.
s06_e05_c04_u051	Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything.
s06_e05_c04_u052	Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!
s06_e05_c04_u053	Okay Rach, but
s06_e05_c04_u054	Op! You're peeping!
s06_e05_c04_u055	Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!
s06_e05_c04_u056	Look I told you
s06_e05_c04_u057	I don't wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"
s06_e05_c04_u058	Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!
s06_e05_c04_u059	Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!
s06_e05_c04_u060	What about the time I said we were on a break?
s06_e05_c04_u061	Ugh! (Stares at him.)
s06_e05_c05_u062	Pheebs, how's it going?
s06_e05_c05_u063	(rapidly) I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
s06_e05_c05_u064	Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
s06_e05_c05_u065	Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. It's times like these I'm glad Smell-O-Vision hasn't been invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)
s06_e05_c05_u066	Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
s06_e05_c05_u067	See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
s06_e05_c05_u068	What do you mean?
s06_e05_c05_u069	I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around- (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)
s06_e05_c05_u070	That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
s06_e05_c05_u071	Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
s06_e05_c05_u072	This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
s06_e05_c05_u073	Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.
s06_e05_c05_u074	(entering) Hey guys!
s06_e05_c05_u075	Hey!
s06_e05_c05_u076	Hey!
s06_e05_c05_u077	Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!
s06_e05_c05_u078	Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
s06_e05_c05_u079	You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
s06_e05_c05_u080	What equity investments?
s06_e05_c05_u081	The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
s06_e05_c05_u082	Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
s06_e05_c05_u083	You don't even have a car!
s06_e05_c05_u084	I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.
s06_e05_c05_u085	And?
s06_e05_c05_u086	And six others.
s06_e05_c05_u087	There you are.
s06_e05_c06_u088	Yeah, she tops out at 130.
s06_e05_c06_u089	Wow!
s06_e05_c06_u090	And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
s06_e05_c06_u091	Really! You got a place upstate?
s06_e05_c06_u092	Sure!
s06_e05_c06_u093	Well, I'll see you later.
s06_e05_c06_u094	Okay, take it easy.
s06_e05_c06_u095	Hey! That's my car.
s06_e05_c06_u096	Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
s06_e05_c06_u097	What-what are you doing?
s06_e05_c06_u098	Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.
s06_e05_c06_u099	But it's my car!
s06_e05_c06_u100	Yeah, but it's my wax.
s06_e05_c06_u101	Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
s06_e05_c06_u102	Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) I'll uh, save your parking spot.
s06_e05_c06_u103	I'm not coming back.
s06_e05_c06_u104	Why not?
s06_e05_c06_u105	I live upstate.
s06_e05_c06_u106	Yeah, so did I.
s06_e05_c07_u107	I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
s06_e05_c07_u108	Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.
s06_e05_c07_u109	(entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)
s06_e05_c07_u110	Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!
s06_e05_c07_u111	He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
s06_e05_c07_u112	No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.
s06_e05_c07_u113	They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
s06_e05_c07_u114	What?!
s06_e05_c07_u115	Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)
s06_e05_c07_u116	Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
s06_e05_c07_u117	Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
s06_e05_c07_u118	Oh, I can still do that.
s06_e05_c07_u119	How are you still single?!
s06_e05_c07_u120	(entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
s06_e05_c07_u121	Good. What made you change your mind?
s06_e05_c07_u122	I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
s06_e05_c07_u123	How did that happen?!!
s06_e05_c07_u124	Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)
s06_e05_c07_u125	Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)
s06_e05_c08_u126	Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?
s06_e05_c08_u127	Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
s06_e05_c08_u128	So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.
s06_e05_c08_u129	Fine, I'm mentally unstable.
s06_e05_c08_u130	And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.
s06_e05_c08_u131	What?!
s06_e05_c08_u132	Uh yes, heroin and crack.
s06_e05_c08_u133	Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
s06_e05_c08_u134	Well, you would know.
s06_e05_c08_u135	Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?
s06_e05_c08_u136	Oh, come on!
s06_e05_c08_u137	(starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!
s06_e05_c08_u138	And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
s06_e05_c08_u139	Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
s06_e05_c08_u140	That won't be necessary.
s06_e05_c08_u141	And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
s06_e05_c08_u142	Ugh!
s06_e05_c08_u143	Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
s06_e05_c08_u144	Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! (To the stenographer) And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
s06_e05_c08_u145	Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?
s06_e05_c08_u146	Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
s06_e05_c08_u147	Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.
s06_e05_c08_u148	(stands up) That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
s06_e05_c08_u149	(stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
s06_e05_c08_u150	And what-(notices the stenographer is still typing)-What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He's still typing.) Stop typing! Stop typing!!
s06_e05_c08_u151	(to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!
s06_e05_c08_u152	You need to get out of my chambers.
s06_e05_c08_u153	All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
s06_e05_c08_u154	Yeah!
s06_e05_c08_u155	Would you like to spend the night in jail?
s06_e05_c08_u156	And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)
s06_e05_c09_u157	(entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his car back.
s06_e05_c09_u158	But you found the keys to his clothes?
s06_e05_c09_u159	No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
s06_e05_c09_u160	And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
s06_e05_c09_u161	Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
s06_e05_c09_u162	That is true.
s06_e05_c09_u163	Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
s06_e05_c09_u164	Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to leave.)
s06_e05_c09_u165	Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
s06_e05_c09_u166	Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her! (Storms out.)
s06_e05_c09_u167	Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
s06_e05_c09_u168	All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.
s06_e05_c09_u169	What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!
s06_e05_c09_u170	The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!
s06_e05_c09_u171	But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
s06_e05_c09_u172	He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.
s06_e05_c09_u173	But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
s06_e05_c09_u174	I think that's gum.
s06_e05_c09_u175	I'm pretty sure it's gun.
s06_e05_c09_u176	Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.
s06_e05_c09_u177	A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! (They don't stop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)
s06_e05_c10_u178	Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
s06_e05_c10_u179	Maybe because you've got the keys?
s06_e05_c10_u180	(to women passing him) Porsche.
s06_e05_c10_u181	This is totally your fault!
s06_e05_c10_u182	My fault?! You threatened the judge!
s06_e05_c10_u183	Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!
s06_e05_c10_u184	That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
s06_e05_c10_u185	Hi! How are the Gellers?
s06_e05_c10_u186	Don't call us that! (Storms away)
s06_e05_c10_u187	The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)
s06_e05_c10_u188	Hey! It's Porsche!! (He's right y'know.)
s06_e05_c11_u189	Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. (She crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the vase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there! (They both have disappeared as well.)
s06_e05_c11_u190	(entering) Hey!
s06_e05_c11_u191	(exhausted) How do you feel?
s06_e05_c11_u192	Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
s06_e05_c11_u193	Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed.
s06_e05_c11_u194	And protected them from a tornado?
s06_e05_c11_u195	Oh my God.
s06_e05_c11_u196	I know, the babies are asleep.
s06_e05_c11_u197	Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
s06_e05_c11_u198	I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
s06_e05_c11_u199	But my apartment!
s06_e05_c11_u200	Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
s06_e05_c11_u201	But the mess!
s06_e05_c11_u202	Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
s06_e05_c11_u203	You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
s06_e05_c11_u204	(pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
s06_e05_c12_u205	(deadpan) Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.
s06_e05_c12_u206	I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little X's where you need to sign.
s06_e05_c12_u207	Oh, little X's! Great! That makes up for everything!
s06_e05_c12_u208	Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
s06_e05_c12_u209	Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
s06_e05_c12_u210	Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
s06_e05_c12_u211	Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
s06_e05_c12_u212	Yeah! Right!
s06_e05_c12_u213	You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?
s06_e05_c12_u214	Nothing. (Sits down.)
s06_e05_c12_u215	Okay, can we just sign please?
s06_e05_c12_u216	Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page out of the way.)
s06_e05_c12_u217	Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)
s06_e05_c12_u218	Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.
s06_e05_c12_u219	What?
s06_e05_c12_u220	Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.
s06_e05_c12_u221	Excuse me?
s06_e05_c12_u222	Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
s06_e05_c12_u223	Yeah?
s06_e05_c12_u224	And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.
s06_e05_c12_u225	So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your fault.
s06_e05_c12_u226	Yeah, don't push it though.
s06_e05_c12_u227	I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
s06_e05_c12_u228	I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)
s06_e05_c12_u229	Did I, did I even treat?
s06_e05_c12_u230	No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
s06_e05_c12_u231	That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
s06_e05_c12_u232	Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.
s06_e05_c12_u233	Eh, no problem.
s06_e05_c12_u234	I'm gonna need a copy of those.
s06_e05_c12_u235	Totally. (Exits.)
s06_e05_c13_u236	Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
s06_e05_c13_u237	(the same one from before approaches) Hi Joey.
s06_e05_c13_u238	Hey! How you doin'?
s06_e05_c13_u239	(to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
s06_e05_c13_u240	I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)
s03_e01_c01_u001	I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
s03_e01_c01_u002	Did not, she did not wink at you...(sees that their sacred couch is occupied by strangers).
s03_e01_c01_u003	Huh. (They all leave, dejected)
s03_e01_c02_u004	I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
s03_e01_c02_u005	Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
s03_e01_c02_u006	See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
s03_e01_c02_u007	What song was that, Pheebs?
s03_e01_c02_u008	(singing) Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
s03_e01_c02_u009	Hi Monica!
s03_e01_c02_u010	Hey Mon!
s03_e01_c02_u011	Hey Mon!
s03_e01_c02_u012	Oh my God, has she slept at all?
s03_e01_c02_u013	Nope.
s03_e01_c02_u014	No, it's been three nights in a row.
s03_e01_c02_u015	Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
s03_e01_c02_u016	Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
s03_e01_c03_u017	Morning.
s03_e01_c03_u018	Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
s03_e01_c03_u019	Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
s03_e01_c03_u020	(entering and singing) Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. (laughs hysterically) Good morning Joey.
s03_e01_c03_u021	(sarcastically) Good morning.
s03_e01_c03_u022	Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
s03_e01_c03_u023	Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
s03_e01_c03_u024	I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
s03_e01_c03_u025	(laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
s03_e01_c03_u026	Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
s03_e01_c03_u027	(under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!
s03_e01_c03_u028	I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
s03_e01_c03_u029	B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
s03_e01_c03_u030	Nope, not this time.
s03_e01_c03_u031	Come on, quite yankin' me.
s03_e01_c03_u032	I'm not yanking you.
s03_e01_c03_u033	This is Janice.
s03_e01_c03_u034	Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
s03_e01_c03_u035	Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
s03_e01_c03_u036	(looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)
s03_e01_c04_u037	God, look what I found in the drain.
s03_e01_c04_u038	What?!
s03_e01_c04_u039	It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with this?
s03_e01_c04_u040	Getting it away from me would be job one.
s03_e01_c04_u041	It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)
s03_e01_c04_u042	Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down the drain.)
s03_e01_c04_u043	God, what is wrong with me.
s03_e01_c04_u044	You need to get some sleep.
s03_e01_c04_u045	I need to get some Richard.
s03_e01_c04_u046	Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
s03_e01_c04_u047	I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
s03_e01_c04_u048	Maybe, because you told him not to.
s03_e01_c04_u049	What are you the memory woman?
s03_e01_c04_u050	(entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
s03_e01_c04_u051	Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
s03_e01_c04_u052	Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
s03_e01_c04_u053	Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
s03_e01_c04_u054	There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
s03_e01_c04_u055	Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
s03_e01_c04_u056	Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
s03_e01_c05_u057	(she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....
s03_e01_c05_u058	Hmm?
s03_e01_c05_u059	Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
s03_e01_c05_u060	Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
s03_e01_c05_u061	Hmm.
s03_e01_c05_u062	I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
s03_e01_c05_u063	You remember not having sex in high school, right?
s03_e01_c05_u064	Yeah.
s03_e01_c05_u065	Well honey, what about you?
s03_e01_c05_u066	What?
s03_e01_c05_u067	I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
s03_e01_c05_u068	No.
s03_e01_c05_u069	Come on you gotta have one!
s03_e01_c05_u070	Nope.
s03_e01_c05_u071	Ross, you know what...
s03_e01_c05_u072	What?
s03_e01_c05_u073	...if you tell me, I might do it.
s03_e01_c05_u074	Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
s03_e01_c05_u075	Yeah.
s03_e01_c05_u076	Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
s03_e01_c05_u077	Oooh!
s03_e01_c05_u078	Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
s03_e01_c06_u079	Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
s03_e01_c06_u080	Really!
s03_e01_c06_u081	Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
s03_e01_c06_u082	Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
s03_e01_c06_u083	Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
s03_e01_c06_u084	Really! That-that great huh?
s03_e01_c06_u085	No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
s03_e01_c06_u086	(entering with Monica in tow) Hey!
s03_e01_c06_u087	Hi you guys!
s03_e01_c06_u088	Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
s03_e01_c06_u089	Mon. Hi!
s03_e01_c06_u090	Hi.
s03_e01_c06_u091	Why aren't you at work?
s03_e01_c06_u092	Oh, they-they sent me home.
s03_e01_c06_u093	Why?
s03_e01_c06_u094	Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
s03_e01_c06_u095	Okay.
s03_e01_c06_u096	You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
s03_e01_c06_u097	I know I do.
s03_e01_c06_u098	Hi.
s03_e01_c06_u099	Hi.
s03_e01_c06_u100	Guess what?
s03_e01_c06_u101	What?
s03_e01_c06_u102	They published my paper.
s03_e01_c06_u103	Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
s03_e01_c06_u104	Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. (Ross stands up horrified) There he is.
s03_e01_c07_u105	Hey!
s03_e01_c07_u106	Wheel!
s03_e01_c07_u107	Of!
s03_e01_c07_u108	Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!
s03_e01_c07_u109	You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
s03_e01_c07_u110	I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
s03_e01_c07_u111	No, Janice.
s03_e01_c07_u112	Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
s03_e01_c07_u113	You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
s03_e01_c07_u114	No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?
s03_e01_c07_u115	Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
s03_e01_c07_u116	Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
s03_e01_c07_u117	Well, there you go.
s03_e01_c07_u118	Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
s03_e01_c07_u119	Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.
s03_e01_c07_u120	Look, what do you want me to say?
s03_e01_c07_u121	I want you to say that you like her!
s03_e01_c07_u122	I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
s03_e01_c07_u123	Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
s03_e01_c07_u124	Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? (Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')
s03_e01_c08_u125	How could you have told her?
s03_e01_c08_u126	Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
s03_e01_c08_u127	Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
s03_e01_c08_u128	Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
s03_e01_c08_u129	Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
s03_e01_c08_u130	Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
s03_e01_c08_u131	That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
s03_e01_c08_u132	Were both of those Joey?
s03_e01_c08_u133	Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
s03_e01_c08_u134	Not even with your best friend.
s03_e01_c08_u135	Noo!
s03_e01_c08_u136	That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
s03_e01_c08_u137	Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
s03_e01_c08_u138	Pretty much.
s03_e01_c08_u139	Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
s03_e01_c08_u140	Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
s03_e01_c08_u141	I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
s03_e01_c09_u142	( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
s03_e01_c09_u143	Richard's living room, drinking wine.
s03_e01_c09_u144	All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
s03_e01_c09_u145	I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
s03_e01_c09_u146	Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
s03_e01_c09_u147	All right, I'll try not to.
s03_e01_c09_u148	Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
s03_e01_c09_u149	Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
s03_e01_c09_u150	All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
s03_e01_c09_u151	I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
s03_e01_c09_u152	All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
s03_e01_c09_u153	Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
s03_e01_c10_u154	So, I hear, you hate me!
s03_e01_c10_u155	I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
s03_e01_c10_u156	A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
s03_e01_c10_u157	And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
s03_e01_c10_u158	All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
s03_e01_c10_u159	But what does that gonna do...
s03_e01_c10_u160	For Chandler!
s03_e01_c10_u161	Okay. I'm in.
s03_e01_c10_u162	Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
s03_e01_c10_u163	Does it have to be a whole day?
s03_e01_c10_u164	Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
s03_e01_c10_u165	Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
s03_e01_c11_u166	(crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
s03_e01_c11_u167	Monica, do you want us to take you home?
s03_e01_c11_u168	Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe leave)
s03_e01_c11_u169	Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
s03_e01_c11_u170	Umm, yeah.
s03_e01_c11_u171	No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
s03_e01_c11_u172	Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
s03_e01_c11_u173	Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
s03_e01_c11_u174	We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
s03_e01_c11_u175	Nooo!
s03_e01_c11_u176	Yeah, okay.
s03_e01_c11_u177	Yeah?
s03_e01_c11_u178	Yeah! All right! You go first.
s03_e01_c11_u179	Okay, okay, I'll go first.
s03_e01_c11_u180	Okay.
s03_e01_c11_u181	So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
s03_e01_c11_u182	Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
s03_e01_c11_u183	Yes!
s03_e01_c11_u184	I know!
s03_e01_c11_u185	Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
s03_e01_c11_u186	Okay.
s03_e01_c11_u187	Okay.
s03_e01_c11_u188	Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
s03_e01_c11_u189	Hmph.
s03_e01_c11_u190	And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
s03_e01_c11_u191	With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
s03_e01_c11_u192	I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!
s03_e01_c11_u193	Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
s03_e01_c11_u194	You said...
s03_e01_c11_u195	I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).
s03_e01_c12_u196	We're baack!
s03_e01_c12_u197	Hey!
s03_e01_c12_u198	What are you guys doing together?
s03_e01_c12_u199	Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!! (laughs)
s03_e01_c12_u200	Really.
s03_e01_c12_u201	Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
s03_e01_c12_u202	I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)
s03_e01_c12_u203	You still can't stand her can you?
s03_e01_c12_u204	I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
s03_e01_c12_u205	Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
s03_e01_c12_u206	But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
s03_e01_c12_u207	Well, I guess that's something.
s03_e01_c12_u208	No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
s03_e01_c12_u209	Okay.
s03_e01_c12_u210	Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
s03_e01_c12_u211	Oh God!
s03_e01_c12_u212	Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
s03_e01_c12_u213	Really?
s03_e01_c12_u214	Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
s03_e01_c13_u215	Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
s03_e01_c13_u216	Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. (hugs her) Since when did you start smoking cigars?
s03_e01_c13_u217	I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
s03_e01_c13_u218	Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
s03_e01_c13_u219	What makes you think that I might not be okay?
s03_e01_c13_u220	I saw Richard.
s03_e01_c13_u221	Oh.
s03_e01_c13_u222	So, how are you doing?
s03_e01_c13_u223	I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
s03_e01_c13_u224	You don't wanna know.
s03_e01_c13_u225	No, I really, really do.
s03_e01_c13_u226	Well, he's doing terrible!
s03_e01_c13_u227	Really!
s03_e01_c13_u228	Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
s03_e01_c13_u229	You're not just saying that are you?
s03_e01_c13_u230	No, the man is a mess.
s03_e01_c13_u231	Was he crying?
s03_e01_c13_u232	No.
s03_e01_c13_u233	Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
s03_e01_c13_u234	Maybe.
s03_e01_c13_u235	I think so.
s03_e01_c13_u236	Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns around and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks up the cigar, and starts watching the video)
s03_e01_c14_u237	Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
s03_e01_c14_u238	No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom standing where Rachel is)
s03_e01_c14_u239	I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around and down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)
s08_e17_c01_u001	Joey? Are you in there?
s08_e17_c01_u002	(hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That's Rachel!
s08_e17_c01_u003	Joey, you have to talk to her!
s08_e17_c01_u004	No-no, I can't! I can't! Not after the other night, it's just it's-too weird, okay? Don't tell her I'm here! (Turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don't eat that! (Runs to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)
s08_e17_c01_u005	Hey!
s08_e17_c01_u006	Hey!
s08_e17_c01_u007	Hey Rachel!
s08_e17_c01_u008	Is Joey here?
s08_e17_c01_u009	I don't see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
s08_e17_c01_u010	I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! (Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)
s08_e17_c01_u011	Well, at least you make each other laugh.
s08_e17_c01_u012	What's up?
s08_e17_c01_u013	Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he y'know- I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
s08_e17_c01_u014	We were playing a game.
s08_e17_c01_u015	Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
s08_e17_c01_u016	Sure.
s08_e17_c01_u017	What?! No! No!
s08_e17_c01_u018	All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh-tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)
s08_e17_c01_u019	(To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?
s08_e17_c01_u020	Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler) Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
s08_e17_c01_u021	Honey, you gotta talk to her.
s08_e17_c01_u022	I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
s08_e17_c01_u023	(incredulous) I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
s08_e17_c01_u024	Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
s08_e17_c01_u025	All right so, so what do I do?
s08_e17_c01_u026	This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
s08_e17_c01_u027	Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your
s08_e17_c01_u028	(interrupting him) We didn't play it!!
s08_e17_c02_u029	Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
s08_e17_c02_u030	I didn't know you read tea leaves.
s08_e17_c02_u031	Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability. Y'know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
s08_e17_c02_u032	Okay, I'm done. Read mine.
s08_e17_c02_u033	Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book) Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
s08_e17_c02_u034	(stunned) I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
s08_e17_c02_u035	Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?
s08_e17_c02_u036	Okay, I'm done. Do mine.
s08_e17_c02_u037	Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
s08_e17_c02_u038	Ah.
s08_e17_c02_u039	Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!
s08_e17_c02_u040	Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
s08_e17_c02_u041	What does yours say Pheebs?
s08_e17_c02_u042	Umm- Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)
s08_e17_c02_u043	(entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It's a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
s08_e17_c02_u044	You mean your pink shirt?
s08_e17_c02_u045	Faded salmon color.
s08_e17_c02_u046	No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.
s08_e17_c02_u047	Great! Great. Then I must've left it at Mona's. I knew it!
s08_e17_c02_u048	Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's.
s08_e17_c02_u049	That's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
s08_e17_c02_u050	Well just ask Mona to give it back!
s08_e17_c02_u051	I don't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks away.)
s08_e17_c02_u052	(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a second you guys-for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)
s08_e17_c02_u053	Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
s08_e17_c02_u054	Hi!
s08_e17_c02_u055	Hey.
s08_e17_c02_u056	Hi.
s08_e17_c02_u057	Hi.
s08_e17_c02_u058	Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
s08_e17_c03_u059	So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it's not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
s08_e17_c03_u060	I know it's tough now, but things will get better.
s08_e17_c03_u061	How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!
s08_e17_c03_u062	I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
s08_e17_c03_u063	Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
s08_e17_c03_u064	Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
s08_e17_c03_u065	Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
s08_e17_c03_u066	In the James Taylor case.
s08_e17_c03_u067	Where is the James Taylor CD?
s08_e17_c03_u068	Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
s08_e17_c03_u069	Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
s08_e17_c03_u070	Well, if we're gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y'know alphabetically or by genre?
s08_e17_c03_u071	Hmm, I don't know. We really have to talk this through.
s08_e17_c03_u072	Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
s08_e17_c03_u073	Okay, I-I'm sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
s08_e17_c03_u074	Oh yeah. That makes sense.
s08_e17_c03_u075	Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
s08_e17_c03_u076	Ooh, I can do that.
s08_e17_c03_u077	Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
s08_e17_c03_u078	They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica's look) in exchange for money.
s08_e17_c03_u079	(entering) Hey!
s08_e17_c03_u080	Hi.
s08_e17_c03_u081	Uh I really don't know what to tell you Rach, I really don't. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
s08_e17_c03_u082	What?
s08_e17_c03_u083	Yeah Joey she's-Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y'know what, if we're gonna make dinner we're gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)
s08_e17_c03_u084	So you uh, have a-big work problem?
s08_e17_c03_u085	Yeah it's umm- Yeah it's uh- It-it's y'know-It's nothing.
s08_e17_c03_u086	Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I'm gonna take off.
s08_e17_c03_u087	Yeah-No wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm-it's my boss.
s08_e17_c03_u088	Yeah?
s08_e17_c03_u089	Yeah, and umm my baby.
s08_e17_c03_u090	Yeah?
s08_e17_c03_u091	My boss wants to buy my baby!
s08_e17_c03_u092	What?! Oh my-oh my God!
s08_e17_c03_u093	I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
s08_e17_c03_u094	What he wants to buy your baby?!
s08_e17_c03_u095	Can you believe that?!
s08_e17_c03_u096	That's crazy!
s08_e17_c03_u097	That's what I told him!
s08_e17_c03_u098	Okay, how did this even happen?
s08_e17_c03_u099	Well I'll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his wife-They-they can't have children. So umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
s08_e17_c03_u100	Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
s08_e17_c03_u101	Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
s08_e17_c04_u102	Oh hello.
s08_e17_c04_u103	Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim, Jim Nelson.
s08_e17_c04_u104	Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
s08_e17_c04_u105	We have. Maybe we'll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o'clock?
s08_e17_c04_u106	Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and the exchange information.)
s08_e17_c05_u107	Mona? (There's no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Mona's apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
s08_e17_c05_u108	(entering, with her date) I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
s08_e17_c05_u109	Oh, it's okay.
s08_e17_c05_u110	No, it's still wet. Y'know what? Let me get it out before it sets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here. (Hands him Ross's shirt.)
s08_e17_c05_u111	Oh umm, I-I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
s08_e17_c05_u112	No-no that's a man's shirt.
s08_e17_c05_u113	It's awfully pink. (Ross mouths, "It's salmon!")
s08_e17_c06_u114	Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
s08_e17_c06_u115	Honey, both yours.
s08_e17_c06_u116	(entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
s08_e17_c06_u117	Yeah? The work problem?
s08_e17_c06_u118	Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
s08_e17_c06_u119	What problem did you tell him you had?
s08_e17_c06_u120	Oh that's not important. The point is, I really-I think everything's gonna be okay.
s08_e17_c07_u121	May I help you?
s08_e17_c07_u122	Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
s08_e17_c08_u123	Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other? It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
s08_e17_c08_u124	Someone does. Me.
s08_e17_c08_u125	Oh, witty banter. Well done.
s08_e17_c08_u126	So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
s08_e17_c08_u127	Oh okay, well I'm a masseuse, and I used to work at this place
s08_e17_c08_u128	Do you like to party?
s08_e17_c08_u129	I-I-I like, I like parties.
s08_e17_c08_u130	You're wild, aren't ya?
s08_e17_c08_u131	Yeah I guess, a little.
s08_e17_c08_u132	It ain't no thing, I'm wild too.
s08_e17_c08_u133	(a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm-Well since I was fourteen.
s08_e17_c08_u134	I'm sorry. I'm staring. It's just that you have the most beautiful eyes.
s08_e17_c08_u135	Oh stop it.
s08_e17_c08_u136	And your breasts! Hmm!!!
s08_e17_c08_u137	Okay. Umm look, you're coming on a little strong. But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don't we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
s08_e17_c08_u138	All right.
s08_e17_c08_u139	Okay.
s08_e17_c08_u140	I write erotic novels, for children.
s08_e17_c08_u141	What?!
s08_e17_c08_u142	They're wildly unpopular.
s08_e17_c08_u143	Oh my God!
s08_e17_c08_u144	Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
s08_e17_c08_u145	Wow! You do?
s08_e17_c08_u146	Yeah, (looks at his crotch) a Pretty Huge
s08_e17_c08_u147	All right. (Gets up and walks out.)
s08_e17_c09_u148	(singing) The sun'll come out-tomorrow! Bet-your bottom dollar that tomorrow- (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) -there'll be sun.
s08_e17_c09_u149	(entering) Hey!
s08_e17_c09_u150	Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
s08_e17_c09_u151	Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy's not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
s08_e17_c09_u152	(worried) What?
s08_e17_c09_u153	Let's just say I took care of it.
s08_e17_c09_u154	Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!
s08_e17_c09_u155	Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"
s08_e17_c09_u156	What?!
s08_e17_c09_u157	No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!
s08_e17_c09_u158	What?! Why?!
s08_e17_c09_u159	So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!
s08_e17_c09_u160	And you couldn't think of anything else?!
s08_e17_c09_u161	You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
s08_e17_c09_u162	(To Joey) I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
s08_e17_c09_u163	You can always sell your baby.
s08_e17_c09_u164	Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm gonna get fired!
s08_e17_c09_u165	You lied to me!
s08_e17_c09_u166	Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
s08_e17_c09_u167	Chandler has two copies of Annie!
s08_e17_c10_u168	(seeing Ross) Oh my God! Ross!!!
s08_e17_c10_u169	Hello!!
s08_e17_c10_u170	Ross, what are you doing?!
s08_e17_c10_u171	Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
s08_e17_c11_u172	Morning. You wanted to see me?
s08_e17_c11_u173	Please, come in. Have a seat. (She does so.)
s08_e17_c11_u174	Okay look Mr. Zelner
s08_e17_c11_u175	Oh I think it's best that I speak first.
s08_e17_c11_u176	Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)
s08_e17_c11_u177	I've asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
s08_e17_c11_u178	Oh God.
s08_e17_c11_u179	If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby-I am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
s08_e17_c11_u180	Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)
s08_e17_c12_u181	Oh there it is.
s08_e17_c12_u182	That's not your regular dry cleaners.
s08_e17_c12_u183	I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
s08_e17_c12_u184	What?!
s08_e17_c12_u185	A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.
s08_e17_c12_u186	Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
s08_e17_c12_u187	Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
s08_e17_c12_u188	Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
s08_e17_c12_u189	Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I'm-I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)
s08_e17_c12_u190	Okay.
s08_e17_c12_u191	(To Phoebe) Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s-(looks at Phoebe.) Wow!
s08_e17_c12_u192	What?
s08_e17_c12_u193	I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
s08_e17_c12_u194	Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
s08_e17_c12_u195	I hope you don't think I'm crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
s08_e17_c12_u196	A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now you're talking.
s08_e17_c12_u197	Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
s08_e17_c12_u198	I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.
s08_e17_c12_u199	(to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
s08_e17_c12_u200	(looking around) She must've left.
s08_e17_c13_u201	Hi.
s08_e17_c13_u202	So? What-what-what happened?
s08_e17_c13_u203	It's all gonna be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
s08_e17_c13_u204	Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.
s08_e17_c13_u205	Chandler, can you give us a minute?
s08_e17_c13_u206	Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?
s08_e17_c13_u207	Yeah.
s08_e17_c13_u208	I'll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
s08_e17_c13_u209	Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things
s08_e17_c13_u210	I know. I know.
s08_e17_c13_u211	It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.
s08_e17_c13_u212	Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.
s08_e17_c13_u213	Yeah I know! I miss that.
s08_e17_c13_u214	Me too. I mean I-haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
s08_e17_c13_u215	My gynecologist tried to kill me.
s08_e17_c14_u216	(on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (There's a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in. (She does so.) I'm so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I'm really sorry. It's just that I- (He picks up the pink shirt.)
s08_e17_c14_u217	(interrupting him) Listen Ross, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
s08_e17_c14_u218	You do?
s08_e17_c14_u219	Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just- It just wasn't meant to be.
s08_e17_c14_u220	(faking starting to cry) Oh God you're right.
s08_e17_c14_u221	Ross, we-we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go. (She picks up the shirt Ross has just set down.) Can I? To remember you?
s08_e17_c14_u222	(laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)
s01_e09_c01_u001	Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
s01_e09_c01_u002	An advance?
s01_e09_c01_u003	It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
s01_e09_c01_u004	Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
s01_e09_c01_u005	Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.
s01_e09_c02_u006	Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
s01_e09_c02_u007	Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go.
s01_e09_c02_u008	Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
s01_e09_c02_u009	No, they're not.
s01_e09_c02_u010	Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
s01_e09_c02_u011	You're wrong.
s01_e09_c02_u012	I am not wrong.
s01_e09_c02_u013	You're wrong.
s01_e09_c02_u014	No, I just talked to them.
s01_e09_c02_u015	(getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.
s01_e09_c02_u016	Hey, hey.
s01_e09_c02_u017	Hey.
s01_e09_c02_u018	Hey.
s01_e09_c02_u019	And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
s01_e09_c02_u020	Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
s01_e09_c02_u021	That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
s01_e09_c02_u022	What were you modeling for?
s01_e09_c02_u023	You know those posters for the city free clinic?
s01_e09_c02_u024	Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
s01_e09_c02_u025	You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
s01_e09_c02_u026	Do you know which one you're gonna be?
s01_e09_c02_u027	No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)
s01_e09_c02_u028	Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
s01_e09_c02_u029	Thanks.
s01_e09_c02_u030	(to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
s01_e09_c02_u031	Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
s01_e09_c02_u032	Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
s01_e09_c02_u033	You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
s01_e09_c02_u034	Yeah.
s01_e09_c02_u035	And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
s01_e09_c02_u036	Yes, every single one of them.
s01_e09_c02_u037	Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
s01_e09_c02_u038	Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
s01_e09_c02_u039	So you're free Thursday, then.
s01_e09_c02_u040	Yeah. Oh, can I come?
s01_e09_c02_u041	Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
s01_e09_c02_u042	Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
s01_e09_c02_u043	I thought it was $98.50.
s01_e09_c02_u044	Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
s01_e09_c02_u045	Well, I'm off to Carol's.
s01_e09_c02_u046	Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
s01_e09_c02_u047	(mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
s01_e09_c03_u048	Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
s01_e09_c03_u049	No, she's at a faculty meeting.
s01_e09_c03_u050	Ross: Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
s01_e09_c03_u051	Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
s01_e09_c03_u052	What's it look like?
s01_e09_c03_u053	Kinda like a big face without skin.
s01_e09_c03_u054	Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
s01_e09_c03_u055	Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
s01_e09_c03_u056	Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
s01_e09_c03_u057	(picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
s01_e09_c03_u058	Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
s01_e09_c03_u059	The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
s01_e09_c03_u060	What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
s01_e09_c03_u061	You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
s01_e09_c03_u062	Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
s01_e09_c03_u063	Do you uh, do you talk about me?
s01_e09_c03_u064	Yeah, yeah, all the time.
s01_e09_c03_u065	Really?
s01_e09_c03_u066	But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
s01_e09_c04_u067	Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
s01_e09_c04_u068	Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
s01_e09_c04_u069	I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
s01_e09_c04_u070	Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
s01_e09_c04_u071	No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
s01_e09_c04_u072	Rach, here's your mail.
s01_e09_c04_u073	Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
s01_e09_c04_u074	(insistently) No, here's your mail.
s01_e09_c04_u075	Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
s01_e09_c04_u076	(gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
s01_e09_c04_u077	Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
s01_e09_c04_u078	We all chipped in.
s01_e09_c04_u079	(to Monica) We did?
s01_e09_c04_u080	(to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
s01_e09_c04_u081	Thank you. Thank you so much!
s01_e09_c04_u082	(hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
s01_e09_c04_u083	Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
s01_e09_c04_u084	All right, I'm nine years old.
s01_e09_c04_u085	Oh, I hate this story.
s01_e09_c04_u086	We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
s01_e09_c04_u087	Oh my god.
s01_e09_c04_u088	Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
s01_e09_c05_u089	Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
s01_e09_c05_u090	Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?
s01_e09_c05_u091	I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
s01_e09_c05_u092	I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
s01_e09_c05_u093	Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
s01_e09_c05_u094	Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
s01_e09_c05_u095	What's wrong?
s01_e09_c05_u096	Oh. What?
s01_e09_c05_u097	Wait, wait, wait!
s01_e09_c06_u098	So I guess you all saw it.
s01_e09_c06_u099	Saw what?
s01_e09_c06_u100	No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
s01_e09_c07_u101	Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
s01_e09_c07_u102	Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
s01_e09_c08_u103	Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?
s01_e09_c08_u104	I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
s01_e09_c08_u105	All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
s01_e09_c08_u106	That's closer.
s01_e09_c08_u107	I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
s01_e09_c08_u108	Oh, you must stop shooping.
s01_e09_c08_u109	Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
s01_e09_c08_u110	Chandler, will you just come in already?
s01_e09_c08_u111	No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
s01_e09_c08_u112	Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
s01_e09_c08_u113	Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
s01_e09_c08_u114	Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
s01_e09_c08_u115	That's not a question.
s01_e09_c08_u116	But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
s01_e09_c08_u117	All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
s01_e09_c08_u118	Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
s01_e09_c08_u119	Ah!
s01_e09_c08_u120	Ok, Mom never hit.
s01_e09_c08_u121	(stirring pot) Ok, all done.
s01_e09_c08_u122	What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
s01_e09_c08_u123	Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
s01_e09_c08_u124	Why would we do that?
s01_e09_c08_u125	Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
s01_e09_c08_u126	Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
s01_e09_c08_u127	Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
s01_e09_c08_u128	The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
s01_e09_c08_u129	The balloon?
s01_e09_c08_u130	No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
s01_e09_c08_u131	I can't, I gotta go.
s01_e09_c08_u132	Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
s01_e09_c08_u133	Almost never.
s01_e09_c08_u134	Got the keys? or Got the keys!
s01_e09_c08_u135	Ok.
s01_e09_c09_u136	Anytime you're ready.
s01_e09_c09_u137	Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
s01_e09_c09_u138	Just aim for the bump.
s01_e09_c09_u139	Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
s01_e09_c09_u140	So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
s01_e09_c09_u141	(quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
s01_e09_c10_u142	I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
s01_e09_c10_u143	Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
s01_e09_c10_u144	Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
s01_e09_c10_u145	We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
s01_e09_c10_u146	No I don't.
s01_e09_c10_u147	Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."
s01_e09_c10_u148	No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
s01_e09_c10_u149	No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
s01_e09_c10_u150	Do either of you have the keys?
s01_e09_c10_u151	(panicked) The oven is on.
s01_e09_c10_u152	Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
s01_e09_c10_u153	Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
s01_e09_c10_u154	Well then get it, get it!
s01_e09_c10_u155	That tone will not make me go any faster.
s01_e09_c10_u156	(angry) Joey!
s01_e09_c10_u157	That one will.
s01_e09_c11_u158	And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
s01_e09_c11_u159	Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
s01_e09_c11_u160	Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
s01_e09_c11_u161	Hi, how's it goin?
s01_e09_c11_u162	Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
s01_e09_c11_u163	I did.
s01_e09_c11_u164	Does it always, uh--?
s01_e09_c11_u165	No, no that was the first.
s01_e09_c11_u166	Keep singing! Keep singing!
s01_e09_c11_u167	(singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
s01_e09_c11_u168	I felt it!
s01_e09_c11_u169	(singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
s01_e09_c12_u170	Nope, not that one.
s01_e09_c12_u171	Can you go any faster with that?
s01_e09_c12_u172	Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
s01_e09_c12_u173	Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
s01_e09_c12_u174	(sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
s01_e09_c12_u175	(grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.
s01_e09_c12_u176	I swear you said you had the keys.
s01_e09_c12_u177	No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
s01_e09_c12_u178	Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
s01_e09_c12_u179	Why would I have the keys?
s01_e09_c12_u180	Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
s01_e09_c12_u181	But I didn't.
s01_e09_c12_u182	Well, you should have.
s01_e09_c12_u183	Why?
s01_e09_c12_u184	Because!
s01_e09_c12_u185	Why?
s01_e09_c12_u186	Because!
s01_e09_c12_u187	Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
s01_e09_c12_u188	Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
s01_e09_c12_u189	Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
s01_e09_c12_u190	Here we come, walkin' down the-this doesn't smell like Mom's.
s01_e09_c12_u191	No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
s01_e09_c12_u192	Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
s01_e09_c12_u193	Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
s01_e09_c12_u194	Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
s01_e09_c12_u195	You call that delicious?
s01_e09_c12_u196	Stop it, stop it, stop it!
s01_e09_c12_u197	Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
s01_e09_c12_u198	Ooh.
s01_e09_c12_u199	What?
s01_e09_c12_u200	Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
s01_e09_c12_u201	I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
s01_e09_c12_u202	Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
s01_e09_c12_u203	It's nice that he has someone.
s01_e09_c12_u204	Shall I carve?
s01_e09_c12_u205	By all means.
s01_e09_c12_u206	Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
s01_e09_c12_u207	I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
s01_e09_c12_u208	(holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
s01_e09_c12_u209	Oh, I will.
s01_e09_c12_u210	Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
s01_e09_c12_u211	Make a wish?
s01_e09_c12_u212	Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
s01_e09_c12_u213	The bigger half.
s01_e09_c12_u214	I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
s01_e09_c12_u215	That's so sweet.
s01_e09_c12_u216	And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
s01_e09_c12_u217	And a crappy New Year.
s01_e09_c12_u218	Here, here!
s09_e12_c01_u001	Hey
s09_e12_c01_u002	Hey. So where's Mon?
s09_e12_c01_u003	Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
s09_e12_c01_u004	And you're not helping?
s09_e12_c01_u005	I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
s09_e12_c01_u006	Hey you guys!
s09_e12_c01_u007	(start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...
s09_e12_c01_u008	Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
s09_e12_c01_u009	Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey.
s09_e12_c01_u010	Hi.
s09_e12_c01_u011	Hi.
s09_e12_c01_u012	Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
s09_e12_c01_u013	You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
s09_e12_c01_u014	Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
s09_e12_c01_u015	No, you stay, I'll do it (takes Emma from Rachel).
s09_e12_c01_u016	OK, thank you.
s09_e12_c01_u017	Nice to meet you guys (to Chandler and Joey).
s09_e12_c01_u018	Yeah, you too.
s09_e12_c01_u019	Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
s09_e12_c01_u020	Yeah.
s09_e12_c01_u021	Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.
s09_e12_c01_u022	What? You really think she's hot?
s09_e12_c01_u023	Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
s09_e12_c01_u024	And Joey?
s09_e12_c01_u025	How do you think she's doing?
s09_e12_c01_u026	Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
s09_e12_c01_u027	Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
s09_e12_c01_u028	Thank you! (goes to get coffee)
s09_e12_c01_u029	Now that Rachel's gone?
s09_e12_c01_u030	So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their hands)
s09_e12_c02_u031	Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
s09_e12_c02_u032	Lima.
s09_e12_c02_u033	No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
s09_e12_c02_u034	You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox". (opens the kitchen cabinet) Oh god! Oh!
s09_e12_c02_u035	What?
s09_e12_c02_u036	OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
s09_e12_c02_u037	(relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.
s09_e12_c02_u038	What, is he your pet rat?
s09_e12_c02_u039	Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
s09_e12_c02_u040	You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
s09_e12_c02_u041	What are those?
s09_e12_c02_u042	I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!
s09_e12_c02_u043	OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
s09_e12_c02_u044	Thank you.
s09_e12_c02_u045	So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)
s09_e12_c03_u046	Hello.
s09_e12_c03_u047	Hello
s09_e12_c03_u048	Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
s09_e12_c03_u049	For what?
s09_e12_c03_u050	Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
s09_e12_c03_u051	Is this your first appology?
s09_e12_c03_u052	No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
s09_e12_c03_u053	Good morning!
s09_e12_c03_u054	Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.
s09_e12_c03_u055	What?
s09_e12_c03_u056	I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
s09_e12_c03_u057	I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
s09_e12_c03_u058	Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.
s09_e12_c03_u059	Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
s09_e12_c03_u060	Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.
s09_e12_c03_u061	I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
s09_e12_c03_u062	That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.
s09_e12_c03_u063	Huh. What's Tag's last name?
s09_e12_c03_u064	It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.
s09_e12_c03_u065	But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
s09_e12_c03_u066	Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!
s09_e12_c03_u067	It was Jones.
s09_e12_c03_u068	Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
s09_e12_c04_u069	Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
s09_e12_c04_u070	You mean, when you were a baby.
s09_e12_c04_u071	Sure.
s09_e12_c04_u072	Would you stop staring at her?
s09_e12_c04_u073	I wasn't staring. I was leering.
s09_e12_c04_u074	What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
s09_e12_c04_u075	Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
s09_e12_c04_u076	Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
s09_e12_c04_u077	Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
s09_e12_c04_u078	(to Ross) I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
s09_e12_c04_u079	Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...
s09_e12_c04_u080	Bye
s09_e12_c04_u081	They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
s09_e12_c04_u082	I think it's sweet. (goes to leave)
s09_e12_c04_u083	Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
s09_e12_c04_u084	(to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
s09_e12_c04_u085	Why not?
s09_e12_c04_u086	Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
s09_e12_c04_u087	So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds about right.
s09_e12_c04_u088	Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
s09_e12_c04_u089	Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
s09_e12_c04_u090	What are you, a child?
s09_e12_c04_u091	Yes!
s09_e12_c04_u092	Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
s09_e12_c04_u093	Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)
s09_e12_c04_u094	(to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)
s09_e12_c05_u095	Hey Mikey
s09_e12_c05_u096	Hey P
s09_e12_c05_u097	What are you doing?
s09_e12_c05_u098	Setting rat traps.
s09_e12_c05_u099	To kill Bob??
s09_e12_c05_u100	No, no, to test his neck strength.
s09_e12_c05_u101	No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
s09_e12_c05_u102	Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
s09_e12_c05_u103	I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
s09_e12_c05_u104	Better think of a new name for him.
s09_e12_c05_u105	I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
s09_e12_c05_u106	I don't know, I mean I'm not sure (they hear cracking voice from somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ...
s09_e12_c05_u107	Oh my god, we killed Bob!
s09_e12_c05_u108	Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
s09_e12_c05_u109	Suzie? (Runs over there to check)
s09_e12_c06_u110	Whazzup??
s09_e12_c06_u111	Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
s09_e12_c06_u112	Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
s09_e12_c06_u113	You don't trust him?
s09_e12_c06_u114	Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
s09_e12_c06_u115	Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
s09_e12_c06_u116	You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
s09_e12_c06_u117	Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
s09_e12_c06_u118	Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause)
s09_e12_c06_u119	Picturing that tree?
s09_e12_c06_u120	I am, yes.
s09_e12_c07_u121	Where you going, Joe?
s09_e12_c07_u122	For a walk.
s09_e12_c07_u123	Oh. You mind if I join you?
s09_e12_c07_u124	Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
s09_e12_c07_u125	Your thoughts? Plural?
s09_e12_c07_u126	Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
s09_e12_c07_u127	I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
s09_e12_c07_u128	Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
s09_e12_c07_u129	Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
s09_e12_c07_u130	Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
s09_e12_c07_u131	Great novels?
s09_e12_c07_u132	Fine ... mediocre porn
s09_e12_c08_u133	Gavin Mitchelle's office.
s09_e12_c08_u134	Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)
s09_e12_c08_u135	Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary. (Rachel is upset)
s09_e12_c08_u136	Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
s09_e12_c08_u137	Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. (hangs up) (to Rachel) Yes?
s09_e12_c08_u138	If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
s09_e12_c08_u139	Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago. (Rachel throws away that paper) Man, I really bug you, don't I?
s09_e12_c08_u140	Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
s09_e12_c08_u141	Hey Rach!
s09_e12_c08_u142	Hi!
s09_e12_c08_u143	Ready for your birthday lunch?
s09_e12_c08_u144	Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
s09_e12_c08_u145	Pleased to meet you.
s09_e12_c08_u146	Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
s09_e12_c08_u147	Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.
s09_e12_c08_u148	Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday. (leaves)
s09_e12_c08_u149	Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
s09_e12_c08_u150	You were just being so nice to him!
s09_e12_c08_u151	I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
s09_e12_c08_u152	Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
s09_e12_c08_u153	Right there! That was so fake!
s09_e12_c08_u154	Shh!
s09_e12_c09_u155	(to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.
s09_e12_c09_u156	Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
s09_e12_c09_u157	God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.
s09_e12_c09_u158	Does he?
s09_e12_c09_u159	What?
s09_e12_c09_u160	Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
s09_e12_c09_u161	Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
s09_e12_c09_u162	(with Emma in a basinet) She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
s09_e12_c09_u163	Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys see in her?
s09_e12_c09_u164	Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)
s09_e12_c09_u165	Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
s09_e12_c09_u166	Yeah, sure!
s09_e12_c09_u167	Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you later (runs after Molly)
s09_e12_c09_u168	Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
s09_e12_c09_u169	Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)
s09_e12_c09_u170	Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
s09_e12_c09_u171	Yeah. We have rat babies now.
s09_e12_c09_u172	Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
s09_e12_c09_u173	So this is what a stroke feels like.
s09_e12_c09_u174	I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
s09_e12_c09_u175	Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
s09_e12_c09_u176	No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
s09_e12_c09_u177	whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
s09_e12_c09_u178	Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. (she and Mike leave)
s09_e12_c09_u179	Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
s09_e12_c09_u180	(In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
s09_e12_c09_u181	We have to stop them before something happens!
s09_e12_c09_u182	(still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)
s09_e12_c10_u183	So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
s09_e12_c10_u184	So where did you study?
s09_e12_c10_u185	Oh, I didn't go to college.
s09_e12_c10_u186	No, where did you study acting?
s09_e12_c10_u187	Molly ... people don't study acting ...
s09_e12_c10_u188	Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
s09_e12_c10_u189	Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
s09_e12_c10_u190	Thanx.
s09_e12_c10_u191	(upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??
s09_e12_c10_u192	What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
s09_e12_c10_u193	No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
s09_e12_c10_u194	Come on! Joe!
s09_e12_c10_u195	Ok (admits)
s09_e12_c10_u196	Hi, is Molly here?
s09_e12_c10_u197	Yeah, come on in. Molly?
s09_e12_c10_u198	(goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss on the lips in a romantic way). (to Ross) I'll see you tomorrow.
s09_e12_c10_u199	Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
s09_e12_c10_u200	It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
s09_e12_c11_u201	Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
s09_e12_c11_u202	Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?
s09_e12_c11_u203	Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.
s09_e12_c11_u204	Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
s09_e12_c11_u205	Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
s09_e12_c11_u206	Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.
s09_e12_c11_u207	No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
s09_e12_c11_u208	Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
s09_e12_c11_u209	Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.
s09_e12_c11_u210	It's gonna be ok.
s09_e12_c11_u211	You must think I'm crazy.
s09_e12_c11_u212	No, I think you're sweet.
s09_e12_c11_u213	Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't told you about that yet, have I?
s09_e12_c12_u214	Hey!
s09_e12_c12_u215	Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
s09_e12_c12_u216	No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?
s09_e12_c12_u217	Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
s09_e12_c12_u218	Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).
s09_e12_c12_u219	Mmm hmm.
s09_e12_c12_u220	Yeah, hey. (comes in to the balcony)
s09_e12_c12_u221	Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.
s09_e12_c12_u222	No.
s09_e12_c12_u223	Nice party.
s09_e12_c12_u224	Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...
s09_e12_c12_u225	(from inside) Again, you're welcome.
s09_e12_c12_u226	Look, I'll just give you this and go.
s09_e12_c12_u227	Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
s09_e12_c12_u228	Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.
s09_e12_c12_u229	Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens the card). "From Gavin"
s09_e12_c12_u230	I really mean it.
s09_e12_c12_u231	(opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
s09_e12_c12_u232	You don't mind? (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, it fits!
s09_e12_c12_u233	See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
s09_e12_c12_u234	I'm not sure.
s09_e12_c12_u235	Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
s09_e12_c12_u236	I do have feelings for you.
s09_e12_c12_u237	You do?
s09_e12_c12_u238	Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
s09_e12_c12_u239	See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)
s09_e12_c12_u240	(sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)
s09_e12_c12_u241	(walks in) Hey
s09_e12_c12_u242	(normal voice) Hi
s09_e12_c12_u243	Listen, I think I've left something here.
s09_e12_c12_u244	Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?
s09_e12_c12_u245	(likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
s09_e12_c12_u246	Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
s09_e12_c12_u247	Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)
s09_e12_c12_u248	(realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!
s05_e02_c01_u001	You look cute in bubbles.
s05_e02_c01_u002	Ehh, you're just liquored up.
s05_e02_c01_u003	Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
s05_e02_c01_u004	I've had a very long, hard day.
s05_e02_c01_u005	Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
s05_e02_c01_u006	Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
s05_e02_c01_u007	Okay.
s05_e02_c01_u008	You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
s05_e02_c01_u009	For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
s05_e02_c01_u010	All right!
s05_e02_c01_u011	Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
s05_e02_c01_u012	Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
s05_e02_c01_u013	Hey Joe!
s05_e02_c01_u014	Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
s05_e02_c02_u015	(entering) Hey!
s05_e02_c02_u016	Hey, Pheebs!
s05_e02_c02_u017	Mornin' Pheebs!
s05_e02_c02_u018	I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver
s05_e02_c02_u019	(interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)
s05_e02_c02_u020	What?
s05_e02_c02_u021	Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
s05_e02_c02_u022	Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway
s05_e02_c02_u023	Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
s05_e02_c02_u024	Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
s05_e02_c02_u025	Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh
s05_e02_c02_u026	Bodington's!
s05_e02_c02_u027	Bodington's! Woohoo! (And they all high-five each other.)
s05_e02_c02_u028	Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
s05_e02_c02_u029	Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it.
s05_e02_c02_u030	(entering) Hey!
s05_e02_c02_u031	Hey!
s05_e02_c02_u032	Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
s05_e02_c02_u033	Yeah! (They high-five.)
s05_e02_c02_u034	That was good beer.
s05_e02_c02_u035	Ohh
s05_e02_c02_u036	Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
s05_e02_c02_u037	Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
s05_e02_c02_u038	Later! (Exits.)
s05_e02_c02_u039	Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
s05_e02_c02_u040	Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch) she should be here by now.
s05_e02_c02_u041	Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
s05_e02_c02_u042	No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
s05_e02_c02_u043	Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
s05_e02_c02_u044	So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
s05_e02_c02_u045	No, not since I lost her at the airport.
s05_e02_c02_u046	I can't believe she can out run you man!
s05_e02_c02_u047	HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
s05_e02_c02_u048	(entering) Hi!
s05_e02_c02_u049	Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)
s05_e02_c02_u050	Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
s05_e02_c02_u051	Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
s05_e02_c02_u052	That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
s05_e02_c02_u053	Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)
s05_e02_c02_u054	So, what? That's it?
s05_e02_c02_u055	Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
s05_e02_c02_u056	Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)
s05_e02_c02_u057	Oh no, you're the best.
s05_e02_c02_u058	(breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
s05_e02_c02_u059	Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
s05_e02_c02_u060	Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
s05_e02_c02_u061	What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
s05_e02_c02_u062	Oh that's not true.
s05_e02_c02_u063	Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
s05_e02_c02_u064	London is stupid! Stupid!
s05_e02_c02_u065	Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
s05_e02_c02_u066	Oh- No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
s05_e02_c02_u067	I'll do it!
s05_e02_c02_u068	That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
s05_e02_c02_u069	Okay, I gotta go to work.
s05_e02_c02_u070	And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
s05_e02_c02_u071	Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
s05_e02_c03_u072	Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
s05_e02_c03_u073	Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)
s05_e02_c03_u074	Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
s05_e02_c03_u075	I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of the pictures)
s05_e02_c03_u076	Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)
s05_e02_c03_u077	I mean it's my fault.
s05_e02_c03_u078	Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
s05_e02_c03_u079	Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)
s05_e02_c03_u080	Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
s05_e02_c03_u081	(To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.
s05_e02_c03_u082	If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
s05_e02_c03_u083	Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda
s05_e02_c03_u084	(Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
s05_e02_c03_u085	Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
s05_e02_c03_u086	You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
s05_e02_c03_u087	All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
s05_e02_c03_u088	Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)
s05_e02_c03_u089	(entering) Hey!
s05_e02_c03_u090	Hey!
s05_e02_c03_u091	Hey, Pheebs!
s05_e02_c03_u092	We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
s05_e02_c03_u093	(Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't watch.)
s05_e02_c03_u094	All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
s05_e02_c03_u095	No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
s05_e02_c03_u096	Sorry.
s05_e02_c03_u097	What happened?
s05_e02_c03_u098	Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
s05_e02_c03_u099	See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
s05_e02_c03_u100	Well
s05_e02_c03_u101	(To the guy) Get out!
s05_e02_c04_u102	What took you so long?
s05_e02_c04_u103	I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
s05_e02_c04_u104	Oh, good.
s05_e02_c04_u105	So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)
s05_e02_c04_u106	(Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!
s05_e02_c04_u107	Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
s05_e02_c04_u108	That's not European!
s05_e02_c04_u109	Well, it felt French.
s05_e02_c05_u110	Oh God, I really had a good time!
s05_e02_c05_u111	Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it.
s05_e02_c05_u112	Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
s05_e02_c05_u113	Yeah!
s05_e02_c05_u114	Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
s05_e02_c05_u115	Okay, yeah!
s05_e02_c05_u116	Umm, hi!
s05_e02_c05_u117	Hi.
s05_e02_c05_u118	Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
s05_e02_c05_u119	She's doing her laundry.
s05_e02_c05_u120	What's that? (Points to the box.)
s05_e02_c05_u121	It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
s05_e02_c05_u122	Oh, honey that's awful.
s05_e02_c05_u123	Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
s05_e02_c05_u124	But, it's not raining.
s05_e02_c05_u125	I can't catch a break!
s05_e02_c05_u126	Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!
s05_e02_c05_u127	Yeah?
s05_e02_c05_u128	Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
s05_e02_c05_u129	(Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
s05_e02_c05_u130	Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the dropped socks.)
s05_e02_c05_u131	What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
s05_e02_c05_u132	Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
s05_e02_c05_u133	I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
s05_e02_c05_u134	Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted-tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
s05_e02_c05_u135	(Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
s05_e02_c05_u136	Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
s05_e02_c05_u137	I make the decisions, and I say no.
s05_e02_c05_u138	Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
s05_e02_c05_u139	You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
s05_e02_c05_u140	Well- (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)
s05_e02_c05_u141	Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
s05_e02_c05_u142	(Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?
s05_e02_c05_u143	Rachel locked the door.
s05_e02_c05_u144	I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
s05_e02_c06_u145	Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
s05_e02_c06_u146	Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
s05_e02_c06_u147	No.
s05_e02_c06_u148	I really need to talk to you.
s05_e02_c06_u149	Well, then talk!
s05_e02_c06_u150	Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
s05_e02_c06_u151	Yes!
s05_e02_c06_u152	What thing?
s05_e02_c06_u153	Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.
s05_e02_c06_u154	Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My God, think of the massacre.
s05_e02_c06_u155	I'm gonna do it.
s05_e02_c06_u156	All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
s05_e02_c06_u157	But I
s05_e02_c06_u158	Please!
s05_e02_c06_u159	All right, fine.
s05_e02_c06_u160	Joey, I'm in!
s05_e02_c06_u161	(In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.
s05_e02_c07_u162	Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
s05_e02_c07_u163	Uh, okay, Pheebs?
s05_e02_c07_u164	Yeah?
s05_e02_c07_u165	Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
s05_e02_c07_u166	Yeah?
s05_e02_c07_u167	All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
s05_e02_c07_u168	Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
s05_e02_c07_u169	Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central Park!
s05_e02_c07_u170	(excited) Central-(not so excited) Park!
s05_e02_c07_u171	Yeah, all of us! All day!
s05_e02_c07_u172	That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
s05_e02_c07_u173	Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)
s05_e02_c07_u174	(stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
s05_e02_c07_u175	I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
s05_e02_c07_u176	That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
s05_e02_c07_u177	Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)
s05_e02_c08_u178	Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
s05_e02_c08_u179	Phoebe!
s05_e02_c08_u180	Hey, Pheebs!
s05_e02_c08_u181	Phoebe, woo!
s05_e02_c08_u182	Okay, woo! Hi.
s05_e02_c08_u183	Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little- Y'know, it didn't have any- It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
s05_e02_c08_u184	Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
s05_e02_c08_u185	Mine!
s05_e02_c08_u186	Wait! It was my plan.
s05_e02_c08_u187	Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
s05_e02_c08_u188	And, I came up with Atlantic City.
s05_e02_c08_u189	Which, is the new plan!
s05_e02_c08_u190	Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
s05_e02_c08_u191	Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
s05_e02_c08_u192	Come on Rach, let's go.
s05_e02_c08_u193	Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
s05_e02_c08_u194	No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
s05_e02_c08_u195	Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
s05_e02_c08_u196	Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
s05_e02_c08_u197	Yeah, I-I don't care.
s05_e02_c08_u198	Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)
s05_e02_c08_u199	What 'cha readin'?
s05_e02_c08_u200	The paper.
s05_e02_c08_u201	Yeah, what's it about?
s05_e02_c08_u202	Events from around the globe.
s05_e02_c08_u203	Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
s05_e02_c08_u204	Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized
s05_e02_c08_u205	Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
s05_e02_c08_u206	Yeah.
s05_e02_c08_u207	Okay.
s05_e02_c08_u208	Go ahead.
s05_e02_c08_u209	Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.
s05_e02_c08_u210	Wow. Umm- Huh- I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
s05_e02_c08_u211	What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
s05_e02_c08_u212	(Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
s05_e02_c08_u213	Why are you laughing?
s05_e02_c08_u214	Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like, "You are such an idiot!"
s05_e02_c08_u215	Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
s05_e02_c08_u216	(laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.
s05_e02_c08_u217	Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. (Laughs) "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
s05_e02_c08_u218	Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
s05_e02_c08_u219	Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is
s05_e02_c08_u220	The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
s05_e02_c08_u221	That is what the thing is.
s05_e02_c08_u222	Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
s05_e02_c08_u223	No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
s05_e02_c08_u224	That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)
s05_e02_c08_u225	No thank you for- Thank you.
s05_e02_c09_u226	Okay, let's go!
s05_e02_c09_u227	Atlantic City!
s05_e02_c09_u228	Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
s05_e02_c09_u229	Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
s05_e02_c09_u230	Oh my God! You're water broke!
s05_e02_c09_u231	Ohh!
s05_e02_c09_u232	All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)
s05_e02_c09_u233	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
s05_e02_c09_u234	Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
s05_e02_c09_u235	Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
s05_e02_c09_u236	High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)
s05_e02_c09_u237	Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)
s05_e02_c10_u238	I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
s05_e02_c10_u239	I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
s05_e02_c10_u240	Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
s05_e02_c10_u241	Do you know anything about women?
s05_e02_c10_u242	No.
s05_e02_c10_u243	That's all right.
s05_e02_c10_u244	Okay. (They kiss again.)
s05_e03_c01_u001	(to the nurse) Hi.
s05_e03_c01_u002	Hi.
s05_e03_c01_u003	Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
s05_e03_c01_u004	Okay. Have you started having contractions?
s05_e03_c01_u005	Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
s05_e03_c01_u006	Well
s05_e03_c01_u007	Oh my God!
s05_e03_c01_u008	It's all right.
s05_e03_c01_u009	Now, which of you is the father? (Points to Joey and Ross)
s05_e03_c01_u010	Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
s05_e03_c01_u011	(not sure what to do with that) Okay
s05_e03_c01_u012	I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
s05_e03_c01_u013	Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
s05_e03_c01_u014	Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
s05_e03_c01_u015	Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
s05_e03_c01_u016	Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
s05_e03_c01_u017	That's right.
s05_e03_c01_u018	You-you're not wearing a jacket.
s05_e03_c01_u019	Oh man! I did it again!
s05_e03_c01_u020	(standing up) Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. (As she is talking Joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) And then my mom wants to know-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing?!
s05_e03_c01_u021	I gotta get the before shot!
s05_e03_c02_u022	Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
s05_e03_c02_u023	What?!
s05_e03_c02_u024	Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
s05_e03_c02_u025	Oh my God, she's so stupid!
s05_e03_c02_u026	Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
s05_e03_c02_u027	That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
s05_e03_c02_u028	Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
s05_e03_c02_u029	Yeah, he's head of the department.
s05_e03_c02_u030	All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
s05_e03_c02_u031	What?
s05_e03_c02_u032	I'm having my first contraction!
s05_e03_c02_u033	Oh no.
s05_e03_c02_u034	Ooh, it's not bad.
s05_e03_c02_u035	Okay.
s05_e03_c02_u036	Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)
s05_e03_c02_u037	Hey! You okay?
s05_e03_c02_u038	Ooh, something hurts!
s05_e03_c02_u039	Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
s05_e03_c02_u040	Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
s05_e03_c02_u041	Hello.
s05_e03_c02_u042	Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie. (Exits)
s05_e03_c02_u043	Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
s05_e03_c02_u044	That's what it sounded like.
s05_e03_c02_u045	All right
s05_e03_c02_u046	(entering) Hey!
s05_e03_c02_u047	Hey!
s05_e03_c02_u048	(To Phoebe) Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
s05_e03_c02_u049	No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
s05_e03_c02_u050	Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
s05_e03_c02_u051	Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
s05_e03_c02_u052	Yeah.
s05_e03_c03_u053	(entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
s05_e03_c03_u054	Oh my!
s05_e03_c03_u055	They're male nurses.
s05_e03_c03_u056	Not in my head.
s05_e03_c03_u057	Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
s05_e03_c03_u058	Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
s05_e03_c03_u059	What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
s05_e03_c03_u060	Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
s05_e03_c03_u061	What?
s05_e03_c03_u062	Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
s05_e03_c03_u063	Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
s05_e03_c03_u064	(in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O
s05_e03_c03_u065	Joey, how do you make that dirty?
s05_e03_c03_u066	Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his fingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad
s05_e03_c04_u067	(entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USA Today and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies- (Throws the paper away to reveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera in it.)
s05_e03_c04_u068	Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
s05_e03_c04_u069	Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
s05_e03_c04_u070	Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
s05_e03_c04_u071	Really? Male nurses?
s05_e03_c04_u072	Yeah, I was bummed too.
s05_e03_c04_u073	So they're going on dates? When?
s05_e03_c04_u074	I think Saturday-(groans in pain again).
s05_e03_c04_u075	(To Phoebe) What's with him?
s05_e03_c04_u076	Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
s05_e03_c04_u077	(entering) Okay!
s05_e03_c04_u078	Hey.
s05_e03_c04_u079	Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
s05_e03_c04_u080	This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
s05_e03_c04_u081	Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
s05_e03_c04_u082	All right.
s05_e03_c04_u083	It's not that weird, is it?
s05_e03_c04_u084	It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
s05_e03_c04_u085	To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie
s05_e03_c04_u086	(interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
s05_e03_c04_u087	Again, it's not that he
s05_e03_c05_u088	(spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
s05_e03_c05_u089	Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
s05_e03_c05_u090	Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
s05_e03_c05_u091	Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
s05_e03_c05_u092	Fine! Maybe I will too!
s05_e03_c05_u093	(entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a wheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)
s05_e03_c06_u094	Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
s05_e03_c06_u095	Hi! And you're going into what grade?
s05_e03_c06_u096	Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early
s05_e03_c06_u097	(interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
s05_e03_c06_u098	Oh no, I'm fully qualified to
s05_e03_c06_u099	Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
s05_e03_c06_u100	Oh cool! You made him cry!
s05_e03_c07_u101	Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
s05_e03_c07_u102	Umm, well, what else could it be?
s05_e03_c07_u103	It's kidney stones.
s05_e03_c07_u104	Or?
s05_e03_c07_u105	Kidney stones!
s05_e03_c08_u106	All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
s05_e03_c08_u107	They are. Why?
s05_e03_c08_u108	They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
s05_e03_c08_u109	Happy birthday!
s05_e03_c08_u110	Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. (Phoebe nods in agreement as he leaves.)
s05_e03_c08_u111	Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
s05_e03_c08_u112	I know, it is.
s05_e03_c08_u113	Yeah!
s05_e03_c08_u114	Can I tell you a little secret?
s05_e03_c08_u115	Yeah!
s05_e03_c08_u116	I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)
s05_e03_c08_u117	Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
s05_e03_c09_u118	Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
s05_e03_c09_u119	Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
s05_e03_c09_u120	Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
s05_e03_c09_u121	Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
s05_e03_c09_u122	Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
s05_e03_c09_u123	Oh, just ask him!
s05_e03_c09_u124	Me?!
s05_e03_c09_u125	I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
s05_e03_c09_u126	No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
s05_e03_c09_u127	You're right.
s05_e03_c09_u128	Tell him it's for you.
s05_e03_c10_u129	Feeling a little better sweetie?
s05_e03_c10_u130	Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
s05_e03_c10_u131	Me too.
s05_e03_c10_u132	(entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?
s05_e03_c10_u133	Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
s05_e03_c10_u134	(interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are you crazy?!
s05_e03_c11_u135	(To Rachel) So did you ask him?
s05_e03_c11_u136	No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
s05_e03_c11_u137	Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
s05_e03_c11_u138	(laughing) Oh Fonzie.
s05_e03_c11_u139	Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
s05_e03_c11_u140	Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
s05_e03_c11_u141	Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
s05_e03_c11_u142	Yeah, but umm- Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
s05_e03_c11_u143	Yeah, that's right.
s05_e03_c11_u144	(entering with Chandler) Hey!
s05_e03_c11_u145	Hi!
s05_e03_c11_u146	(To Phoebe) How are you doing?
s05_e03_c11_u147	Okay, doctor says any minute now.
s05_e03_c11_u148	Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
s05_e03_c11_u149	Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
s05_e03_c11_u150	Hi!
s05_e03_c11_u151	Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. (Mouths "He's yours." to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.
s05_e03_c11_u152	Nice to meet you.
s05_e03_c11_u153	Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!
s05_e03_c11_u154	So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
s05_e03_c11_u155	Chandler!
s05_e03_c11_u156	Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
s05_e03_c11_u157	Oh.
s05_e03_c11_u158	And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.
s05_e03_c11_u159	Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)
s05_e03_c11_u160	So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?
s05_e03_c11_u161	Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
s05_e03_c11_u162	Oh, great!
s05_e03_c11_u163	(to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
s05_e03_c11_u164	Delivery Room Nurse: No.
s05_e03_c11_u165	All right. Very good.
s05_e03_c11_u166	Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!
s05_e03_c11_u167	Ohh, get these things out of me!
s05_e03_c11_u168	Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
s05_e03_c11_u169	I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back and forth, taking Ross with him.)
s05_e03_c11_u170	I do too! I do too!
s05_e03_c11_u171	Argh!
s05_e03_c11_u172	Argh!
s05_e03_c11_u173	Argh!
s05_e03_c11_u174	Argh!
s05_e03_c12_u175	Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye! (To Rachel) Hi!
s05_e03_c12_u176	Hi!
s05_e03_c12_u177	That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
s05_e03_c12_u178	Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.
s05_e03_c12_u179	Yeah.
s05_e03_c12_u180	Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
s05_e03_c12_u181	(laughs) Not to me.
s05_e03_c12_u182	Yeah, fair enough.
s05_e03_c13_u183	Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.
s05_e03_c13_u184	Bye Dan!
s05_e03_c13_u185	Uh, bye Monica.
s05_e03_c13_u186	Bye, momi-moo.
s05_e03_c13_u187	All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.
s05_e03_c13_u188	What is that?
s05_e03_c13_u189	Oh my God!
s05_e03_c13_u190	Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.
s05_e03_c13_u191	Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. (Joey makes a face like he is trying to pee.) Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing. (Points at the bottle Joey is to pee into.)
s05_e03_c13_u192	Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!
s05_e03_c13_u193	I see the head.
s05_e03_c13_u194	Yes, it has a head!
s05_e03_c13_u195	All right. Keep pushing! Come on!
s05_e03_c13_u196	I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
s05_e03_c13_u197	All right. Here's your first baby.
s05_e03_c13_u198	YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!
s05_e03_c13_u199	Yes!
s05_e03_c13_u200	Frank Jr. Jr.!!
s05_e03_c13_u201	Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
s05_e03_c13_u202	So gross! (He runs back to the delivery room.)
s05_e03_c13_u203	Okay. You ready to push again?
s05_e03_c13_u204	I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
s05_e03_c13_u205	Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
s05_e03_c13_u206	Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that? (He returns to the delivery room.)
s05_e03_c13_u207	Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
s05_e03_c13_u208	All right, he's coming. He's coming!
s05_e03_c13_u209	Hey, where's his thing?
s05_e03_c13_u210	Chandler's a girl!
s05_e03_c13_u211	Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
s05_e03_c13_u212	They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
s05_e03_c13_u213	Okay, keep saying it!
s05_e03_c13_u214	(running in from the elevator) Am I too late?!
s05_e03_c13_u215	No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
s05_e03_c13_u216	We have our babies?
s05_e03_c13_u217	Yeah.
s05_e03_c13_u218	(Starting to cry) Oh, we have our babies.
s05_e03_c14_u219	Oh my God.
s05_e03_c14_u220	You did it, man.
s05_e03_c14_u221	Would you like to see them? (He hands Joey a little jar.)
s05_e03_c14_u222	They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on their faces.)
s05_e03_c15_u223	So, I'll call you tomorrow.
s05_e03_c15_u224	Great!
s05_e03_c15_u225	So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
s05_e03_c15_u226	Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
s05_e03_c15_u227	Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary- Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
s05_e03_c15_u228	I think you're better than you think you are.
s05_e03_c15_u229	Really? Okay, so
s05_e03_c15_u230	(interrupting) Know when to stop.
s05_e03_c15_u231	Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
s05_e03_c15_u232	Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.
s05_e03_c15_u233	Right!
s05_e03_c16_u234	I think you're my favorite.
s05_e03_c16_u235	Which one do you have?
s05_e03_c16_u236	I don't care.
s05_e03_c16_u237	(entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
s05_e03_c16_u238	But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know
s05_e03_c16_u239	Yeah, umm, no honey.
s05_e03_c16_u240	Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
s05_e03_c16_u241	Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
s05_e03_c16_u242	So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.) Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)
s05_e03_c17_u243	Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
s05_e03_c17_u244	I know.
s05_e03_c17_u245	So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
s05_e03_c17_u246	Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
s05_e03_c17_u247	So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
s05_e03_c17_u248	They're gonna call her Chandler.
s05_e03_c17_u249	That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
s05_e03_c17_u250	Works on you.
s06_e06_c01_u001	(watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he's scratching his back with it.) Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
s06_e06_c01_u002	Right! And when is that due?
s06_e06_c01_u003	First of the month.
s06_e06_c01_u004	And that's every month?
s06_e06_c01_u005	No, just the months you actually want to live here.
s06_e06_c01_u006	Ahhh.
s06_e06_c01_u007	Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)
s06_e06_c01_u008	(looking at it) Oh my God!!
s06_e06_c01_u009	That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
s06_e06_c01_u010	No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity-anymore.
s06_e06_c01_u011	It's not charity, Joe
s06_e06_c01_u012	No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
s06_e06_c01_u013	Okay uh, here's the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)
s06_e06_c01_u014	This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
s06_e06_c01_u015	Uh, yeah.
s06_e06_c01_u016	So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
s06_e06_c02_u017	So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
s06_e06_c02_u018	No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
s06_e06_c02_u019	Well, how much do you think he needs?
s06_e06_c02_u020	I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
s06_e06_c02_u021	Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
s06_e06_c02_u022	Well that would help the pride thing.
s06_e06_c02_u023	(entering from her room) Hey!
s06_e06_c02_u024	Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
s06_e06_c02_u025	(thinks) Okay.
s06_e06_c02_u026	Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
s06_e06_c02_u027	Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
s06_e06_c02_u028	And also, my birthday.
s06_e06_c02_u029	It's not your birthday.
s06_e06_c02_u030	What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
s06_e06_c02_u031	Hey!
s06_e06_c02_u032	Hey!
s06_e06_c02_u033	Hey!
s06_e06_c02_u034	Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
s06_e06_c02_u035	Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
s06_e06_c02_u036	Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
s06_e06_c02_u037	I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
s06_e06_c02_u038	I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
s06_e06_c02_u039	(entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering
s06_e06_c02_u040	You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
s06_e06_c02_u041	Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
s06_e06_c02_u042	Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
s06_e06_c02_u043	Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
s06_e06_c02_u044	My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
s06_e06_c02_u045	Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
s06_e06_c02_u046	Yeah, yeah, I know.
s06_e06_c02_u047	Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
s06_e06_c02_u048	(entering) Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
s06_e06_c02_u049	Surprise!!
s06_e06_c02_u050	What?
s06_e06_c02_u051	No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
s06_e06_c02_u052	(grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
s06_e06_c02_u053	I have plans.
s06_e06_c02_u054	You're plans were with us.
s06_e06_c02_u055	That's right.
s06_e06_c02_u056	All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
s06_e06_c02_u057	Okay.
s06_e06_c02_u058	Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!
s06_e06_c02_u059	Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the door.)
s06_e06_c02_u060	(entering and interrupting the guy's escape attempt) Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with
s06_e06_c02_u061	Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
s06_e06_c02_u062	I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
s06_e06_c02_u063	Yes, but for the last time.
s06_e06_c02_u064	Okay fine, now Ross
s06_e06_c02_u065	Oh, but-but I can't do it.
s06_e06_c02_u066	Why not?
s06_e06_c02_u067	(quietly) I've got Ben.
s06_e06_c02_u068	Because, because I've got Ben.
s06_e06_c02_u069	It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
s06_e06_c02_u070	He's at a dinner party.
s06_e06_c02_u071	Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
s06_e06_c02_u072	Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
s06_e06_c02_u073	All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachel's room.)
s06_e06_c02_u074	(to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.
s06_e06_c03_u075	Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
s06_e06_c03_u076	Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
s06_e06_c03_u077	Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
s06_e06_c03_u078	Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
s06_e06_c03_u079	What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
s06_e06_c03_u080	Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
s06_e06_c03_u081	Okay, you're on.
s06_e06_c03_u082	Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
s06_e06_c04_u083	Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
s06_e06_c04_u084	(starting to cry) Oh God!
s06_e06_c04_u085	You remember when we got these?
s06_e06_c04_u086	No.
s06_e06_c04_u087	I guess you weren't there. (They hug.)
s06_e06_c04_u088	You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time- (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don't remember?
s06_e06_c04_u089	I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
s06_e06_c04_u090	I'm gonna miss you so much.
s06_e06_c04_u091	Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
s06_e06_c04_u092	I don't think there's anything.
s06_e06_c04_u093	Come on, there's gotta be something.
s06_e06_c04_u094	Nope, she's perfect.
s06_e06_c04_u095	I have one.
s06_e06_c04_u096	Good! Great! You can go first.
s06_e06_c04_u097	Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
s06_e06_c04_u098	Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
s06_e06_c04_u099	Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
s06_e06_c04_u100	Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
s06_e06_c04_u101	Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
s06_e06_c04_u102	You get your messages!
s06_e06_c04_u103	Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
s06_e06_c04_u104	So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
s06_e06_c04_u105	Great! It worked! No one's sad.
s06_e06_c05_u106	(scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there's nothing in the fridge.) Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.
s06_e06_c05_u107	Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
s06_e06_c05_u108	You serious?
s06_e06_c05_u109	Oh yes!
s06_e06_c05_u110	Okay, get ready to owe me!
s06_e06_c05_u111	Okay.
s06_e06_c05_u112	Okay, here we go. Ready?
s06_e06_c05_u113	No! No! No! No-(Joey looks at him)-one can beat me.
s06_e06_c05_u114	See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
s06_e06_c06_u115	Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!
s06_e06_c06_u116	Ooh, your brother. Score!
s06_e06_c06_u117	(on phone) What's up?
s06_e06_c06_u118	Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
s06_e06_c06_u119	Oh, put him on!
s06_e06_c06_u120	Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
s06_e06_c07_u121	Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
s06_e06_c07_u122	You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
s06_e06_c07_u123	"Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
s06_e06_c07_u124	"I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
s06_e06_c07_u125	Hey! I call her!
s06_e06_c07_u126	"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
s06_e06_c07_u127	"Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
s06_e06_c07_u128	Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)
s06_e06_c08_u129	Still broken?
s06_e06_c08_u130	This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
s06_e06_c08_u131	Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)
s06_e06_c08_u132	Nah, not my game.
s06_e06_c08_u133	Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
s06_e06_c08_u134	Well, what's it called?
s06_e06_c08_u135	Cups.
s06_e06_c08_u136	I don't know how to play Cups.
s06_e06_c08_u137	I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
s06_e06_c08_u138	All right.
s06_e06_c08_u139	Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens, what do you have?
s06_e06_c08_u140	A two and a five.
s06_e06_c08_u141	Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
s06_e06_c08_u142	Really?!
s06_e06_c08_u143	Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?
s06_e06_c08_u144	A four and a nine.
s06_e06_c08_u145	You're kidding right?
s06_e06_c08_u146	No. Why?
s06_e06_c08_u147	Well that's a full cup! (Pays him again.)
s06_e06_c08_u148	Damn! I am good at Cups!
s06_e06_c09_u149	I'm not talking to her!
s06_e06_c09_u150	Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
s06_e06_c09_u151	Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
s06_e06_c09_u152	I know, I took it hard too.
s06_e06_c09_u153	Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing? (She sees that Rachel is unpacking.)
s06_e06_c09_u154	I'm unpacking!
s06_e06_c09_u155	What?!
s06_e06_c09_u156	I'm not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that picture straight?
s06_e06_c09_u157	It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
s06_e06_c09_u158	Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
s06_e06_c09_u159	Because it's my apartment!
s06_e06_c09_u160	Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
s06_e06_c09_u161	How about, you're moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants "Yes.")
s06_e06_c09_u162	Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)
s06_e06_c09_u163	Hey, how are you guys doing?
s06_e06_c09_u164	Great! Monica's moving!
s06_e06_c09_u165	(entering) I am not!
s06_e06_c09_u166	Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)
s06_e06_c09_u167	Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys- STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
s06_e06_c09_u168	No Phoebe I am mad!
s06_e06_c09_u169	Well, deep-deep-deep down!
s06_e06_c09_u170	Yeah, I'm just mad!
s06_e06_c09_u171	Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)
s06_e06_c10_u172	You win.
s06_e06_c10_u173	Well, what did you have?
s06_e06_c10_u174	It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
s06_e06_c10_u175	Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.
s06_e06_c10_u176	Not 700 exactly?
s06_e06_c10_u177	Yeah.
s06_e06_c10_u178	Double it! (He does.)
s06_e06_c10_u179	What?
s06_e06_c10_u180	Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
s06_e06_c10_u181	Really?
s06_e06_c10_u182	Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. Of course, any card would've won. Chandler pays him.)
s06_e06_c11_u183	Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
s06_e06_c11_u184	Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
s06_e06_c11_u185	Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
s06_e06_c11_u186	You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
s06_e06_c11_u187	Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
s06_e06_c11_u188	Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
s06_e06_c11_u189	Oh really? Like what Monica?
s06_e06_c11_u190	Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots
s06_e06_c11_u191	Oh yeah, good start Mon.
s06_e06_c11_u192	She lets you borrow them.
s06_e06_c11_u193	Yeah and you stretch em out with your big old clown feet.
s06_e06_c11_u194	Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! (To Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
s06_e06_c11_u195	What else?
s06_e06_c11_u196	When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
s06_e06_c11_u197	Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
s06_e06_c11_u198	That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
s06_e06_c11_u199	When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
s06_e06_c11_u200	Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
s06_e06_c11_u201	And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)
s06_e06_c11_u202	Oh, it's gonna be fine.
s06_e06_c11_u203	Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
s06_e06_c11_u204	But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
s06_e06_c11_u205	Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
s06_e06_c11_u206	Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it to get a better look.) Oh my God!
s06_e06_c11_u207	(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how's the packing going? (Listens) Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! (He looks over at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
s06_e06_c12_u208	Hey!
s06_e06_c12_u209	What's wrong?
s06_e06_c12_u210	Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
s06_e06_c12_u211	Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
s06_e06_c12_u212	The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
s06_e06_c12_u213	Oh man!!
s06_e06_c12_u214	And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
s06_e06_c12_u215	All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
s06_e06_c12_u216	No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
s06_e06_c12_u217	I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
s06_e06_c12_u218	It's him, not it!
s06_e06_c12_u219	No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?
s06_e06_c12_u220	Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
s06_e06_c12_u221	When did I try to give you money?
s06_e06_c12_u222	Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
s06_e06_c12_u223	I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
s06_e06_c12_u224	I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss-is you. And now the dog.
s06_e06_c13_u225	Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
s06_e06_c13_u226	Okay.
s06_e06_c13_u227	I'm really gonna miss you.
s06_e06_c13_u228	Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)
s06_e06_c13_u229	Thanks.
s06_e06_c13_u230	Yeah.
s06_e06_c13_u231	Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours! (They hug again.)
s06_e06_c13_u232	Yeah.
s06_e06_c13_u233	Bye house!
s06_e06_c13_u234	Bye Mon.
s06_e06_c13_u235	Bye.
s06_e06_c13_u236	(entering) Hey.
s06_e06_c13_u237	She really left.
s06_e06_c13_u238	I know. (He kisses her.)
s06_e06_c13_u239	Thank you.
s06_e06_c13_u240	No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
s06_e06_c13_u241	Can I ask you a question?
s06_e06_c13_u242	Sure!
s06_e06_c13_u243	What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
s06_e06_c14_u244	I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
s06_e06_c14_u245	And now you want that money back.
s06_e06_c14_u246	Exactly.
s06_e06_c14_u247	Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)
s06_e06_c14_u248	It's not a real game! I made it up!
s06_e06_c14_u249	I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
s06_e06_c14_u250	At a fake game!!
s06_e06_c14_u251	Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
s06_e06_c14_u252	Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
s06_e06_c14_u253	No.
s06_e06_c14_u254	Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)
s06_e14_c01_u001	(sees Rachel) Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh- Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
s06_e14_c01_u002	Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
s06_e14_c01_u003	Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
s06_e14_c01_u004	Joey we know you steal our food.
s06_e14_c01_u005	I'm good.
s06_e14_c01_u006	(To Rachel) Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
s06_e14_c01_u007	Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
s06_e14_c01_u008	(looking) Is that a swing?
s06_e14_c01_u009	Oh don't even ask!
s06_e14_c01_u010	Yuck!
s06_e14_c01_u011	I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
s06_e14_c01_u012	That was like 5 years ago.
s06_e14_c01_u013	Yeah you got 5 years left!
s06_e14_c01_u014	Joey
s06_e14_c01_u015	You wanna make it 6?!
s06_e14_c02_u016	Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
s06_e14_c02_u017	Hey!
s06_e14_c02_u018	(to Gunther) I'll take a coffee. (To Ross) So how was your big date last night?
s06_e14_c02_u019	Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
s06_e14_c02_u020	Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
s06_e14_c02_u021	I guess so.
s06_e14_c02_u022	So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
s06_e14_c02_u023	No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
s06_e14_c02_u024	Oh, slides. (Laughs.) So really nothing happened.
s06_e14_c02_u025	Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
s06_e14_c02_u026	Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
s06_e14_c02_u027	Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
s06_e14_c02_u028	She asked-asked you out again?
s06_e14_c02_u029	Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
s06_e14_c02_u030	Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
s06_e14_c02_u031	(while Rachel is finishing her rant) Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. (Rachel stops.) It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
s06_e14_c02_u032	Thank you. I-yeah.
s06_e14_c02_u033	I mean after tomorrow night.
s06_e14_c02_u034	No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! (Starts to freak out.) It's just gonna freak me out!!!
s06_e14_c02_u035	Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
s06_e14_c02_u036	Ross thanks.
s06_e14_c02_u037	You want me to call her right now?
s06_e14_c02_u038	Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
s06_e14_c02_u039	Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
s06_e14_c02_u040	Yeah do it now, call right now.
s06_e14_c03_u041	(crying) This is my favorite part.
s06_e14_c03_u042	(crying) Yeah me too.
s06_e14_c03_u043	Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
s06_e14_c03_u044	(totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
s06_e14_c03_u045	(crying) You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
s06_e14_c03_u046	Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
s06_e14_c03_u047	Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
s06_e14_c03_u048	I'm not macho.
s06_e14_c03_u049	Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
s06_e14_c03_u050	No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
s06_e14_c03_u051	Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
s06_e14_c03_u052	I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
s06_e14_c03_u053	Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
s06_e14_c03_u054	Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
s06_e14_c03_u055	Oh, I've got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from the dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
s06_e14_c03_u056	All right, what's going on there? (Points to a picture.)
s06_e14_c03_u057	Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
s06_e14_c03_u058	Where were your parents?
s06_e14_c03_u059	Oh they didn't want to come!
s06_e14_c03_u060	Oh Chandler!
s06_e14_c03_u061	Poor thing!
s06_e14_c03_u062	So that story doesn't make you cry?
s06_e14_c03_u063	No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
s06_e14_c03_u064	No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
s06_e14_c04_u065	Excuse me.
s06_e14_c04_u066	Yeah?
s06_e14_c04_u067	Are you Phoebe Buffay?
s06_e14_c04_u068	Yeah.
s06_e14_c04_u069	Can-can I get your autograph, I'm your biggest fan. (Holds out a napkin and a pen.)
s06_e14_c04_u070	Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! (Shakes his hand.) Sure! Yeah! (Signs the autograph)
s06_e14_c04_u071	Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
s06_e14_c04_u072	You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. (The fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? (Points) He's a fan. (To the fan as she's leaving) Bye! (Exits)
s06_e14_c04_u073	(to the fan) So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
s06_e14_c04_u074	I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!
s06_e14_c04_u075	Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
s06_e14_c04_u076	Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
s06_e14_c04_u077	Movies?
s06_e14_c04_u078	That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
s06_e14_c04_u079	(laughs) I don't think so.
s06_e14_c04_u080	No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this! (Exits.)
s06_e14_c04_u081	Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
s06_e14_c04_u082	Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
s06_e14_c05_u083	Hey!
s06_e14_c05_u084	Hey!
s06_e14_c05_u085	You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
s06_e14_c05_u086	Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
s06_e14_c05_u087	Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
s06_e14_c05_u088	It's not random, it's Bob.
s06_e14_c05_u089	It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
s06_e14_c05_u090	No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
s06_e14_c05_u091	You asked him too?!
s06_e14_c05_u092	Hm-mmm.
s06_e14_c05_u093	Why?!
s06_e14_c05_u094	Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history
s06_e14_c05_u095	I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
s06_e14_c05_u096	No.
s06_e14_c05_u097	You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
s06_e14_c05_u098	(changing the subject) Y'know Bob in Human Resources
s06_e14_c05_u099	Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! (Gasps) You had me doubting my fashion sense!
s06_e14_c05_u100	Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just
s06_e14_c05_u101	Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
s06_e14_c05_u102	I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
s06_e14_c05_u103	Why are you so jealous of me?
s06_e14_c05_u104	Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
s06_e14_c05_u105	Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy! (Starts to storm out.)
s06_e14_c05_u106	All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
s06_e14_c05_u107	Who?!
s06_e14_c05_u108	In Human Resources!!!!!!
s06_e14_c06_u109	I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
s06_e14_c06_u110	You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
s06_e14_c06_u111	Do I have my own castle?
s06_e14_c06_u112	Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
s06_e14_c06_u113	No.
s06_e14_c06_u114	(noticing the bag Joey's carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?
s06_e14_c06_u115	Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
s06_e14_c06_u116	You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
s06_e14_c06_u117	Sort of
s06_e14_c06_u118	Guys, what's going on?
s06_e14_c06_u119	(holds up the movie) Phoebe's a porn star!
s06_e14_c06_u120	What?!!
s06_e14_c06_u121	Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
s06_e14_c06_u122	Oh my God!
s06_e14_c06_u123	That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
s06_e14_c06_u124	Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
s06_e14_c06_u125	And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there. (They all kinda look at him.)
s06_e14_c06_u126	Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
s06_e14_c06_u127	This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
s06_e14_c06_u128	Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
s06_e14_c06_u129	Yes, but you are dead inside.
s06_e14_c06_u130	All right well, I'd better take that back.
s06_e14_c06_u131	Wh-what, why?
s06_e14_c06_u132	We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
s06_e14_c06_u133	Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
s06_e14_c06_u134	Absolutely not.
s06_e14_c06_u135	(hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn't let him grab it) Y'know maybe a little bit!
s06_e14_c06_u136	Probably just the first half.
s06_e14_c06_u137	No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
s06_e14_c06_u138	Yeah! Good for you Joe!
s06_e14_c06_u139	Yeah.
s06_e14_c06_u140	Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
s06_e14_c06_u141	Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
s06_e14_c06_u142	Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
s06_e14_c06_u143	Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
s06_e14_c06_u144	Her ankle is what you're watching?
s06_e14_c06_u145	Well it's hard to tell- (Rachel gets up to get a closer look, only she's having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
s06_e14_c06_u146	She's just doing her job!
s06_e14_c06_u147	(sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!
s06_e14_c06_u148	Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't- Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
s06_e14_c06_u149	Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
s06_e14_c06_u150	(entering) Hey! What's up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
s06_e14_c07_u151	Hey sweetie!
s06_e14_c07_u152	Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
s06_e14_c07_u153	(picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul?
s06_e14_c07_u154	There's no back to this couch!
s06_e14_c07_u155	Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
s06_e14_c07_u156	Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
s06_e14_c07_u157	Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
s06_e14_c07_u158	Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
s06_e14_c07_u159	Stop it!
s06_e14_c07_u160	No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this. (Makes a bored face.)
s06_e14_c07_u161	I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. (Points to her heart.)
s06_e14_c07_u162	Yeah?
s06_e14_c07_u163	Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
s06_e14_c07_u164	Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
s06_e14_c07_u165	And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
s06_e14_c07_u166	Aww, I love you so
s06_e14_c07_u167	What is wrong with you?!!!
s06_e14_c07_u168	What?!
s06_e14_c07_u169	What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
s06_e14_c07_u170	So you didn't mean any of that?!
s06_e14_c07_u171	No you robot!!
s06_e14_c08_u172	You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to- (Opens the door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. (Quickly looks out to see if they're watching.) Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
s06_e14_c08_u173	Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
s06_e14_c08_u174	Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)
s06_e14_c08_u175	(entering) I don't want to talk about it.
s06_e14_c08_u176	Okay, umm
s06_e14_c08_u177	But you know what might really cheer me up?
s06_e14_c08_u178	What?
s06_e14_c08_u179	Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
s06_e14_c08_u180	Wow! Really?!
s06_e14_c08_u181	Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
s06_e14_c08_u182	Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
s06_e14_c08_u183	Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
s06_e14_c08_u184	Ohh!
s06_e14_c08_u185	Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
s06_e14_c08_u186	No, I haven't.
s06_e14_c08_u187	Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
s06_e14_c09_u188	Who is it?
s06_e14_c09_u189	It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
s06_e14_c09_u190	Hey!
s06_e14_c09_u191	(seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
s06_e14_c09_u192	No I'm not.
s06_e14_c09_u193	You're making one right now!
s06_e14_c09_u194	And-and you're using my name!
s06_e14_c09_u195	Yeah, can I help you with something?
s06_e14_c09_u196	Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her.
s06_e14_c09_u197	Y'know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
s06_e14_c09_u198	What?!
s06_e14_c09_u199	Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
s06_e14_c09_u200	No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into the apartment) And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you (points to someone) with that! (Storms away.)
s06_e14_c10_u201	Slides are almost ready.
s06_e14_c10_u202	Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
s06_e14_c10_u203	Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
s06_e14_c10_u204	Oh great! (Goes to get it as the phone rings.)
s06_e14_c10_u205	(answering it) Hello?
s06_e14_c10_u206	(on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
s06_e14_c10_u207	O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
s06_e14_c10_u208	Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
s06_e14_c10_u209	So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
s06_e14_c10_u210	Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
s06_e14_c10_u211	Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.) Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
s06_e14_c10_u212	So? (Kisses him passionately.)
s06_e14_c11_u213	Hey!
s06_e14_c11_u214	Hey!
s06_e14_c11_u215	So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
s06_e14_c11_u216	Oh no, not you too!
s06_e14_c11_u217	No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
s06_e14_c11_u218	Nice!
s06_e14_c11_u219	Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
s06_e14_c11_u220	That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
s06_e14_c11_u221	Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
s06_e14_c11_u222	You do?
s06_e14_c11_u223	Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where he's seen her before.) (To him) You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To Joey) See?
s06_e14_c11_u224	Yeah.
s06_e14_c12_u225	Hey.
s06_e14_c12_u226	(To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
s06_e14_c12_u227	Oh! I knew it! What happened?
s06_e14_c12_u228	Umm, she kissed me.
s06_e14_c12_u229	What?! You kissed!
s06_e14_c12_u230	(To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.
s06_e14_c12_u231	(To Chandler) Shhhh!!!
s06_e14_c12_u232	Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
s06_e14_c12_u233	Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
s06_e14_c12_u234	Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking
s06_e14_c12_u235	Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)
s06_e14_c12_u236	Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
s06_e14_c12_u237	Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
s06_e14_c12_u238	Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
s06_e14_c12_u239	What?!
s06_e14_c12_u240	No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
s06_e14_c12_u241	Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks him.)
s06_e14_c12_u242	You're welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)
s06_e14_c12_u243	Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
s06_e14_c12_u244	(crying hysterically) I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
s06_e14_c13_u245	All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
s06_e14_c13_u246	Yeah, I got that.
s06_e14_c13_u247	(To Ross) And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
s06_e14_c13_u248	You take care Jill.
s06_e14_c13_u249	(happily) Okay, see ya! (Exits.)
s06_e14_c13_u250	Bye-bye-e!
s06_e14_c13_u251	Bye.
s06_e14_c13_u252	(starts crying) I-I can't believe Jill's gone. (They all look at him.) I can't help it, I opened a gate.
s01_e08_c01_u001	Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
s01_e08_c01_u002	Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
s01_e08_c01_u003	Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
s01_e08_c01_u004	Do you want a date Saturday?
s01_e08_c01_u005	Yes please.
s01_e08_c01_u006	Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
s01_e08_c01_u007	He's a he?
s01_e08_c01_u008	Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye...
s01_e08_c02_u009	...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
s01_e08_c02_u010	Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
s01_e08_c02_u011	You did?
s01_e08_c02_u012	Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
s01_e08_c02_u013	Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
s01_e08_c02_u014	I did.
s01_e08_c02_u015	Yeah, I think so, yeah.
s01_e08_c02_u016	Not me.
s01_e08_c02_u017	Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
s01_e08_c02_u018	You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
s01_e08_c02_u019	No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
s01_e08_c02_u020	Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
s01_e08_c02_u021	I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
s01_e08_c02_u022	Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
s01_e08_c02_u023	Yeah! Right!
s01_e08_c02_u024	WHAT IS IT?!
s01_e08_c02_u025	Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
s01_e08_c02_u026	Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
s01_e08_c02_u027	Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
s01_e08_c02_u028	Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
s01_e08_c02_u029	Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.
s01_e08_c02_u030	(to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
s01_e08_c02_u031	Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.
s01_e08_c02_u032	Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
s01_e08_c03_u033	So, uh, how's she doing?
s01_e08_c03_u034	The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
s01_e08_c03_u035	How-how are you, Mom?
s01_e08_c03_u036	Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
s01_e08_c03_u037	What?
s01_e08_c03_u038	What's different?
s01_e08_c03_u039	Nothing.
s01_e08_c03_u040	Oh, maybe that's it.
s01_e08_c03_u041	She is unbelievable, our mother is...
s01_e08_c03_u042	Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
s01_e08_c03_u043	Oh God!
s01_e08_c03_u044	The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
s01_e08_c03_u045	Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
s01_e08_c03_u046	Not just restaurants, from our house.
s01_e08_c03_u047	Mrs. Geller?
s01_e08_c03_u048	She looks so small.
s01_e08_c03_u049	I know.
s01_e08_c03_u050	Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
s01_e08_c03_u051	G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)
s01_e08_c03_u052	Bye, Nana.
s01_e08_c03_u053	Ross!
s01_e08_c03_u054	What is going on?!
s01_e08_c03_u055	Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
s01_e08_c03_u056	What?
s01_e08_c03_u057	She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
s01_e08_c03_u058	(reentering) What's going on?
s01_e08_c03_u059	She may have died.
s01_e08_c03_u060	She may have died?
s01_e08_c03_u061	We're looking into it.
s01_e08_c03_u062	I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)
s01_e08_c03_u063	This almost never happens!
s01_e08_c03_u064	Now she's passed.
s01_e08_c04_u065	I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
s01_e08_c04_u066	(exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
s01_e08_c04_u067	Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
s01_e08_c04_u068	So, um, did she...
s01_e08_c04_u069	Twice.
s01_e08_c04_u070	Twice?
s01_e08_c04_u071	Oh, that sucks!
s01_e08_c04_u072	You guys okay?
s01_e08_c04_u073	I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
s01_e08_c04_u074	Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
s01_e08_c04_u075	Nono, she's gone.
s01_e08_c04_u076	We checked. A lot.
s01_e08_c04_u077	Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
s01_e08_c04_u078	Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)
s01_e08_c04_u079	Thanks!
s01_e08_c04_u080	Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
s01_e08_c04_u081	Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
s01_e08_c04_u082	Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the pencil)
s01_e08_c05_u083	I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
s01_e08_c05_u084	Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
s01_e08_c05_u085	Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
s01_e08_c05_u086	(sarcastic) I don't see why not.
s01_e08_c05_u087	Here's my retainer!
s01_e08_c06_u088	I was just thinking. When my time comes-
s01_e08_c06_u089	Dad!
s01_e08_c06_u090	Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
s01_e08_c06_u091	You what?
s01_e08_c06_u092	I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
s01_e08_c06_u093	Define fun.
s01_e08_c06_u094	C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
s01_e08_c06_u095	...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
s01_e08_c06_u096	Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
s01_e08_c06_u097	That's probably what they'll say.
s01_e08_c06_u098	I'd like that.
s01_e08_c07_u099	Hey, gorgeous.
s01_e08_c07_u100	No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
s01_e08_c07_u101	Oh! Okay! Phew!
s01_e08_c07_u102	So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
s01_e08_c07_u103	I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
s01_e08_c07_u104	...Quality, right, great.
s01_e08_c07_u105	Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
s01_e08_c07_u106	Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
s01_e08_c07_u107	What? He's cute!
s01_e08_c07_u108	Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
s01_e08_c07_u109	Is Brian...?
s01_e08_c07_u110	No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
s01_e08_c07_u111	Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
s01_e08_c07_u112	Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
s01_e08_c08_u113	(holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
s01_e08_c08_u114	No.
s01_e08_c08_u115	I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
s01_e08_c08_u116	You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
s01_e08_c08_u117	You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
s01_e08_c08_u118	Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
s01_e08_c08_u119	Wait! We need shoes!
s01_e08_c08_u120	Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)
s01_e08_c08_u121	That's really a day shoe.
s01_e08_c08_u122	And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
s01_e08_c08_u123	Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
s01_e08_c08_u124	(forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
s01_e08_c08_u125	No, it really should be burgundy.
s01_e08_c08_u126	Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
s01_e08_c08_u127	No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
s01_e08_c08_u128	Oh my God..
s01_e08_c08_u129	Is everything all right, dear?
s01_e08_c08_u130	Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
s01_e08_c09_u131	(entering) How we doing, you guys ready?
s01_e08_c09_u132	Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
s01_e08_c09_u133	Some days it's all I can think about.
s01_e08_c09_u134	(entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
s01_e08_c09_u135	Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
s01_e08_c09_u136	What'd I say?
s01_e08_c09_u137	(sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
s01_e08_c09_u138	Are these the shoes?
s01_e08_c09_u139	Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
s01_e08_c09_u140	What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
s01_e08_c09_u141	(entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
s01_e08_c09_u142	Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
s01_e08_c10_u143	It was a really beautiful service.
s01_e08_c10_u144	It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
s01_e08_c10_u145	What?
s01_e08_c10_u146	Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
s01_e08_c10_u147	Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)
s01_e08_c10_u148	You're watching a football game at a funeral?
s01_e08_c10_u149	No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
s01_e08_c10_u150	You are a frightening, frightening man.
s01_e08_c10_u151	Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
s01_e08_c10_u152	Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
s01_e08_c10_u153	God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
s01_e08_c10_u154	I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave)
s01_e08_c10_u155	God! Ross!
s01_e08_c10_u156	I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
s01_e08_c11_u157	Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
s01_e08_c11_u158	What, what is it?
s01_e08_c11_u159	You missed a belt loop.
s01_e08_c11_u160	Oh! No-n-
s01_e08_c11_u161	Okay, it's in spasm.
s01_e08_c11_u162	Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. (Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)
s01_e08_c11_u163	Oh, no-
s01_e08_c11_u164	Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
s01_e08_c11_u165	Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
s01_e08_c11_u166	Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
s01_e08_c11_u167	I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
s01_e08_c11_u168	Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
s01_e08_c11_u169	Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)
s01_e08_c11_u170	Ooh! That's so nice...
s01_e08_c11_u171	...Chandler!
s01_e08_c11_u172	Hey.
s01_e08_c11_u173	(hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
s01_e08_c11_u174	(turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)
s01_e08_c11_u175	Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
s01_e08_c11_u176	No.
s01_e08_c11_u177	You!
s01_e08_c11_u178	Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
s01_e08_c11_u179	Whaddya got there?
s01_e08_c11_u180	(hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing disability.
s01_e08_c11_u181	What's the score?
s01_e08_c11_u182	Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
s01_e08_c11_u183	Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)
s01_e08_c11_u184	(still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
s01_e08_c11_u185	Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
s01_e08_c11_u186	No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
s01_e08_c11_u187	That sounds like Nana.
s01_e08_c11_u188	Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
s01_e08_c11_u189	...I can imagine.
s01_e08_c11_u190	I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
s01_e08_c11_u191	That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
s01_e08_c11_u192	Tell her what?
s01_e08_c11_u193	How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
s01_e08_c11_u194	I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
s01_e08_c11_u195	Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
s01_e08_c11_u196	...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
s01_e08_c11_u197	Huh.
s01_e08_c11_u198	More wine, dear?
s01_e08_c11_u199	Oh, I think so.
s01_e08_c11_u200	(reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises) Those earrings look really lovely on you.
s01_e08_c11_u201	Thank you. They're yours.
s01_e08_c11_u202	Actually they were Nana's.
s01_e08_c11_u203	Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was.
s01_e08_c12_u204	Hey, who's this little naked guy?
s01_e08_c12_u205	That little naked guy would be me.
s01_e08_c12_u206	Aww, look at the little thing.
s01_e08_c12_u207	Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
s01_e08_c12_u208	Who are those people?
s01_e08_c12_u209	Got me.
s01_e08_c12_u210	Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
s01_e08_c12_u211	Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
s01_e08_c12_u212	Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
s01_e08_c12_u213	Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
s01_e08_c12_u214	Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
s01_e08_c12_u215	(looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
s01_e08_c13_u216	Hey, Lowell.
s01_e08_c13_u217	So how's it going there in Financial Services?
s01_e08_c13_u218	Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
s01_e08_c13_u219	I know. That's what I told her.
s01_e08_c13_u220	Really.
s01_e08_c13_u221	Yeah.
s01_e08_c13_u222	So- you can tell?
s01_e08_c13_u223	Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
s01_e08_c13_u224	So you don't think I have a, a quality?
s01_e08_c13_u225	Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
s01_e08_c13_u226	He is?
s01_e08_c13_u227	Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)
s01_e08_c13_u228	Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.
s05_e04_c01_u001	(In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you.
s05_e04_c01_u002	Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in horror.) Oh my God!
s05_e04_c01_u003	(pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
s05_e04_c01_u004	Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
s05_e04_c01_u005	Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
s05_e04_c01_u006	(Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
s05_e04_c01_u007	Uh-huh, that one!
s05_e04_c01_u008	Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock on the door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)
s05_e04_c01_u009	(Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm- (Rachel opens the door.) It's just Joey and Ross.
s05_e04_c01_u010	Why aren't you guys at the movie?
s05_e04_c01_u011	Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
s05_e04_c01_u012	I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
s05_e04_c01_u013	(to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!
s05_e04_c01_u014	But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
s05_e04_c01_u015	Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
s05_e04_c01_u016	(on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
s05_e04_c01_u017	Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
s05_e04_c01_u018	(entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
s05_e04_c02_u019	(entering, wearing a tux) Hey!
s05_e04_c02_u020	Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
s05_e04_c02_u021	Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
s05_e04_c02_u022	Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
s05_e04_c02_u023	Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
s05_e04_c02_u024	Oh that's great!
s05_e04_c02_u025	A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
s05_e04_c02_u026	Ugh, PBS!
s05_e04_c02_u027	What's wrong with PBS?
s05_e04_c02_u028	Ugh, what's right with them?
s05_e04_c02_u029	Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
s05_e04_c02_u030	Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
s05_e04_c02_u031	Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
s05_e04_c02_u032	All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
s05_e04_c02_u033	I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
s05_e04_c02_u034	This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
s05_e04_c02_u035	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
s05_e04_c02_u036	What-what are you talking about?!
s05_e04_c02_u037	Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
s05_e04_c02_u038	Yeah. So?
s05_e04_c02_u039	It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
s05_e04_c02_u040	Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
s05_e04_c02_u041	Well, may I ask for one example?
s05_e04_c02_u042	Yeah, it's- Y'know there's-no you may not!
s05_e04_c02_u043	That's because all people are selfish.
s05_e04_c02_u044	Are you calling me selfish?!
s05_e04_c02_u045	Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
s05_e04_c02_u046	I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
s05_e04_c02_u047	(on phone) Hello.
s05_e04_c02_u048	(on phone from London) Hello, Ross?
s05_e04_c02_u049	Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and hands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily) Hi!
s05_e04_c02_u050	Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
s05_e04_c02_u051	No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
s05_e04_c02_u052	Really? About what?
s05_e04_c02_u053	Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
s05_e04_c02_u054	I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
s05_e04_c02_u055	(to the gang, whispering) She's talking.
s05_e04_c02_u056	(subdued) Yay! (He motions for them to keep quiet, including Chandler who is still holding the lamp Ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to Emily in private.)
s05_e04_c02_u057	Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
s05_e04_c02_u058	That he doesn't exist.
s05_e04_c02_u059	Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)
s05_e04_c03_u060	So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
s05_e04_c03_u061	Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
s05_e04_c03_u062	So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
s05_e04_c03_u063	Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
s05_e04_c03_u064	Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
s05_e04_c03_u065	I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
s05_e04_c03_u066	Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?
s05_e04_c03_u067	I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?
s05_e04_c03_u068	Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky dog!
s05_e04_c03_u069	(entering) Hi!
s05_e04_c03_u070	Hey!
s05_e04_c03_u071	Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
s05_e04_c03_u072	Yes!
s05_e04_c03_u073	That's great!
s05_e04_c03_u074	In London!
s05_e04_c03_u075	What?!
s05_e04_c03_u076	She wants me to move to London.
s05_e04_c03_u077	But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.
s05_e04_c03_u078	What-what-what are you gonna do?
s05_e04_c03_u079	I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
s05_e04_c03_u080	Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
s05_e04_c03_u081	It could happen.
s05_e04_c04_u082	(To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
s05_e04_c04_u083	This will be your phone.
s05_e04_c04_u084	That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
s05_e04_c04_u085	No you answer it and take pledges.
s05_e04_c04_u086	But I'm the host!
s05_e04_c04_u087	No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
s05_e04_c04_u088	You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
s05_e04_c04_u089	Well, here's your phone doctor. (She walks away.)
s05_e04_c05_u090	I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
s05_e04_c05_u091	Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
s05_e04_c05_u092	I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
s05_e04_c05_u093	(entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
s05_e04_c05_u094	Sure!
s05_e04_c05_u095	If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
s05_e04_c05_u096	Chandler! (Pause) Is he?
s05_e04_c05_u097	Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
s05_e04_c05_u098	Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)
s05_e04_c06_u099	All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
s05_e04_c06_u100	I understand that would be difficult.
s05_e04_c06_u101	Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
s05_e04_c06_u102	I don't know, it's just
s05_e04_c06_u103	Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
s05_e04_c06_u104	All right.
s05_e04_c06_u105	All right, did you just say all right?
s05_e04_c06_u106	I did. Now I'm the idiot.
s05_e04_c06_u107	Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
s05_e04_c06_u108	Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
s05_e04_c06_u109	Yes, tell me.
s05_e04_c06_u110	Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
s05_e04_c06_u111	I know. I am, I am so sorry.
s05_e04_c06_u112	And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
s05_e04_c06_u113	Again, very sorry.
s05_e04_c06_u114	I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
s05_e04_c06_u115	Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
s05_e04_c06_u116	All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
s05_e04_c06_u117	Oh that is so great! That's
s05_e04_c06_u118	(interrupting him) As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
s05_e04_c07_u119	So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
s05_e04_c07_u120	Yes!
s05_e04_c07_u121	Ooh-ohh!
s05_e04_c07_u122	Great!
s05_e04_c07_u123	No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
s05_e04_c07_u124	Why?
s05_e04_c07_u125	What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
s05_e04_c07_u126	I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!
s05_e04_c07_u127	Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
s05_e04_c07_u128	Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
s05_e04_c07_u129	Yeah.
s05_e04_c07_u130	That's true!
s05_e04_c07_u131	Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
s05_e04_c07_u132	That's true!
s05_e04_c07_u133	No, you cannot.
s05_e04_c07_u134	Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)
s05_e04_c07_u135	(answering it) Hello.
s05_e04_c07_u136	(on phone) Hey Mon!
s05_e04_c07_u137	Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
s05_e04_c07_u138	See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
s05_e04_c07_u139	(Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.
s05_e04_c07_u140	Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)
s05_e04_c07_u141	Hey, there he is! There he is!
s05_e04_c07_u142	Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)
s05_e04_c08_u143	(on TV.) Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs
s05_e04_c08_u144	How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
s05_e04_c08_u145	(entering) Hi Chandler.
s05_e04_c08_u146	Hey!
s05_e04_c08_u147	Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
s05_e04_c08_u148	Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
s05_e04_c08_u149	William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
s05_e04_c08_u150	Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
s05_e04_c08_u151	Yeah, so?
s05_e04_c08_u152	Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
s05_e04_c08_u153	Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
s05_e04_c08_u154	Why?
s05_e04_c08_u155	Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy dance.)
s05_e04_c08_u156	What's your point?
s05_e04_c09_u157	(in a bored voice) PBS telethon.
s05_e04_c09_u158	(on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
s05_e04_c09_u159	What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
s05_e04_c09_u160	Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
s05_e04_c09_u161	Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
s05_e04_c09_u162	(Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)
s05_e04_c09_u163	Back on in 30 seconds people!
s05_e04_c09_u164	Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
s05_e04_c09_u165	Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
s05_e04_c09_u166	Come on man! You've been here all day!
s05_e04_c09_u167	Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
s05_e04_c09_u168	We're on in 3, 2, (points to Gary Collins.)
s05_e04_c09_u169	Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, (As he is speaking, Joey and the volunteer getting into a shoving match.) and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do (Joey is knocked down.) is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to- (Just as the volunteer sits down, Joey pulls him to the ground.)
s05_e04_c10_u170	(entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and starts shaking a-)
s05_e04_c10_u171	A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
s05_e04_c10_u172	Ooh, it's not a toy.
s05_e04_c10_u173	Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
s05_e04_c10_u174	All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
s05_e04_c11_u175	(in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.
s05_e04_c11_u176	(on phone) Hi Joey.
s05_e04_c11_u177	Hey Pheebs!
s05_e04_c11_u178	I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
s05_e04_c11_u179	$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
s05_e04_c11_u180	Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
s05_e04_c11_u181	And you don't a little good about donating the money?
s05_e04_c11_u182	No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
s05_e04_c11_u183	A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
s05_e04_c11_u184	Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
s05_e04_c11_u185	(on TV.) It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers-(He walks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, (Joey stands up.) Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
s05_e04_c11_u186	Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
s05_e04_c12_u187	(entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
s05_e04_c12_u188	Keep talking.
s05_e04_c12_u189	I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH-MY-GOD.
s05_e04_c12_u190	Really?
s05_e04_c12_u191	Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
s05_e04_c12_u192	Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) Oh my- When is Joey gonna be home?
s05_e04_c12_u193	Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
s05_e04_c12_u194	But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
s05_e04_c12_u195	Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
s05_e04_c12_u196	Yeah. (She takes them off.)
s05_e04_c12_u197	All right, let's show them how it's done.
s05_e04_c12_u198	Okay.
s05_e04_c12_u199	Ow!
s05_e04_c12_u200	Y'know that wasn't part of it?
s05_e04_c12_u201	I know!
s05_e04_c13_u202	(entering) Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
s05_e04_c13_u203	For what?
s05_e04_c13_u204	For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
s05_e04_c13_u205	Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
s05_e04_c13_u206	Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
s05_e04_c13_u207	It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
s05_e04_c13_u208	Like what?
s05_e04_c13_u209	Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
s05_e04_c13_u210	Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
s05_e04_c13_u211	No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
s05_e04_c13_u212	Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to- Hi!
s05_e04_c13_u213	Thanks.
s05_e04_c13_u214	Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
s05_e04_c13_u215	(answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. (Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not knowing what's going on.)
s05_e04_c14_u216	Never done that before.
s05_e04_c14_u217	Nope.
s03_e18_c01_u001	(to Joey) What's so funny?
s03_e18_c01_u002	Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
s03_e18_c01_u003	Oh. (she laughs)
s03_e18_c01_u004	What-what's so funny?
s03_e18_c01_u005	(to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
s03_e18_c01_u006	Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
s03_e18_c01_u007	Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
s03_e18_c01_u008	Okay.
s03_e18_c01_u009	Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler back the cigarette.)
s03_e18_c01_u010	No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
s03_e18_c01_u011	Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
s03_e18_c01_u012	Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
s03_e18_c01_u013	Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)
s03_e18_c01_u014	Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
s03_e18_c01_u015	Pffhah.
s03_e18_c01_u016	(to Ross) What's your problem?
s03_e18_c01_u017	Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
s03_e18_c01_u018	Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
s03_e18_c01_u019	Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
s03_e18_c01_u020	Oh right, cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
s03_e18_c01_u021	All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
s03_e18_c01_u022	Or what my Father called Thursday night.
s03_e18_c02_u023	Here you go.
s03_e18_c02_u024	Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
s03_e18_c02_u025	Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)
s03_e18_c02_u026	(entering) Hi!
s03_e18_c02_u027	Oh my God!!
s03_e18_c02_u028	Hi!
s03_e18_c02_u029	Frank! Hi!
s03_e18_c02_u030	How are you?
s03_e18_c02_u031	What are you doing here?
s03_e18_c02_u032	Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
s03_e18_c02_u033	What happened?
s03_e18_c02_u034	Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
s03_e18_c02_u035	But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
s03_e18_c02_u036	Well, we got into a fight cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
s03_e18_c02_u037	Your getting married?!
s03_e18_c02_u038	Oh, yeah!
s03_e18_c02_u039	Wow!
s03_e18_c02_u040	My little brother's getting married!!
s03_e18_c02_u041	Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
s03_e18_c02_u042	Do I?
s03_e18_c02_u043	Do you?
s03_e18_c02_u044	Yeah, I do, yeah.
s03_e18_c02_u045	Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. (to Joey) I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiancee man!
s03_e18_c02_u046	Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
s03_e18_c02_u047	Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
s03_e18_c02_u048	Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
s03_e18_c02_u049	What, he's 18.
s03_e18_c02_u050	Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
s03_e18_c02_u051	Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
s03_e18_c02_u052	Always illegal Joe.
s03_e18_c02_u053	(entering with his fiancee Alice, who is obviously much, much older than he is) Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancee, Mrs. Knight. (he points out Phoebe to her)
s03_e18_c02_u054	Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
s03_e18_c02_u055	Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
s03_e18_c02_u056	So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
s03_e18_c02_u057	Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
s03_e18_c02_u058	And he was my best student.
s03_e18_c02_u059	Yeah, she was my best teacher.
s03_e18_c02_u060	Ohhh. (They embrace in a very passionate kiss.)
s03_e18_c02_u061	If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
s03_e18_c02_u062	And so now you guys are gonna be married?
s03_e18_c02_u063	Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
s03_e18_c02_u064	Oh my God!! Great!
s03_e18_c02_u065	Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
s03_e18_c02_u066	I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
s03_e18_c02_u067	Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
s03_e18_c02_u068	Oh good! Okay. Cause you were acting like you didn't.
s03_e18_c02_u069	Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
s03_e18_c03_u070	You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
s03_e18_c04_u071	And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
s03_e18_c04_u072	Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
s03_e18_c04_u073	(to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?
s03_e18_c04_u074	Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' em out.
s03_e18_c04_u075	Haven't you and I covered that topic?
s03_e18_c04_u076	Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you-.
s03_e18_c04_u077	Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
s03_e18_c04_u078	Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
s03_e18_c04_u079	(laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
s03_e18_c04_u080	I mean really, think about it.
s03_e18_c04_u081	Ho-ho, I will.
s03_e18_c05_u082	No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
s03_e18_c05_u083	Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
s03_e18_c05_u084	No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
s03_e18_c05_u085	Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
s03_e18_c05_u086	But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
s03_e18_c05_u087	Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
s03_e18_c05_u088	Yes. Not out loud.
s03_e18_c05_u089	Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
s03_e18_c05_u090	Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
s03_e18_c05_u091	No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them, and turns them back to face her.)
s03_e18_c05_u092	Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
s03_e18_c05_u093	No.
s03_e18_c05_u094	Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank. (exits)
s03_e18_c05_u095	So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, let's just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
s03_e18_c06_u096	I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
s03_e18_c06_u097	Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
s03_e18_c06_u098	Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?
s03_e18_c06_u099	Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids-. (realises) All right, I get your point.
s03_e18_c06_u100	All right.
s03_e18_c06_u101	(entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.
s03_e18_c06_u102	Hey.
s03_e18_c06_u103	Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
s03_e18_c06_u104	Uh, yeah.
s03_e18_c06_u105	Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
s03_e18_c06_u106	Y'know what, pretty good.
s03_e18_c06_u107	Yeah?
s03_e18_c06_u108	Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
s03_e18_c06_u109	Thank you.
s03_e18_c06_u110	Here you go.
s03_e18_c06_u111	Thanks
s03_e18_c06_u112	Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
s03_e18_c06_u113	What check thing?
s03_e18_c06_u114	As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
s03_e18_c06_u115	(reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete- (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?
s03_e18_c06_u116	That's Bill Clinton.
s03_e18_c06_u117	Who's he huggin'?
s03_e18_c06_u118	Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
s03_e18_c06_u119	This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
s03_e18_c06_u120	We use it!!
s03_e18_c06_u121	There you go!!
s03_e18_c06_u122	Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
s03_e18_c06_u123	I'm not gonna go out with him.
s03_e18_c06_u124	Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
s03_e18_c06_u125	Or incredibly offensive.
s03_e18_c06_u126	Oh yeah, sure, that too.
s03_e18_c06_u127	(to the girls who are staring at him) What?
s03_e18_c07_u128	All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
s03_e18_c07_u129	Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
s03_e18_c07_u130	What, you don't think I know that?
s03_e18_c07_u131	Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
s03_e18_c07_u132	Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
s03_e18_c07_u133	Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
s03_e18_c07_u134	Yeah, in a poem maybe.
s03_e18_c07_u135	No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
s03_e18_c07_u136	You don't have it anymore?
s03_e18_c07_u137	No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
s03_e18_c07_u138	Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
s03_e18_c07_u139	It didn't.
s03_e18_c07_u140	Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
s03_e18_c07_u141	Now, wh-what, what is that like?
s03_e18_c07_u142	It's so cool man, it's so, it's just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
s03_e18_c07_u143	Yeah, yeah.
s03_e18_c07_u144	(to Ross) Why can't I find that?
s03_e18_c07_u145	Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
s03_e18_c07_u146	Well, I want it!
s03_e18_c07_u147	You can have it!
s03_e18_c07_u148	I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
s03_e18_c07_u149	Oh, no! No!
s03_e18_c07_u150	It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
s03_e18_c07_u151	Then you hold on to it!!
s03_e18_c07_u152	All right, man!!
s03_e18_c07_u153	All right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)
s03_e18_c08_u154	(to Joey) You're Frank's best man?!
s03_e18_c08_u155	I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
s03_e18_c08_u156	Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!
s03_e18_c08_u157	I'm the ring bearer.
s03_e18_c09_u158	Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)
s03_e18_c09_u159	Oh my God, who died on this?!
s03_e18_c09_u160	Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
s03_e18_c09_u161	Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to
s03_e18_c09_u162	Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
s03_e18_c09_u163	Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
s03_e18_c09_u164	Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
s03_e18_c10_u165	Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
s03_e18_c10_u166	Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
s03_e18_c10_u167	You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
s03_e18_c10_u168	Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. (Monica enters) Hi.
s03_e18_c10_u169	What the hell is this? (holding up the check)
s03_e18_c10_u170	Hang on a second. (to the employees) I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. (turns two of the three off) I'm sorry what?
s03_e18_c10_u171	Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
s03_e18_c10_u172	Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
s03_e18_c10_u173	You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
s03_e18_c10_u174	Umm, I'm still here.
s03_e18_c10_u175	(turns off the TV) You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
s03_e18_c10_u176	What?!
s03_e18_c10_u177	Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
s03_e18_c10_u178	Okay, umm, you're a loon.
s03_e18_c10_u179	Look, forget the check, okay. (rips up the check) I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
s03_e18_c10_u180	I don't know.
s03_e18_c10_u181	Why not?
s03_e18_c10_u182	Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
s03_e18_c10_u183	One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
s03_e18_c11_u184	(hiding under a pile of clothes) Hi. (She jumps up screaming.) Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
s03_e18_c11_u185	Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
s03_e18_c11_u186	Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
s03_e18_c11_u187	Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
s03_e18_c11_u188	Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
s03_e18_c11_u189	What umm, what happened?
s03_e18_c11_u190	Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
s03_e18_c11_u191	Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
s03_e18_c11_u192	Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
s03_e18_c11_u193	Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
s03_e18_c11_u194	Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
s03_e18_c11_u195	Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)
s03_e18_c11_u196	Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
s03_e18_c11_u197	Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
s03_e18_c11_u198	What?
s03_e18_c11_u199	Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
s03_e18_c11_u200	Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
s03_e18_c11_u201	Okay.
s03_e18_c11_u202	Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
s03_e18_c11_u203	Okay, but.
s03_e18_c11_u204	Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go
s03_e18_c12_u205	Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
s03_e18_c12_u206	(in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
s03_e18_c12_u207	Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
s03_e18_c12_u208	Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
s03_e18_c12_u209	I know!!
s03_e18_c12_u210	Okay, then get the lobster!
s03_e18_c12_u211	(opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!
s03_e18_c12_u212	Hi.
s03_e18_c12_u213	Hi!!
s03_e18_c12_u214	Hey!
s03_e18_c12_u215	Hi!
s03_e18_c12_u216	Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
s03_e18_c12_u217	And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.
s03_e18_c12_u218	Oh-no-no-no-no-.
s03_e18_c12_u219	Just one drink?!
s03_e18_c12_u220	(in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?
s03_e18_c12_u221	Hey, you like pizza?
s03_e18_c12_u222	Oh, that's sounds great.
s03_e18_c12_u223	I know a great little place.
s03_e18_c13_u224	You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!
s03_e18_c13_u225	Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
s03_e18_c13_u226	Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that.
s03_e18_c13_u227	Why, how much is that?
s03_e18_c13_u228	That's about 60 cents.
s03_e18_c14_u229	Every night!!
s03_e18_c14_u230	You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)
s03_e18_c15_u231	Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can.
s03_e18_c15_u232	Hi Frank.
s03_e18_c15_u233	Hi, Mrs. Knight.
s03_e18_c15_u234	Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that what it is?
s03_e18_c15_u235	Yeah, but not just that.
s03_e18_c15_u236	Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
s03_e18_c15_u237	None the less.
s03_e18_c15_u238	None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)
s03_e18_c15_u239	That's right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).
s03_e18_c16_u240	Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
s03_e18_c16_u241	(He's recorded his voice on the tape) Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
s08_e12_c01_u001	Hey! I got you a present!!
s08_e12_c01_u002	Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
s08_e12_c01_u003	I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!
s08_e12_c01_u004	Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang
s08_e12_c01_u005	(interrupting) I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!! (Monica rips open the paper.)
s08_e12_c01_u006	It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
s08_e12_c01_u007	Oh my God!
s08_e12_c01_u008	I didn't know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
s08_e12_c01_u009	Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
s08_e12_c01_u010	Oh, okay.
s08_e12_c01_u011	All right. (He goes to push it and it doesn't move.)
s08_e12_c01_u012	I kinda like it here.
s08_e12_c01_u013	Do you really like it?
s08_e12_c01_u014	Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like-Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
s08_e12_c01_u015	Oh really? What was your first?
s08_e12_c01_u016	Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.
s08_e12_c01_u017	Well what did it do?
s08_e12_c01_u018	Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
s08_e12_c01_u019	A vending machine?
s08_e12_c01_u020	Don't feel bad for me! I won like every time!
s08_e12_c02_u021	Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. I've been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
s08_e12_c02_u022	(To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
s08_e12_c02_u023	Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so-.
s08_e12_c02_u024	They made you head of the department!
s08_e12_c02_u025	No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didn't I get head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)
s08_e12_c02_u026	Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
s08_e12_c02_u027	Yeah.
s08_e12_c02_u028	I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
s08_e12_c02_u029	Uh, Paul's Cafe. They got great food and it's really romantic.
s08_e12_c02_u030	Ooh, great! Thanks!
s08_e12_c02_u031	Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing-Oh! Take her dancing!
s08_e12_c02_u032	You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya
s08_e12_c02_u033	Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
s08_e12_c02_u034	Hey, y'know what?
s08_e12_c02_u035	Huh?
s08_e12_c02_u036	Why don't I take you out?
s08_e12_c02_u037	What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
s08_e12_c02_u038	Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
s08_e12_c02_u039	(interrupting) Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.
s08_e12_c02_u040	I'll be fun.
s08_e12_c02_u041	All right?
s08_e12_c03_u042	No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
s08_e12_c03_u043	Okay, I'm next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
s08_e12_c03_u044	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
s08_e12_c03_u045	Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
s08_e12_c03_u046	Who cares? It's a stupid game.
s08_e12_c03_u047	You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
s08_e12_c03_u048	I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
s08_e12_c03_u049	Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
s08_e12_c03_u050	No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?
s08_e12_c03_u051	Why do you want to play this game so bad?
s08_e12_c03_u052	Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
s08_e12_c03_u053	Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica can't move her.) Oh come-Phoebe!
s08_e12_c04_u054	Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
s08_e12_c04_u055	No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands her some flowers.)
s08_e12_c04_u056	Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
s08_e12_c04_u057	And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so
s08_e12_c04_u058	Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about-(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly below her breasts)-there.
s08_e12_c04_u059	Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so-nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
s08_e12_c04_u060	Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.
s08_e12_c04_u061	I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
s08_e12_c04_u062	Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
s08_e12_c04_u063	Ah- Hey, so this roommate of yours-is he good looking?
s08_e12_c04_u064	Hm-mmm.
s08_e12_c04_u065	Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
s08_e12_c04_u066	(laughs) Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
s08_e12_c04_u067	No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
s08_e12_c05_u068	which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of dominance. (The bell rings.) Okay, that-that's all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
s08_e12_c05_u069	Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.
s08_e12_c05_u070	What?! That-that's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
s08_e12_c05_u071	Ooh, dude. That's not gonna happen.
s08_e12_c05_u072	Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I'm the teacher!!
s08_e12_c06_u073	Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I'm sorry I'm a little late. Ah-(Checks his watch)-Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up, I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.
s08_e12_c07_u074	Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
s08_e12_c07_u075	There's a side of steamed vegetables.
s08_e12_c07_u076	Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
s08_e12_c07_u077	Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same. (The waitress leaves.)
s08_e12_c07_u078	Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date-Oh, I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.
s08_e12_c07_u079	Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date.
s08_e12_c07_u080	Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
s08_e12_c07_u081	No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don't like me for-(Laughs.) I'm sorry I couldn't even get through that.
s08_e12_c07_u082	I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
s08_e12_c07_u083	Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
s08_e12_c07_u084	Oh my God. And that works?!
s08_e12_c07_u085	Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
s08_e12_c07_u086	Oh, you poor little famous man.
s08_e12_c07_u087	Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful-I don't think I can.
s08_e12_c07_u088	(looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
s08_e12_c07_u089	Alright, so-so tell me one of your moves.
s08_e12_c07_u090	Alright. So where'd you grow up?
s08_e12_c07_u091	That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
s08_e12_c07_u092	Come on, just answer the question!
s08_e12_c07_u093	(exasperated) Queens.
s08_e12_c07_u094	And so were-were you close to your parents?
s08_e12_c07_u095	Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
s08_e12_c07_u096	Why not?
s08_e12_c07_u097	I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance y'know-I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
s08_e12_c07_u098	(sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It's gotta be rough.
s08_e12_c07_u099	Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!
s08_e12_c07_u100	Huh?
s08_e12_c07_u101	"Where'd you grow up," it's so simple!
s08_e12_c07_u102	Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
s08_e12_c07_u103	Yeah.
s08_e12_c07_u104	And now you're watching me walk away.
s08_e12_c07_u105	Yes I am! Again so simple!
s08_e12_c08_u106	Hey.
s08_e12_c08_u107	You are not going to believe what I did today!
s08_e12_c08_u108	Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
s08_e12_c08_u109	I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don't.
s08_e12_c08_u110	Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
s08_e12_c08_u111	Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he can't straighten his fingers.)
s08_e12_c08_u112	What is the matter with your hand?
s08_e12_c08_u113	Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty words.
s08_e12_c08_u114	Chandler, why would you do that?
s08_e12_c08_u115	Because it's awesome.
s08_e12_c08_u116	You think this is clever?
s08_e12_c08_u117	Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
s08_e12_c08_u118	Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.
s08_e12_c08_u119	It is when you put it together with that one.
s08_e12_c08_u120	Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.
s08_e12_c08_u121	Come on, he won't even know what they mean.
s08_e12_c08_u122	Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.
s08_e12_c08_u123	Have you talked to him lately?
s08_e12_c08_u124	All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.
s08_e12_c08_u125	No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM (Read Only Memory, it's a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!
s08_e12_c08_u126	Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
s08_e12_c08_u127	With the claw?!
s08_e12_c08_u128	All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
s08_e12_c08_u129	(smiles) Pull my finger-(Looks at his hand)-My hand is messed up.
s08_e12_c09_u130	I am not gonna answer that!
s08_e12_c09_u131	Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
s08_e12_c09_u132	No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.
s08_e12_c09_u133	Chandler?
s08_e12_c09_u134	Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!
s08_e12_c09_u135	Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
s08_e12_c09_u136	I know!
s08_e12_c09_u137	I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
s08_e12_c09_u138	Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
s08_e12_c09_u139	I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
s08_e12_c09_u140	Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
s08_e12_c09_u141	Huh. Huh.
s08_e12_c09_u142	All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
s08_e12_c09_u143	Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)
s08_e12_c09_u144	So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?
s08_e12_c09_u145	Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
s08_e12_c09_u146	How do you do that?
s08_e12_c09_u147	Now you can't tell anyone, but uh-I put on shiny lip balm.
s08_e12_c09_u148	Oh my God!
s08_e12_c09_u149	Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
s08_e12_c09_u150	No, I don't want to tell you.
s08_e12_c09_u151	Why not?
s08_e12_c09_u152	Because it's embarrassing.
s08_e12_c09_u153	More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at him.) I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
s08_e12_c09_u154	(laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
s08_e12_c09_u155	(stunned and turned on) Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya
s08_e12_c09_u156	All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
s08_e12_c09_u157	Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then starts to freak out.)
s08_e12_c10_u158	you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
s08_e12_c10_u159	No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
s08_e12_c10_u160	Well, why didn't you just take a cab?
s08_e12_c10_u161	Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
s08_e12_c10_u162	Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
s08_e12_c10_u163	Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away from me. And-I already put it in my family newsletter.
s08_e12_c10_u164	You what?
s08_e12_c10_u165	You've seen it, the Geller Yeller.
s08_e12_c10_u166	Right. Wow!
s08_e12_c10_u167	Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can make it this time. I just-I just can't be afraid to get a little bit-hit by cars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)
s08_e12_c10_u168	Hey!
s08_e12_c10_u169	Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
s08_e12_c10_u170	Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
s08_e12_c10_u171	Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
s08_e12_c10_u172	Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
s08_e12_c10_u173	Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
s08_e12_c10_u174	Oh yeah? All right, let's do it tonight.
s08_e12_c10_u175	Well don't you have that big date tonight?
s08_e12_c10_u176	Oh right!
s08_e12_c10_u177	Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
s08_e12_c10_u178	Yeah.
s08_e12_c10_u179	After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
s08_e12_c10_u180	Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
s08_e12_c10_u181	I don't know! (Pause) I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster
s08_e12_c10_u182	Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
s08_e12_c10_u183	Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
s08_e12_c10_u184	Yeah me too, all night.
s08_e12_c10_u185	Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
s08_e12_c10_u186	Yeah well that's because uh-I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
s08_e12_c11_u187	Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It's got-Right-(She dies.) Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?
s08_e12_c11_u188	(entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before-(Sees the top ten list)-Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
s08_e12_c11_u189	They're all Chandler.
s08_e12_c11_u190	Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!
s08_e12_c11_u191	I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.
s08_e12_c11_u192	But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.
s08_e12_c11_u193	Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both look at him.) Was it just me?!
s08_e12_c12_u194	Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I'm on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay, why don't we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where- (Exhales again) Where you will see-a uh-a bunch of uh-red spots. Okay, (Closes his book.) umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I-(Passes out and collapses.)
s08_e12_c13_u195	Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
s08_e12_c13_u196	No-no! I'm fine. It's just- Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly-suddenly see them a different way?
s08_e12_c13_u197	You mean like from behind?
s08_e12_c13_u198	Yeah. Yeah, that-that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.
s08_e12_c13_u199	Ew, y'know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
s08_e12_c13_u200	(deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
s08_e12_c13_u201	Totally! Wow! (Pause) Would you excuse me for a sec?
s08_e12_c13_u202	Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches her go.) Ehhh.
s08_e12_c14_u203	Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!
s08_e12_c14_u204	I know!
s08_e12_c14_u205	One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)
s08_e12_c14_u206	Don't touch me!!
s08_e12_c14_u207	Don't touch her!!
s08_e12_c14_u208	All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
s08_e12_c14_u209	I can't!! I can't!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
s08_e12_c14_u210	Phoebe!!
s08_e12_c14_u211	Oh hi Ben-No!! Don't look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)
s08_e12_c15_u212	Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
s08_e12_c15_u213	(incredulous) Alone?!
s08_e12_c15_u214	Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
s08_e12_c15_u215	Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?
s08_e12_c15_u216	No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
s08_e12_c15_u217	Oh uh, it didn't work out.
s08_e12_c15_u218	Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
s08_e12_c15_u219	Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
s08_e12_c15_u220	Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel who's in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
s08_e12_c15_u221	Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)
s08_e12_c15_u222	Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
s08_e12_c15_u223	All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
s08_e12_c15_u224	Oh my God-.What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! (Drags Joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?
s08_e12_c15_u225	Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)
s08_e12_c16_u226	So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we see why he made it to class on time, he's wearing in-line skates and hasn't taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs
s07_e01_c01_u001	Hey, what's going on?
s07_e01_c01_u002	Hey.
s07_e01_c01_u003	I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."
s07_e01_c01_u004	(grabbing the candy bar) Yeah I'll take that.
s07_e01_c01_u005	What's up?
s07_e01_c01_u006	Monica and I are engaged.
s07_e01_c01_u007	Oh my God. (Hugs Chandler.) Congratulations.
s07_e01_c01_u008	Thanks.
s07_e01_c01_u009	Where is she?
s07_e01_c01_u010	(yelling at the top of her lungs) I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
s07_e01_c01_u011	Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
s07_e01_c01_u012	Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!" Can I bring her in?
s07_e01_c01_u013	Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet.
s07_e01_c01_u014	I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! (Someone else yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.) Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!
s07_e01_c01_u015	(To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet.
s07_e01_c02_u016	Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say that-I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!
s07_e01_c02_u017	It's okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.
s07_e01_c02_u018	Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica.
s07_e01_c02_u019	To Monica!
s07_e01_c02_u020	So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
s07_e01_c02_u021	Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to
s07_e01_c02_u022	Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
s07_e01_c02_u023	(To Monica) Yeah, you're on your own.
s07_e01_c02_u024	Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
s07_e01_c02_u025	But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?
s07_e01_c02_u026	So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
s07_e01_c02_u027	You guys don't think I look 19?
s07_e01_c02_u028	Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
s07_e01_c02_u029	Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
s07_e01_c02_u030	Okay.
s07_e01_c02_u031	Okay.
s07_e01_c02_u032	(To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
s07_e01_c02_u033	Oh honey no, you ate it all.
s07_e01_c02_u034	I was afraid of that.
s07_e01_c03_u035	(looking at her hand) Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) You're not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)
s07_e01_c03_u036	Know what I mean?
s07_e01_c03_u037	Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
s07_e01_c03_u038	There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
s07_e01_c03_u039	(lustily) Let's do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)
s07_e01_c04_u040	(chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
s07_e01_c04_u041	(motioning with his hands) I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)
s07_e01_c04_u042	Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)
s07_e01_c04_u043	Phoebe!
s07_e01_c04_u044	If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
s07_e01_c05_u045	Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. (Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!
s07_e01_c05_u046	Hey!
s07_e01_c05_u047	You look great!
s07_e01_c05_u048	(quietly) Oh, thanks.
s07_e01_c05_u049	You okay over there?
s07_e01_c05_u050	I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm- No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.
s07_e01_c05_u051	Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
s07_e01_c05_u052	Hey!
s07_e01_c05_u053	Hi!
s07_e01_c05_u054	Wow! Happy Monica's night!
s07_e01_c05_u055	Well thank you, you too.
s07_e01_c05_u056	Thanks.
s07_e01_c05_u057	Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
s07_e01_c05_u058	Well sure. But I get married all the time so
s07_e01_c05_u059	Ohh
s07_e01_c05_u060	You okay?
s07_e01_c05_u061	Yeah, I guess. I-I- I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
s07_e01_c05_u062	You mean, we-you and me?
s07_e01_c05_u063	Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
s07_e01_c05_u064	Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
s07_e01_c05_u065	Shake it off.
s07_e01_c05_u066	I mean-no, it's just cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.
s07_e01_c05_u067	No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm
s07_e01_c05_u068	Surely you can think of something good.
s07_e01_c05_u069	Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
s07_e01_c05_u070	What?
s07_e01_c05_u071	Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
s07_e01_c05_u072	Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
s07_e01_c05_u073	Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
s07_e01_c05_u074	My hands?
s07_e01_c05_u075	Yeah.
s07_e01_c05_u076	Yeah?
s07_e01_c05_u077	Uh-huh.
s07_e01_c05_u078	(to his hands) Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
s07_e01_c05_u079	Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had bonus night!
s07_e01_c05_u080	A what?
s07_e01_c05_u081	Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
s07_e01_c05_u082	One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
s07_e01_c05_u083	Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
s07_e01_c05_u084	No.
s07_e01_c05_u085	Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I-gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really-don't.
s07_e01_c06_u086	Sup? Sup dude?
s07_e01_c06_u087	(putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
s07_e01_c06_u088	So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! Sup with the whack Playstation, sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
s07_e01_c06_u089	Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
s07_e01_c06_u090	Come on man, really how old?!
s07_e01_c06_u091	Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
s07_e01_c06_u092	Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)
s07_e01_c06_u093	Joe?
s07_e01_c06_u094	Yeah!
s07_e01_c06_u095	Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
s07_e01_c06_u096	When? Today? Some, not a lot.
s07_e01_c06_u097	Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't-. There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
s07_e01_c06_u098	Don't worry about that man, that happens.
s07_e01_c06_u099	It's happened to you?
s07_e01_c06_u100	Yeah! Once.
s07_e01_c06_u101	Well, what'd you do?
s07_e01_c06_u102	I did it anyway.
s07_e01_c07_u103	Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why aren't you dressed yet?!
s07_e01_c07_u104	I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)
s07_e01_c07_u105	(grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
s07_e01_c07_u106	Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
s07_e01_c07_u107	Fair enough, now go get ready!
s07_e01_c07_u108	Okay. (She goes to get ready.)
s07_e01_c07_u109	I'll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating my-(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.) I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
s07_e01_c08_u110	Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw
s07_e01_c08_u111	(interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
s07_e01_c08_u112	What?
s07_e01_c08_u113	See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
s07_e01_c08_u114	Oh honey, but it is just about
s07_e01_c08_u115	It is! It is!
s07_e01_c08_u116	No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
s07_e01_c08_u117	What?!
s07_e01_c08_u118	See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
s07_e01_c08_u119	Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
s07_e01_c08_u120	Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
s07_e01_c08_u121	Yeah!
s07_e01_c08_u122	That's true.
s07_e01_c08_u123	Honey I swear it we just kissed.
s07_e01_c08_u124	It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)
s07_e01_c08_u125	You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
s07_e01_c08_u126	Thunder being stolen!!
s07_e01_c08_u127	Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
s07_e01_c08_u128	Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
s07_e01_c08_u129	Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
s07_e01_c08_u130	(angrily) I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
s07_e01_c08_u131	What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed- (Points to Ross and Rachel.)
s07_e01_c08_u132	What?
s07_e01_c08_u133	What?!
s07_e01_c08_u134	You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
s07_e01_c08_u135	No!
s07_e01_c08_u136	Oh no!
s07_e01_c08_u137	No-no, it's really not huge.
s07_e01_c08_u138	And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!
s07_e01_c08_u139	Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
s07_e01_c08_u140	Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
s07_e01_c08_u141	Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
s07_e01_c08_u142	Yes that would be lovely.
s07_e01_c08_u143	You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
s07_e01_c08_u144	Yes, you can pass for 19.
s07_e01_c08_u145	Really?
s07_e01_c08_u146	Yes!
s07_e01_c08_u147	Seriously?
s07_e01_c08_u148	Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
s07_e01_c08_u149	(gasps) I'm 30!
s07_e01_c08_u150	Joey, you are not! You're 31.
s07_e01_c08_u151	(realizes) Aww crap!
s07_e01_c08_u152	Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.
s07_e01_c08_u153	Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
s07_e01_c08_u154	Why?!
s07_e01_c08_u155	Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look
s07_e01_c08_u156	No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! (To Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)
s07_e01_c08_u157	Psss, that is whack!
s07_e01_c08_u158	(she's strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
s07_e01_c08_u159	Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
s07_e01_c08_u160	Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
s07_e01_c08_u161	Wouldn't she?
s07_e01_c08_u162	Would she?
s07_e01_c08_u163	Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You ate my candy bar!
s07_e01_c09_u164	Guess who? (Enters fully.)
s07_e01_c09_u165	Hey.
s07_e01_c09_u166	Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air
s07_e01_c09_u167	What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
s07_e01_c09_u168	Still thinking about it huh?
s07_e01_c09_u169	Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!
s07_e01_c09_u170	(loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?
s07_e01_c09_u171	I care!
s07_e01_c09_u172	(tightening his tie) And so do I.
s07_e01_c09_u173	Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
s07_e01_c09_u174	Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)
s07_e01_c09_u175	Am I going to let you watch me undress?
s07_e01_c09_u176	(sitting up) No! (Exits.)
s07_e01_c10_u177	I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
s07_e01_c10_u178	Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
s07_e01_c10_u179	Paris?
s07_e01_c10_u180	We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
s07_e01_c10_u181	Keep talking.
s07_e01_c10_u182	Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
s07_e01_c10_u183	I love you!
s07_e01_c10_u184	(in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.
s07_e01_c10_u185	Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
s07_e01_c10_u186	It's Paris, who knows we're here!
s07_e01_c10_u187	(opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what's up? (She enters.)
s07_e01_c10_u188	Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
s07_e01_c10_u189	What?!
s07_e01_c10_u190	Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
s07_e01_c10_u191	Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
s07_e01_c10_u192	Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)
s07_e01_c10_u193	They break your heart, don't they?
s07_e01_c10_u194	Y'know, I don't really their permission.
s07_e01_c10_u195	Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
s07_e01_c10_u196	Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you- You gotta do something about your eyes.
s07_e01_c10_u197	What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
s07_e01_c10_u198	They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
s07_e01_c10_u199	And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
s07_e01_c10_u200	Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
s07_e01_c10_u201	Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
s07_e01_c10_u202	Yes.
s07_e01_c10_u203	Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
s07_e01_c10_u204	What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
s07_e01_c10_u205	No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
s07_e01_c10_u206	Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
s07_e01_c10_u207	What?!
s07_e01_c10_u208	(To Rachel) Hey, here's a thought.
s07_e01_c10_u209	Monica, what are you talking about?
s07_e01_c10_u210	My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
s07_e01_c10_u211	(entering) Ahh, third base.
s07_e01_c10_u212	It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
s07_e01_c10_u213	Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
s07_e01_c10_u214	(gasps) We had a characturist!
s07_e01_c10_u215	Oh!!
s07_e01_c10_u216	(singing, angrily)
s07_e01_c10_u217	Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
s07_e01_c10_u218	And yet, here we are doing it again.
s07_e01_c10_u219	Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
s07_e01_c10_u220	Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
s07_e01_c10_u221	Got me. (He shows of his hands.)
s07_e01_c10_u222	All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
s07_e01_c10_u223	I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
s07_e01_c10_u224	I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
s07_e01_c10_u225	Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
s07_e01_c10_u226	Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
s07_e01_c10_u227	(To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
s07_e01_c10_u228	(ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
s07_e01_c10_u229	I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
s07_e01_c10_u230	Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
s07_e01_c10_u231	(yelling after them) I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
s07_e01_c10_u232	Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
s07_e01_c10_u233	Look uh, if we're gonna do this
s07_e01_c10_u234	We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
s07_e01_c10_u235	Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
s07_e01_c10_u236	Who is it?
s07_e01_c10_u237	(outside the door) It's Monica, open up!
s07_e01_c10_u238	Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)
s07_e01_c10_u239	Oww!
s07_e01_c10_u240	Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?
s07_e01_c10_u241	I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
s07_e01_c10_u242	How is that ever going to happen?!
s07_e01_c10_u243	All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
s07_e01_c10_u244	I know why!
s07_e01_c10_u245	No you don't know why!
s07_e01_c10_u246	Okay! Why?!
s07_e01_c10_u247	Because! Because I was sad.
s07_e01_c10_u248	What do you mean?
s07_e01_c10_u249	Look, I am so-so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
s07_e01_c10_u250	(To Ross) I don't care, she slept with me.
s07_e01_c10_u251	Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
s07_e01_c10_u252	(starting to cry) I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)
s07_e01_c10_u253	(deadpan) Well, I'm going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.
s07_e01_c10_u254	Thanks.
s07_e01_c10_u255	(at the door) And uh, Rachel.
s07_e01_c10_u256	Yeah.
s07_e01_c10_u257	What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)
s07_e01_c11_u258	(singing)
s07_e01_c11_u259	(interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
s07_e01_c11_u260	Oh thank you.
s07_e01_c11_u261	Okay. (Goes back to bed.)
s07_e01_c11_u262	Now- (Starts singing again) "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer-(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the door behind him)-Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
s05_e20_c01_u001	Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
s05_e20_c01_u002	Oh, yeah, good idea.
s05_e20_c01_u003	Hey man, what's up?
s05_e20_c01_u004	(sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. (Joey panics.)
s05_e20_c01_u005	Ooh, Ross, look! Look! (Points behind Ross.)
s05_e20_c01_u006	(turning and looking) What? Where?
s05_e20_c01_u007	Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
s05_e20_c01_u008	What am I looking at?
s05_e20_c01_u009	(to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!
s05_e20_c01_u010	(entering, with Gary) Hey!
s05_e20_c01_u011	Hello!
s05_e20_c01_u012	Hey!
s05_e20_c01_u013	How are you?
s05_e20_c01_u014	Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
s05_e20_c01_u015	You got to go on a ride along?!
s05_e20_c01_u016	Uh-huh!
s05_e20_c01_u017	I want to go on a ride along!
s05_e20_c01_u018	Me too!
s05_e20_c01_u019	Okay!
s05_e20_c01_u020	Yeah, yeah! Me too!
s05_e20_c01_u021	Really?! You?
s05_e20_c01_u022	Yeah.
s05_e20_c01_u023	Well, it's kinda dangerous.
s05_e20_c01_u024	Well, I like danger.
s05_e20_c01_u025	Okay, you guys free tonight?
s05_e20_c01_u026	Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
s05_e20_c02_u027	Hey!
s05_e20_c02_u028	Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
s05_e20_c02_u029	Ohh, thank God! Finally!
s05_e20_c02_u030	Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know- And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)
s05_e20_c02_u031	Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
s05_e20_c02_u032	You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
s05_e20_c02_u033	Great! Thanks!
s05_e20_c02_u034	All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
s05_e20_c02_u035	Okay.
s05_e20_c02_u036	Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
s05_e20_c02_u037	I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
s05_e20_c02_u038	Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
s05_e20_c02_u039	Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
s05_e20_c02_u040	No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
s05_e20_c02_u041	All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
s05_e20_c02_u042	Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
s05_e20_c02_u043	Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around
s05_e20_c02_u044	What?!
s05_e20_c02_u045	What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
s05_e20_c03_u046	(to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
s05_e20_c03_u047	It is starting to get dark out there.
s05_e20_c03_u048	(to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
s05_e20_c03_u049	Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
s05_e20_c03_u050	(laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
s05_e20_c03_u051	Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
s05_e20_c03_u052	It's called the cherry.
s05_e20_c03_u053	It's the-Chandler!!
s05_e20_c03_u054	(returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
s05_e20_c03_u055	Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
s05_e20_c03_u056	Oh-ho, yeah!
s05_e20_c03_u057	Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
s05_e20_c03_u058	Yep!
s05_e20_c03_u059	Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
s05_e20_c03_u060	(dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
s05_e20_c03_u061	Your tax dollars?
s05_e20_c03_u062	Yeah, okay.
s05_e20_c03_u063	(leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
s05_e20_c03_u064	Did I say you could smell it?!
s05_e20_c03_u065	I can't smell your sandwich?
s05_e20_c03_u066	Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
s05_e20_c03_u067	Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
s05_e20_c03_u068	Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
s05_e20_c03_u069	Okay.
s05_e20_c03_u070	Are you thinking about Monica?
s05_e20_c03_u071	Yeah.
s05_e20_c03_u072	Yeah, what's that like?
s05_e20_c04_u073	Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)
s05_e20_c04_u074	(on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!
s05_e20_c04_u075	Hey! What's up?!
s05_e20_c04_u076	I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
s05_e20_c04_u077	So all we have is ice?
s05_e20_c04_u078	See if he has ice.
s05_e20_c04_u079	Okay.
s05_e20_c04_u080	(on answering machine) Hello Ross? It's Emily. (Rachel runs back into the room with the tequila.) I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
s05_e20_c04_u081	Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)
s05_e20_c05_u082	So where are we going next?
s05_e20_c05_u083	This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
s05_e20_c05_u084	Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
s05_e20_c05_u085	Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
s05_e20_c05_u086	It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
s05_e20_c05_u087	Yeah, no one talks like that!
s05_e20_c05_u088	Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
s05_e20_c05_u089	Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
s05_e20_c05_u090	How do you figure that?
s05_e20_c05_u091	Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
s05_e20_c05_u092	Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
s05_e20_c05_u093	Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)
s05_e20_c05_u094	Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
s05_e20_c05_u095	Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)
s05_e20_c05_u096	Ross!
s05_e20_c05_u097	Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
s05_e20_c05_u098	Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
s05_e20_c05_u099	Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
s05_e20_c06_u100	(on answering machine) Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
s05_e20_c06_u101	(does Rachel's) Nooo!
s05_e20_c06_u102	(does Monica's) I know!
s05_e20_c06_u103	Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
s05_e20_c06_u104	What?! We can't do that!
s05_e20_c06_u105	We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
s05_e20_c06_u106	Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
s05_e20_c06_u107	I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
s05_e20_c06_u108	I don't think he's the one who needs help.
s05_e20_c06_u109	No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
s05_e20_c06_u110	Ugh!
s05_e20_c06_u111	Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
s05_e20_c06_u112	Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)
s05_e20_c06_u113	Noooooooo!
s05_e20_c07_u114	Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
s05_e20_c07_u115	No. But that reminds me, (handing back a clipboard) sign this.
s05_e20_c07_u116	What is it?
s05_e20_c07_u117	Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
s05_e20_c07_u118	(deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
s05_e20_c07_u119	Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
s05_e20_c07_u120	What? What? What? What is it?
s05_e20_c07_u121	Is everything okay?
s05_e20_c07_u122	What's going on?
s05_e20_c07_u123	Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
s05_e20_c07_u124	Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. (Joey slowly moves off of Ross.) Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
s05_e20_c07_u125	(To Ross) You okay man?
s05_e20_c07_u126	Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
s05_e20_c07_u127	Uh, HELLO!!
s05_e20_c07_u128	Hi.
s05_e20_c08_u129	All right, I guess we should go.
s05_e20_c08_u130	No, wait. Wait.
s05_e20_c08_u131	Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)
s05_e20_c08_u132	No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
s05_e20_c08_u133	There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
s05_e20_c08_u134	Yeah well unless we tell him.
s05_e20_c08_u135	Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
s05_e20_c08_u136	Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
s05_e20_c08_u137	(on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)
s05_e20_c08_u138	Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
s05_e20_c08_u139	Right?
s05_e20_c09_u140	Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
s05_e20_c09_u141	(excited) John Glenn is here?!
s05_e20_c09_u142	No, Joey!
s05_e20_c09_u143	Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car
s05_e20_c09_u144	Wait! Hold on! (He goes over to Phoebe and gives her a kiss.) (To Phoebe) Hi!
s05_e20_c09_u145	Hi!
s05_e20_c09_u146	(To Ross) Okay, go ahead.
s05_e20_c09_u147	Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
s05_e20_c09_u148	My God, Joey!
s05_e20_c09_u149	(pouting) It was a car backfire!
s05_e20_c09_u150	Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
s05_e20_c09_u151	Yeah, I didn't know that.
s05_e20_c09_u152	And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
s05_e20_c09_u153	Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
s05_e20_c09_u154	Who jumps at loud noises!
s05_e20_c09_u155	Wow! I could've died tonight.
s05_e20_c09_u156	Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)
s05_e20_c09_u157	I do have a newfound respect for life.
s05_e20_c09_u158	(returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
s05_e20_c09_u159	(To Phoebe) So you wanna get some dinner?
s05_e20_c09_u160	Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
s05_e20_c09_u161	Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
s05_e20_c09_u162	Okay!
s05_e20_c09_u163	All right.
s05_e20_c09_u164	Bye!
s05_e20_c09_u165	Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
s05_e20_c10_u166	Dude! How come you took off?
s05_e20_c10_u167	Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever
s05_e20_c10_u168	Is something wrong?
s05_e20_c10_u169	No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
s05_e20_c10_u170	Okay.
s05_e20_c10_u171	You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
s05_e20_c10_u172	That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
s05_e20_c10_u173	I do not hate Ross!
s05_e20_c10_u174	Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
s05_e20_c10_u175	What picture?
s05_e20_c10_u176	I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
s05_e20_c10_u177	Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
s05_e20_c10_u178	Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I-knew-you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
s05_e20_c10_u179	When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
s05_e20_c10_u180	Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
s05_e20_c10_u181	From a bullet!
s05_e20_c10_u182	I know it doesn't make much sense
s05_e20_c10_u183	Much sense?!
s05_e20_c10_u184	Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
s05_e20_c10_u185	So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
s05_e20_c10_u186	I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!
s05_e20_c10_u187	So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
s05_e20_c10_u188	No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
s05_e20_c10_u189	Really?!
s05_e20_c10_u190	Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for Chandler) here.
s05_e20_c10_u191	Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
s05_e20_c10_u192	No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
s05_e20_c10_u193	How good is that?
s05_e20_c10_u194	(with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
s05_e20_c10_u195	See?
s05_e20_c10_u196	Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
s05_e20_c10_u197	Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
s05_e20_c10_u198	I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
s05_e20_c10_u199	Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!
s05_e20_c11_u200	Hey! Hi!
s05_e20_c11_u201	Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
s05_e20_c11_u202	Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
s05_e20_c11_u203	Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)
s05_e20_c11_u204	Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
s05_e20_c11_u205	The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
s05_e20_c11_u206	What?! What? What happened?!
s05_e20_c11_u207	Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
s05_e20_c11_u208	Yeah!
s05_e20_c11_u209	And somebody took a shot at me!
s05_e20_c11_u210	(gasps) Really?!
s05_e20_c11_u211	No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I-I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
s05_e20_c11_u212	Because a car backfired?
s05_e20_c11_u213	(stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?
s05_e20_c11_u214	Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
s05_e20_c11_u215	You talked to her?
s05_e20_c11_u216	No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.
s05_e20_c11_u217	Well, okay, what-what did she say?
s05_e20_c11_u218	Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
s05_e20_c11_u219	Wow!
s05_e20_c11_u220	Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
s05_e20_c11_u221	Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
s05_e20_c11_u222	Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision.
s05_e20_c11_u223	Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
s05_e20_c11_u224	Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
s05_e20_c11_u225	Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
s05_e20_c11_u226	Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
s05_e20_c11_u227	You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
s05_e20_c11_u228	Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
s05_e20_c11_u229	Huh.
s05_e20_c11_u230	I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
s05_e20_c11_u231	That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
s05_e20_c11_u232	Well, there you go!
s05_e20_c11_u233	Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
s05_e20_c11_u234	(laughing) Close call day.
s05_e20_c11_u235	Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)
s05_e20_c11_u236	Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)
s05_e20_c11_u237	Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
s05_e20_c11_u238	Oh?
s05_e20_c11_u239	(on machine) "Hey Ross, it's you!" (Hits the stop button) Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
s05_e20_c11_u240	No. (She heads for the door again.)
s05_e20_c11_u241	(looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
s05_e20_c11_u242	Yeah.
s05_e20_c11_u243	Yeah, I want my money back.
s05_e20_c11_u244	(going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
s05_e20_c12_u245	Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
s05_e20_c12_u246	Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
s05_e20_c12_u247	I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
s05_e20_c12_u248	Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
s05_e20_c12_u249	Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
s05_e20_c12_u250	I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
s05_e20_c12_u251	Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
s05_e20_c12_u252	Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)
s05_e20_c12_u253	Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.
s06_e09_c01_u001	(on phone) Okay, great! Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
s06_e09_c01_u002	Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
s06_e09_c01_u003	(not amused by Chandler's joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.
s06_e09_c01_u004	Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
s06_e09_c01_u005	Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.
s06_e09_c01_u006	(shocked at the news) Why can't I tell them that we live together?
s06_e09_c01_u007	Because they don't know we're dating. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)
s06_e09_c01_u008	Why haven't you told them?!
s06_e09_c01_u009	Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
s06_e09_c01_u010	Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
s06_e09_c01_u011	(trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)
s06_e09_c01_u012	Why wouldn't they be happy?
s06_e09_c01_u013	Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
s06_e09_c01_u014	What? What? Why?!
s06_e09_c01_u015	Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
s06_e09_c01_u016	Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
s06_e09_c01_u017	Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
s06_e09_c01_u018	Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell em.
s06_e09_c01_u019	You really think that'll work?
s06_e09_c01_u020	Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
s06_e09_c01_u021	(hugging Chandler) I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
s06_e09_c02_u022	Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
s06_e09_c02_u023	(only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!
s06_e09_c02_u024	Well Monica just told me that they don't.
s06_e09_c02_u025	(not paying attention) Yeah, they don't like you.
s06_e09_c02_u026	(annoyed) Do you know why?
s06_e09_c02_u027	I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
s06_e09_c02_u028	(angry) Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
s06_e09_c02_u029	This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
s06_e09_c02_u030	Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
s06_e09_c02_u031	Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
s06_e09_c02_u032	Well maybe I love ya'.
s06_e09_c02_u033	[mocks that last comment].
s06_e09_c02_u034	Hey.
s06_e09_c02_u035	Hey guys!
s06_e09_c02_u036	Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
s06_e09_c02_u037	Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
s06_e09_c02_u038	Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
s06_e09_c02_u039	For real?
s06_e09_c02_u040	No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
s06_e09_c02_u041	Ye-ye, we go to yours!
s06_e09_c02_u042	Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
s06_e09_c02_u043	(not sure of what to make of that) Okay.
s06_e09_c02_u044	How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
s06_e09_c03_u045	Hey!
s06_e09_c03_u046	Hey!
s06_e09_c03_u047	Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
s06_e09_c03_u048	Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is...[about to say bad] so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
s06_e09_c03_u049	Nothing.
s06_e09_c03_u050	No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
s06_e09_c03_u051	So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
s06_e09_c03_u052	You're not gonna mess it up.
s06_e09_c03_u053	Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
s06_e09_c03_u054	Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
s06_e09_c03_u055	Hey!
s06_e09_c03_u056	Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
s06_e09_c03_u057	And the place looks so nice!
s06_e09_c03_u058	Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
s06_e09_c03_u059	Happy Thanksgiving!
s06_e09_c03_u060	Well, this has been great!
s06_e09_c03_u061	See ya!
s06_e09_c03_u062	Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
s06_e09_c03_u063	Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
s06_e09_c03_u064	Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
s06_e09_c03_u065	Some would say she's attractive, yes.
s06_e09_c03_u066	And who else is going to be there?
s06_e09_c03_u067	Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
s06_e09_c03_u068	Her dancer friends?
s06_e09_c03_u069	(frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
s06_e09_c03_u070	(to Joey) Dude, we were good!
s06_e09_c03_u071	You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
s06_e09_c03_u072	Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
s06_e09_c03_u073	Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
s06_e09_c03_u074	Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
s06_e09_c03_u075	Hello everybody!
s06_e09_c03_u076	Hi!
s06_e09_c03_u077	Hi!
s06_e09_c03_u078	Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
s06_e09_c03_u079	(less than pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
s06_e09_c03_u080	Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
s06_e09_c03_u081	Whoa, snowing out there?
s06_e09_c03_u082	(angry) No.
s06_e09_c03_u083	Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
s06_e09_c03_u084	Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
s06_e09_c03_u085	Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
s06_e09_c03_u086	My joke wasn't funny.
s06_e09_c03_u087	Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
s06_e09_c03_u088	Really?!
s06_e09_c03_u089	Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad and now he's he's Jack Geller, dream hunk."
s06_e09_c03_u090	I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing.
s06_e09_c03_u091	Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
s06_e09_c03_u092	Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
s06_e09_c03_u093	I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
s06_e09_c03_u094	(worried) He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
s06_e09_c03_u095	Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
s06_e09_c03_u096	(looking at her truffle) Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
s06_e09_c03_u097	Yeah, yeah, what is it?
s06_e09_c03_u098	It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something's wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
s06_e09_c03_u099	W-What was the one right before bananas?
s06_e09_c03_u100	The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought well, there's mincemeat pie, I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
s06_e09_c03_u101	Y-sure!
s06_e09_c03_u102	Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
s06_e09_c03_u103	I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
s06_e09_c03_u104	Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
s06_e09_c03_u105	(turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!
s06_e09_c03_u106	Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
s06_e09_c03_u107	(sad) Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
s06_e09_c03_u108	No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
s06_e09_c03_u109	Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
s06_e09_c03_u110	Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
s06_e09_c03_u111	(shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are funny...
s06_e09_c03_u112	Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
s06_e09_c03_u113	Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
s06_e09_c03_u114	No!
s06_e09_c03_u115	Rachel?
s06_e09_c03_u116	Yeah?
s06_e09_c03_u117	Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.
s06_e09_c03_u118	Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
s06_e09_c03_u119	Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
s06_e09_c03_u120	Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]
s06_e09_c03_u121	What's the matter with him?
s06_e09_c03_u122	(whispers to Jack a little loudly) I think he's stoned again.
s06_e09_c03_u123	(shocked) What?
s06_e09_c03_u124	(worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
s06_e09_c04_u125	Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
s06_e09_c04_u126	You do? Why?
s06_e09_c04_u127	Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
s06_e09_c04_u128	What?! Why did you do that?
s06_e09_c04_u129	I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
s06_e09_c04_u130	How could it not matter?!
s06_e09_c04_u131	How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
s06_e09_c04_u132	What about all that friends forever stuff?
s06_e09_c04_u133	I don't know, I-I was all high.
s06_e09_c05_u134	Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!
s06_e09_c05_u135	Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
s06_e09_c05_u136	Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
s06_e09_c05_u137	The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
s06_e09_c05_u138	Okay, okay, I'll tell em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
s06_e09_c05_u139	You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
s06_e09_c05_u140	Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
s06_e09_c06_u141	Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
s06_e09_c06_u142	Monica, leave him alone!
s06_e09_c06_u143	(to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
s06_e09_c06_u144	(sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
s06_e09_c06_u145	Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
s06_e09_c06_u146	Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
s06_e09_c06_u147	So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
s06_e09_c06_u148	Oh I am!
s06_e09_c06_u149	Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
s06_e09_c06_u150	Okay, fine!
s06_e09_c06_u151	Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
s06_e09_c06_u152	Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
s06_e09_c07_u153	Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
s06_e09_c07_u154	What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
s06_e09_c07_u155	Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
s06_e09_c07_u156	Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! (Referring to the dancers.)
s06_e09_c07_u157	(scolding) Dude, they're not objects.
s06_e09_c07_u158	Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
s06_e09_c07_u159	Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
s06_e09_c07_u160	Okay...
s06_e09_c07_u161	What's up, Ross?
s06_e09_c07_u162	So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
s06_e09_c07_u163	Yeah!
s06_e09_c07_u164	And um...You look nice today.
s06_e09_c07_u165	Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
s06_e09_c07_u166	What?
s06_e09_c07_u167	I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
s06_e09_c07_u168	(shocked) Eh?
s06_e09_c07_u169	I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
s06_e09_c07_u170	(cutting her off) You're alone.
s06_e09_c07_u171	No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
s06_e09_c07_u172	(just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
s06_e09_c07_u173	Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to indicate to Ross that he's not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?
s06_e09_c07_u174	Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
s06_e09_c07_u175	Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
s06_e09_c07_u176	Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
s06_e09_c07_u177	(happily) Really?
s06_e09_c07_u178	No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
s06_e09_c07_u179	So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
s06_e09_c07_u180	It sure is.
s06_e09_c07_u181	Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
s06_e09_c07_u182	Beef.
s06_e09_c07_u183	I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. (Faking dissapointment.) Ohhh no.
s06_e09_c07_u184	Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
s06_e09_c07_u185	Really?
s06_e09_c07_u186	Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
s06_e09_c07_u187	Okay.
s06_e09_c07_u188	Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
s06_e09_c07_u189	Well?
s06_e09_c07_u190	(faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said) Mmmm! It's good!
s06_e09_c07_u191	Really? How good?
s06_e09_c07_u192	It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
s06_e09_c07_u193	(faking enjoyment) Mmm.
s06_e09_c07_u194	(clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
s06_e09_c07_u195	(lying) I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
s06_e09_c07_u196	(also lying) I'll help you dial.
s06_e09_c07_u197	(again, lying) I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
s06_e09_c07_u198	Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
s06_e09_c07_u199	Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like he's going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
s06_e09_c07_u200	It tastes like feet!
s06_e09_c07_u201	I like it.
s06_e09_c07_u202	Are you kidding?
s06_e09_c07_u203	What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
s06_e09_c07_u204	...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
s06_e09_c07_u205	(lying) Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
s06_e09_c07_u206	Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
s06_e09_c07_u207	Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
s06_e09_c07_u208	I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
s06_e09_c07_u209	(humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
s06_e09_c07_u210	Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
s06_e09_c07_u211	Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
s06_e09_c07_u212	Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
s06_e09_c07_u213	Ross? Let's go.
s06_e09_c07_u214	Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
s06_e09_c07_u215	Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
s06_e09_c07_u216	Wha-what?
s06_e09_c07_u217	(out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
s06_e09_c07_u218	(in a 5 year old's tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
s06_e09_c07_u219	Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
s06_e09_c07_u220	It was you?
s06_e09_c07_u221	And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
s06_e09_c07_u222	Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
s06_e09_c07_u223	Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
s06_e09_c07_u224	Monica and Chandler are living together!
s06_e09_c07_u225	Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
s06_e09_c07_u226	(joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!
s06_e09_c07_u227	(reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
s06_e09_c07_u228	(pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!
s06_e09_c07_u229	(rubbing her temples) That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.) Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
s06_e09_c07_u230	And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
s06_e09_c07_u231	Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
s06_e09_c07_u232	What happened son?
s06_e09_c07_u233	I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
s06_e09_c07_u234	Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. (Ross gets disgusted.) And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
s06_e09_c07_u235	Thank you!
s06_e09_c07_u236	No! Thank you! (Hugs Chandler) Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
s06_e09_c07_u237	(In a parent-like tone) I'll talk to them!
s06_e09_c08_u238	You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
s06_e09_c08_u239	Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
s06_e09_c08_u240	No it isn't, I ate that.
s06_e09_c08_u241	(pointing to herself and Jack) Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
s06_e09_c08_u242	Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too.
s01_e13_c01_u001	That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
s01_e13_c01_u002	I'm sorry!
s01_e13_c01_u003	You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
s01_e13_c01_u004	Rachel, wait, wait.
s01_e13_c01_u005	No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
s01_e13_c01_u006	Can I just say one thing?
s01_e13_c01_u007	What? What?!
s01_e13_c01_u008	That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
s01_e13_c01_u009	Oh!!
s01_e13_c02_u010	Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
s01_e13_c02_u011	That's pretty much it.
s01_e13_c02_u012	Oops!
s01_e13_c02_u013	But you tell it really well, sweetie.
s01_e13_c02_u014	Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
s01_e13_c02_u015	Okay. I'll miss you.
s01_e13_c02_u016	Isn't he great?
s01_e13_c02_u017	He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
s01_e13_c02_u018	I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
s01_e13_c02_u019	So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
s01_e13_c02_u020	Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
s01_e13_c02_u021	Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?
s01_e13_c02_u022	Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)
s01_e13_c02_u023	No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
s01_e13_c02_u024	Okay.
s01_e13_c02_u025	Did I, uh, did I miss something?
s01_e13_c02_u026	No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
s01_e13_c02_u027	You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
s01_e13_c02_u028	It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
s01_e13_c02_u029	Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
s01_e13_c02_u030	Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
s01_e13_c02_u031	Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
s01_e13_c02_u032	Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
s01_e13_c02_u033	Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
s01_e13_c02_u034	Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.
s01_e13_c02_u035	You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
s01_e13_c02_u036	Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
s01_e13_c02_u037	Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
s01_e13_c02_u038	Huh.
s01_e13_c02_u039	I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
s01_e13_c02_u040	Uhhuh, how did you know that?
s01_e13_c02_u041	It's textbook.
s01_e13_c02_u042	Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
s01_e13_c02_u043	Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
s01_e13_c02_u044	Hey, how long are you in the city?
s01_e13_c02_u045	Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) I don't know this one.
s01_e13_c02_u046	Oh, this is my friend Roger.
s01_e13_c02_u047	Hi.
s01_e13_c02_u048	Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
s01_e13_c02_u049	You too, sir.
s01_e13_c02_u050	(To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
s01_e13_c02_u051	Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)
s01_e13_c02_u052	Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross whines and lays his head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
s01_e13_c03_u053	Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
s01_e13_c03_u054	(Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?
s01_e13_c03_u055	Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
s01_e13_c03_u056	Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)
s01_e13_c03_u057	Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
s01_e13_c03_u058	Since then?!
s01_e13_c03_u059	No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
s01_e13_c03_u060	...I d'know.
s01_e13_c03_u061	Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
s01_e13_c03_u062	You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)
s01_e13_c03_u063	Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
s01_e13_c03_u064	Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
s01_e13_c03_u065	Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
s01_e13_c04_u066	It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!
s01_e13_c04_u067	I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
s01_e13_c04_u068	(Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
s01_e13_c04_u069	Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
s01_e13_c04_u070	Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
s01_e13_c04_u071	Y'know, I don't see that happening?
s01_e13_c04_u072	C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
s01_e13_c04_u073	Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
s01_e13_c04_u074	Hello?
s01_e13_c04_u075	(Intercom) It's Phoebe.
s01_e13_c04_u076	(Intercom) And Rog.
s01_e13_c04_u077	C'mon up.
s01_e13_c04_u078	(Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.
s01_e13_c04_u079	What's the matter with Rog?
s01_e13_c04_u080	Yeah.
s01_e13_c04_u081	Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
s01_e13_c04_u082	What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
s01_e13_c04_u083	Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
s01_e13_c04_u084	I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
s01_e13_c04_u085	Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
s01_e13_c04_u086	I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
s01_e13_c04_u087	Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
s01_e13_c04_u088	Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
s01_e13_c04_u089	That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
s01_e13_c04_u090	Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
s01_e13_c04_u091	Isn't he good?
s01_e13_c04_u092	Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
s01_e13_c04_u093	Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
s01_e13_c04_u094	Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
s01_e13_c04_u095	You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
s01_e13_c04_u096	That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
s01_e13_c04_u097	Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
s01_e13_c04_u098	Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
s01_e13_c04_u099	Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
s01_e13_c04_u100	You're welcome.
s01_e13_c04_u101	Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
s01_e13_c04_u102	Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
s01_e13_c05_u103	Night, you guys.
s01_e13_c05_u104	Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
s01_e13_c05_u105	Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
s01_e13_c05_u106	Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
s01_e13_c05_u107	I'm Joey Tribbiani.
s01_e13_c05_u108	Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
s01_e13_c05_u109	Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
s01_e13_c06_u110	Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
s01_e13_c06_u111	Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
s01_e13_c06_u112	That's a good one!
s01_e13_c06_u113	Hey, Joe.
s01_e13_c06_u114	Dad, Ronni's here.
s01_e13_c06_u115	Huh?
s01_e13_c06_u116	Hi.
s01_e13_c06_u117	Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
s01_e13_c06_u118	Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)
s01_e13_c06_u119	Thank you. Uh...
s01_e13_c06_u120	So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
s01_e13_c06_u121	Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
s01_e13_c06_u122	I don't want you taking that thing.
s01_e13_c06_u123	Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
s01_e13_c06_u124	Who-ah-ho.
s01_e13_c06_u125	We'll go to a hotel.
s01_e13_c06_u126	(Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel.
s01_e13_c06_u127	No you won't.
s01_e13_c06_u128	No we won't.
s01_e13_c06_u129	If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
s01_e13_c06_u130	You're gonna keep an eye on us?
s01_e13_c06_u131	That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
s01_e13_c06_u132	Wow. He's strict.
s01_e13_c06_u133	Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
s01_e13_c06_u134	Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
s01_e13_c06_u135	C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
s01_e13_c06_u136	Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
s01_e13_c06_u137	What kinda change?
s01_e13_c06_u138	Well, either you break it off with Ronni
s01_e13_c06_u139	I can't do that!
s01_e13_c06_u140	Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
s01_e13_c06_u141	Yeah, but this is
s01_e13_c06_u142	I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
s01_e13_c07_u143	Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
s01_e13_c07_u144	Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
s01_e13_c07_u145	Well, you're gonna.
s01_e13_c07_u146	I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
s01_e13_c07_u147	Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
s01_e13_c07_u148	Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
s01_e13_c07_u149	Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
s01_e13_c07_u150	No.
s01_e13_c07_u151	No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
s01_e13_c07_u152	You really think so?
s01_e13_c07_u153	Yeah. I really do.
s01_e13_c07_u154	Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)
s01_e13_c07_u155	Get off!
s01_e13_c08_u156	Hi.
s01_e13_c08_u157	Hi...May I help you?
s01_e13_c08_u158	Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
s01_e13_c08_u159	Okay...who are you?
s01_e13_c08_u160	Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
s01_e13_c08_u161	Oh, c'mon in.
s01_e13_c08_u162	Thanks.
s01_e13_c08_u163	Hi, I'm Rachel.
s01_e13_c08_u164	Hi.
s01_e13_c08_u165	Bathroom's up there.
s01_e13_c08_u166	Great.
s01_e13_c08_u167	Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
s01_e13_c08_u168	Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
s01_e13_c08_u169	Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib.
s01_e13_c08_u170	Hey. Morning, dear.
s01_e13_c08_u171	Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
s01_e13_c08_u172	(Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!
s01_e13_c08_u173	I thought it was Chandler!
s01_e13_c08_u174	(Comes out of his room) What? What?
s01_e13_c08_u175	You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
s01_e13_c08_u176	Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
s01_e13_c09_u177	Hey, Pheebs.
s01_e13_c09_u178	Hey.
s01_e13_c09_u179	How's it going?
s01_e13_c09_u180	Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
s01_e13_c09_u181	So what's going on?
s01_e13_c09_u182	Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
s01_e13_c09_u183	I dunno, there's just something about...
s01_e13_c09_u184	Basically we just feel that he's...
s01_e13_c09_u185	We hate that guy.
s01_e13_c09_u186	Yeah. Hate him.
s01_e13_c09_u187	We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
s01_e13_c09_u188	Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
s01_e13_c09_u189	...No, we hate him.
s01_e13_c09_u190	We're sorry.
s01_e13_c10_u191	Ma! What're you doing here?
s01_e13_c10_u192	I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this. (Whacks him round the ear)
s01_e13_c10_u193	Oww! Big ring!
s01_e13_c10_u194	Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and it folds away)
s01_e13_c10_u195	Hold on, you-you knew?
s01_e13_c10_u196	Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
s01_e13_c10_u197	So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
s01_e13_c10_u198	Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
s01_e13_c10_u199	Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
s01_e13_c10_u200	Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
s01_e13_c10_u201	I'm...happy...for you?
s01_e13_c10_u202	Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
s01_e13_c10_u203	Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
s01_e13_c10_u204	I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
s01_e13_c10_u205	Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
s01_e13_c10_u206	That's sweet. Could I take her?
s01_e13_c10_u207	With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.
s01_e13_c11_u208	What's wrong, sweetie?
s01_e13_c11_u209	Nothing, nothing.
s01_e13_c11_u210	Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her head in his lap)
s01_e13_c11_u211	It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
s01_e13_c11_u212	Oh. They don't.
s01_e13_c11_u213	But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
s01_e13_c11_u214	What?
s01_e13_c11_u215	Intense and creepy.
s01_e13_c11_u216	Oh.
s01_e13_c11_u217	But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
s01_e13_c11_u218	Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
s01_e13_c11_u219	You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
s01_e13_c11_u220	Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
s01_e13_c12_u221	So you talked to your dad, huh.
s01_e13_c12_u222	Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
s01_e13_c12_u223	Wow.
s01_e13_c12_u224	Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
s01_e13_c12_u225	So Joey, you okay?
s01_e13_c12_u226	Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
s01_e13_c12_u227	Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
s01_e13_c12_u228	If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
s01_e13_c12_u229	(entering) Hey.
s01_e13_c12_u230	Hey, Pheebs.
s01_e13_c12_u231	How's it going?
s01_e13_c12_u232	Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
s01_e13_c12_u233	Awww.
s01_e13_c12_u234	Yeah, right.
s01_e13_c12_u235	Aaawwwwww!!
s01_e13_c12_u236	What happened?
s01_e13_c12_u237	I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
s01_e13_c13_u238	Hey, Joey. What's going on?
s01_e13_c13_u239	Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel)
s01_e13_c13_u240	Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
s01_e13_c13_u241	Sorry. Wrong boobies.
s01_e13_c13_u242	Hello, Joey.
s01_e13_c13_u243	Oh! ...Hello, dear. (She whips the curtain shut in horror)
s07_e20_c01_u001	Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
s07_e20_c01_u002	Probably Monica and Chandler.
s07_e20_c01_u003	Oh umm, uh we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street. (Points.)
s07_e20_c01_u004	(to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this.
s07_e20_c01_u005	(Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)
s07_e20_c01_u006	(screaming) Melissa!
s07_e20_c01_u007	You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what's up with you?!
s07_e20_c01_u008	Wh-(Turns and looks at the gang who's staring)-Why don't I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)
s07_e20_c01_u009	So last I heard you were gonna get married. (Grabs Rachel's hand and notices that she doesn't have a ring on it.) (Sadly) Oh poor Ray-ray.
s07_e20_c01_u010	Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
s07_e20_c01_u011	Shut up!
s07_e20_c01_u012	I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
s07_e20_c01_u013	Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
s07_e20_c01_u014	Oh please
s07_e20_c01_u015	(excitedly) Are you?!
s07_e20_c01_u016	No.
s07_e20_c01_u017	Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
s07_e20_c01_u018	Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um
s07_e20_c01_u019	You do now. You're having dinner with me.
s07_e20_c01_u020	Shut up.
s07_e20_c01_u021	I-I've got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! (Gunther returns with her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so listen, just call me. Here's my card. (Hands the card over.)
s07_e20_c01_u022	Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you're in real estate!
s07_e20_c01_u023	Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
s07_e20_c01_u024	Wow! What do you do now?
s07_e20_c01_u025	(quietly) I'm a party planner. I'll see you tomorrow. (Exits.)
s07_e20_c01_u026	Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)
s07_e20_c01_u027	Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
s07_e20_c01_u028	Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
s07_e20_c01_u029	She seems really, really fun!
s07_e20_c01_u030	She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
s07_e20_c01_u031	Wait a minute, she isn't- She's not the one who you
s07_e20_c01_u032	(excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!
s07_e20_c01_u033	(To Monica) Yes.
s07_e20_c01_u034	Wow!
s07_e20_c01_u035	(excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
s07_e20_c01_u036	It's not a big deal!
s07_e20_c01_u037	(To Joey) They were lovers.
s07_e20_c01_u038	What?!
s07_e20_c01_u039	What?!
s07_e20_c01_u040	No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up-kissing for a bit.
s07_e20_c01_u041	So that's two of my wives.
s07_e20_c02_u042	(telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have people's names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel's place.)
s07_e20_c02_u043	Oh wow. Why don't we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren't for playing are they?
s07_e20_c02_u044	(To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
s07_e20_c02_u045	This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
s07_e20_c02_u046	Chandler, relax it's not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a close one.
s07_e20_c02_u047	(entering) Hello!
s07_e20_c02_u048	Hey!
s07_e20_c02_u049	Hey Rach. (Stares at her.)
s07_e20_c02_u050	Stop picturing it!!
s07_e20_c02_u051	Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?
s07_e20_c02_u052	Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
s07_e20_c02_u053	Oh! (Gets up) Let's see, well-if this is the wedding hall then umm (Walks away) you're parents will be at home in Queens.
s07_e20_c02_u054	What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!
s07_e20_c02_u055	Why would they think they're invited?
s07_e20_c02_u056	(looking around) You got me. I don't
s07_e20_c02_u057	Joey!
s07_e20_c02_u058	Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!
s07_e20_c02_u059	Ross's parents are my parents!
s07_e20_c02_u060	Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
s07_e20_c02_u061	Y'know I think we should invite them.
s07_e20_c02_u062	Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
s07_e20_c02_u063	Well this is just sad!
s07_e20_c02_u064	All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
s07_e20_c02_u065	That is not a problem.
s07_e20_c02_u066	(leaning down to her) Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
s07_e20_c02_u067	Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)
s07_e20_c03_u068	(motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
s07_e20_c03_u069	Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
s07_e20_c03_u070	I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
s07_e20_c03_u071	(sees another rack) Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice.
s07_e20_c03_u072	Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send em back.
s07_e20_c03_u073	You mean like for award shows?
s07_e20_c03_u074	Some of them.
s07_e20_c03_u075	You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
s07_e20_c03_u076	Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
s07_e20_c03_u077	Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)
s07_e20_c03_u078	Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.
s07_e20_c03_u079	Not bad.
s07_e20_c03_u080	(reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
s07_e20_c03_u081	Who's that?
s07_e20_c03_u082	He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
s07_e20_c03_u083	Pierce Brosnan?
s07_e20_c03_u084	Uh-huh.
s07_e20_c03_u085	Are you serious?
s07_e20_c03_u086	Yeah.
s07_e20_c03_u087	007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
s07_e20_c03_u088	Yeah.
s07_e20_c03_u089	Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!
s07_e20_c03_u090	It's a pretty cool tux.
s07_e20_c03_u091	Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?
s07_e20_c04_u092	We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)
s07_e20_c04_u093	I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey's like in Checkers.) Chess!
s07_e20_c04_u094	Nice move.
s07_e20_c04_u095	Yeah.
s07_e20_c04_u096	(entering) Hey!
s07_e20_c04_u097	Hey!
s07_e20_c04_u098	Hey!
s07_e20_c04_u099	So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
s07_e20_c04_u100	No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
s07_e20_c04_u101	Well, what are you going to wear?
s07_e20_c04_u102	Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
s07_e20_c04_u103	Huh. Does Monica know about this?
s07_e20_c04_u104	I don't think so.
s07_e20_c04_u105	Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)
s07_e20_c04_u106	Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
s07_e20_c04_u107	Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
s07_e20_c04_u108	(excitedly) Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
s07_e20_c04_u109	What is this? What's going on?
s07_e20_c04_u110	Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
s07_e20_c04_u111	Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
s07_e20_c04_u112	Joey's!
s07_e20_c04_u113	Okay
s07_e20_c04_u114	Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time-she and I y'know-kissed a little bit.
s07_e20_c04_u115	(laughs) Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
s07_e20_c04_u116	It-it did!
s07_e20_c04_u117	Sure!
s07_e20_c04_u118	Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!
s07_e20_c04_u119	Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
s07_e20_c04_u120	(To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
s07_e20_c04_u121	Why are you taking this away from me?
s07_e20_c04_u122	Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
s07_e20_c04_u123	Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian. (Joey smiles and nods lewdly.)
s07_e20_c04_u124	I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
s07_e20_c04_u125	Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so-vanilla.
s07_e20_c04_u126	(shocked) Vanilla?!
s07_e20_c04_u127	Yeah.
s07_e20_c04_u128	I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
s07_e20_c04_u129	To Ross.
s07_e20_c04_u130	All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
s07_e20_c04_u131	Okay! All right! Yeah! Cause I just can't picture it.
s07_e20_c04_u132	Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
s07_e20_c05_u133	Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)
s07_e20_c05_u134	A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
s07_e20_c05_u135	No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!
s07_e20_c05_u136	What?
s07_e20_c05_u137	That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film-that Batman film he was in.
s07_e20_c05_u138	You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
s07_e20_c05_u139	So?
s07_e20_c05_u140	So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
s07_e20_c05_u141	Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
s07_e20_c05_u142	Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
s07_e20_c05_u143	Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
s07_e20_c05_u144	Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
s07_e20_c05_u145	When I got married you slept with my sister.
s07_e20_c05_u146	That was pretty 007.
s07_e20_c06_u147	Hey.
s07_e20_c06_u148	Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
s07_e20_c06_u149	Yeah, they're not coming.
s07_e20_c06_u150	(looking at him) What?!
s07_e20_c06_u151	Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They-feel a little unwanted.
s07_e20_c06_u152	Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.
s07_e20_c06_u153	Look Mon, if you could just call my mom
s07_e20_c06_u154	Oh Joey!
s07_e20_c06_u155	Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
s07_e20_c06_u156	No she hasn't.
s07_e20_c06_u157	Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
s07_e20_c06_u158	Well, what am I going to say?
s07_e20_c06_u159	I don't know. Just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so- (He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)
s07_e20_c06_u160	(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives her a thumbs up.)
s07_e20_c07_u161	anyway, his name is Allan and we've been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
s07_e20_c07_u162	Oh. Oh, that's great!
s07_e20_c07_u163	Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
s07_e20_c07_u164	Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
s07_e20_c07_u165	What one?
s07_e20_c07_u166	Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
s07_e20_c07_u167	Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? (Phoebe agrees by grunting.)
s07_e20_c07_u168	(changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
s07_e20_c07_u169	(shocked) What?
s07_e20_c07_u170	Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops
s07_e20_c07_u171	Yeah?
s07_e20_c07_u172	we went back the house and we got really silly and we-we made out.
s07_e20_c07_u173	Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you're talking about.
s07_e20_c07_u174	Really?!
s07_e20_c08_u175	Ross is Batman!
s07_e20_c08_u176	Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
s07_e20_c08_u177	Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
s07_e20_c08_u178	What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
s07_e20_c08_u179	Batman has a utility belt!
s07_e20_c08_u180	007 has a fancy car!
s07_e20_c08_u181	Batman has the Batmobile!
s07_e20_c08_u182	007 gets all the ladies.
s07_e20_c08_u183	Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
s07_e20_c08_u184	How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
s07_e20_c08_u185	Actually, I don't like martinis.
s07_e20_c08_u186	How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
s07_e20_c08_u187	Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)
s07_e20_c08_u188	(entering) Hey.
s07_e20_c08_u189	Hey.
s07_e20_c08_u190	Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
s07_e20_c08_u191	The show?!
s07_e20_c08_u192	Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
s07_e20_c08_u193	Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
s07_e20_c08_u194	Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!
s07_e20_c08_u195	The wedding starts at six.
s07_e20_c08_u196	Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little til they get there?
s07_e20_c08_u197	You'll vamp?!
s07_e20_c08_u198	Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask em where they're from. Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one greater!
s07_e20_c09_u199	How can you not remember us kissing?!
s07_e20_c09_u200	I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
s07_e20_c09_u201	Wh- Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
s07_e20_c09_u202	Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
s07_e20_c09_u203	Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me.
s07_e20_c09_u204	I'm sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
s07_e20_c09_u205	No!!
s07_e20_c09_u206	Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
s07_e20_c09_u207	Thank you Phoebe.
s07_e20_c09_u208	She didn't.
s07_e20_c09_u209	I know.
s07_e20_c10_u210	Hey!
s07_e20_c10_u211	You just carry that around?
s07_e20_c10_u212	Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
s07_e20_c10_u213	Between you and
s07_e20_c10_u214	Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
s07_e20_c10_u215	I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
s07_e20_c10_u216	A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
s07_e20_c10_u217	Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
s07_e20_c10_u218	Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?
s07_e20_c10_u219	What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
s07_e20_c10_u220	(standing up) Let me try it on!
s07_e20_c10_u221	Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
s07_e20_c10_u222	(trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) What's this?
s07_e20_c10_u223	What?
s07_e20_c10_u224	An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
s07_e20_c10_u225	Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!
s07_e20_c10_u226	The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
s07_e20_c10_u227	(entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
s07_e20_c10_u228	All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!
s07_e20_c10_u229	No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
s07_e20_c10_u230	(defeated) Oh.
s07_e20_c10_u231	Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
s07_e20_c10_u232	Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.
s07_e20_c11_u233	It happened! I am telling you it happened!
s07_e20_c11_u234	Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don't think I'll be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, y'know you've gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys.
s07_e20_c11_u235	What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)
s07_e20_c11_u236	My God! You love me!
s07_e20_c11_u237	(shocked) What?
s07_e20_c11_u238	Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin' together I- (Phoebe is shocked.) I just didn't want to tell you cause I didn't think that you'd return my love, and now that you have- (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)
s07_e20_c11_u239	(moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
s07_e20_c11_u240	Aww, look who's being suddenly shy. You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.)
s07_e20_c11_u241	(moves away again) I-I-I-I'm just-I'm just a good kisser!
s07_e20_c11_u242	(suddenly frightened) Shut up!
s07_e20_c11_u243	I'm sorry!
s07_e20_c11_u244	(laughs) Oh you don't have to be (Laughs again) sorry. I'm-I'm obviously kidding. I'm not in love with you. (To Phoebe) I'm not in love with her. I don't hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don't-picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh-kiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and drives off.)
s07_e20_c11_u245	Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna
s07_e20_c11_u246	What the hell was that?!
s07_e20_c11_u247	I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
s07_e20_c11_u248	And?
s07_e20_c11_u249	I've had better.
s07_e20_c12_u250	(yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
s07_e20_c12_u251	Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!
s07_e20_c12_u252	Whose is it?
s07_e20_c12_u253	Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
s07_e20_c12_u254	Whose is it?
s07_e20_c12_u255	I don't want to say.
s07_e20_c12_u256	Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?
s07_e20_c12_u257	Diane Keeton.
s03_e09_c01_u001	(reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
s03_e09_c01_u002	Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
s03_e09_c01_u003	We will. (they don't move)
s03_e09_c01_u004	Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
s03_e09_c01_u005	No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
s03_e09_c01_u006	Every year.
s03_e09_c02_u007	Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).
s03_e09_c02_u008	Halftime.
s03_e09_c02_u009	Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
s03_e09_c02_u010	Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
s03_e09_c02_u011	Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.
s03_e09_c02_u012	Great, you can cover Chandler.
s03_e09_c02_u013	No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.
s03_e09_c02_u014	Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
s03_e09_c02_u015	That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
s03_e09_c02_u016	Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you cause the teams won't be even. Come on.
s03_e09_c02_u017	Yeah, all right, I'll play.
s03_e09_c02_u018	Yay!!
s03_e09_c02_u019	Let's do it! Ross?
s03_e09_c02_u020	What?
s03_e09_c02_u021	Do you wanna play football?
s03_e09_c02_u022	Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
s03_e09_c02_u023	Says who? Your mom?
s03_e09_c02_u024	Yeah.
s03_e09_c02_u025	Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the Geller Bowl.'
s03_e09_c02_u026	No, no, no, you say that proudly.
s03_e09_c02_u027	Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.
s03_e09_c02_u028	It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
s03_e09_c02_u029	To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
s03_e09_c02_u030	Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
s03_e09_c02_u031	(to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.
s03_e09_c02_u032	Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
s03_e09_c02_u033	Um, there was a Geller Cup?
s03_e09_c02_u034	Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, nobody won that game, and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.
s03_e09_c02_u035	And was the curse lifted?
s03_e09_c02_u036	Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
s03_e09_c02_u037	Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.
s03_e09_c02_u038	Can I see you for a second?
s03_e09_c02_u039	(shouting) Once!!
s03_e09_c02_u040	All right, we're gonna play.
s03_e09_c02_u041	But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street.
s03_e09_c03_u042	Okay. Let's bring it in.
s03_e09_c03_u043	Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
s03_e09_c03_u044	Here you go. (throws her the ball)
s03_e09_c03_u045	(knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the face.
s03_e09_c03_u046	All right, we have to pick captains.
s03_e09_c03_u047	And then Tineals.
s03_e09_c03_u048	Okay, so how do we decide that?
s03_e09_c03_u049	Well, why don't we just bunny up.
s03_e09_c03_u050	What?
s03_e09_c03_u051	(holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!
s03_e09_c03_u052	Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
s03_e09_c03_u053	Thank you.
s03_e09_c03_u054	Monica, I'm your best friend.
s03_e09_c03_u055	Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler.
s03_e09_c03_u056	Ross!
s03_e09_c03_u057	Phoebe.
s03_e09_c03_u058	Sweetie, now I pick you.
s03_e09_c03_u059	You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
s03_e09_c03_u060	Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off.
s03_e09_c03_u061	All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.
s03_e09_c03_u062	Wow! Just like in the pros.
s03_e09_c03_u063	Huddle up.
s03_e09_c03_u064	(to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.
s03_e09_c03_u065	Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.
s03_e09_c03_u066	Okay.
s03_e09_c03_u067	Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?
s03_e09_c03_u068	Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?
s03_e09_c03_u069	Yeah.
s03_e09_c03_u070	Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.
s03_e09_c03_u071	What's block?
s03_e09_c03_u072	Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?
s03_e09_c03_u073	I thought you meant in life.
s03_e09_c03_u074	Break.
s03_e09_c03_u075	The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks Ross's foot instead.)
s03_e09_c03_u076	Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
s03_e09_c03_u077	Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it.
s03_e09_c03_u078	I got it. (catches the ball)
s03_e09_c03_u079	Go! Go! Go!
s03_e09_c03_u080	Score!! 7 to nothing!
s03_e09_c03_u081	(coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?
s03_e09_c03_u082	Come on, let's go!
s03_e09_c03_u083	Losers walk!
s03_e09_c03_u084	Yeah, losers talk!
s03_e09_c03_u085	No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
s03_e09_c03_u086	(coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between Ross's legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?
s03_e09_c03_u087	Yeah!
s03_e09_c03_u088	(from the shotgun) Hike!
s03_e09_c03_u089	One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
s03_e09_c03_u090	Over here!
s03_e09_c03_u091	(proud of her self) I almost caught that one!
s03_e09_c03_u092	Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
s03_e09_c03_u093	Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!
s03_e09_c03_u094	Wait, what am I gonna do?
s03_e09_c03_u095	You, you go long.
s03_e09_c03_u096	Wait, how long?
s03_e09_c03_u097	Until we start to look very small.
s03_e09_c03_u098	Okay.

s03_e09_c03_u124	Okay, it's second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you need.
s03_e09_c03_u125	I heard that!
s03_e09_c03_u126	Well, I said it loud.
s03_e09_c03_u127	It is okay, if I stay and watch?
s03_e09_c03_u128	Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
s03_e09_c03_u129	Well, that went well.
s03_e09_c03_u130	I think so.
s03_e09_c03_u131	Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
s03_e09_c03_u132	Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
s03_e09_c03_u133	Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
s03_e09_c03_u134	Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her.
s03_e09_c03_u135	Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?
s03_e09_c03_u136	Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
s03_e09_c03_u137	Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her.
s03_e09_c03_u138	Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
s03_e09_c03_u139	Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
s03_e09_c03_u140	Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
s03_e09_c03_u141	Can I see that for second.
s03_e09_c03_u142	Yeah.
s03_e09_c03_u143	Okay. Hut! Hike!
s03_e09_c03_u144	Fumble!
s03_e09_c03_u145	What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
s03_e09_c03_u146	Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.
s03_e09_c03_u147	All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
s03_e09_c03_u148	Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!
s03_e09_c03_u149	All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica throws the ball to Phoebe.)
s03_e09_c03_u150	Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!
s03_e09_c03_u151	Pheebs, run!
s03_e09_c03_u152	Run, Phoebe, run!
s03_e09_c03_u153	Touchdown!! Touchdown!!
s03_e09_c03_u154	Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
s03_e09_c03_u155	After the snap!
s03_e09_c03_u156	Before the snap!
s03_e09_c03_u157	After!!
s03_e09_c03_u158	Before!!
s03_e09_c03_u159	Now, does it really matter?
s03_e09_c03_u160	Yes!!
s03_e09_c03_u161	Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
s03_e09_c03_u162	Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count.
s03_e09_c03_u163	Does so count!
s03_e09_c03_u164	Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
s03_e09_c03_u165	Oh my God!
s03_e09_c03_u166	Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
s03_e09_c03_u167	Oh-ho, okay.
s03_e09_c03_u168	Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)
s03_e09_c03_u169	Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
s03_e09_c03_u170	Woo-yay!!
s03_e09_c03_u171	No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.
s03_e09_c03_u172	Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!
s03_e09_c03_u173	Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
s03_e09_c03_u174	Oh really! Why is that?
s03_e09_c03_u175	Because the winner gets this!
s03_e09_c03_u176	The Geller Cup.
s03_e09_c03_u177	Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
s03_e09_c03_u178	Yeah.
s03_e09_c03_u179	Okay, good.
s03_e09_c04_u180	Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
s03_e09_c04_u181	When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
s03_e09_c04_u182	That cup is mine!
s03_e09_c04_u183	No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!
s03_e09_c04_u184	All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
s03_e09_c04_u185	Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.
s03_e09_c04_u186	It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
s03_e09_c04_u187	All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
s03_e09_c04_u188	What are you gonna do?
s03_e09_c04_u189	All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.
s03_e09_c04_u190	Okay.
s03_e09_c04_u191	Break!
s03_e09_c04_u192	Here you go!
s03_e09_c04_u193	Chandler! Chandler!
s03_e09_c04_u194	(to Margha) Hi.
s03_e09_c04_u195	Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?
s03_e09_c04_u196	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
s03_e09_c04_u197	What?! I just touched him and he went over.
s03_e09_c04_u198	Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
s03_e09_c04_u199	I love this game!!
s03_e09_c04_u200	Hey, where'd you get that?
s03_e09_c04_u201	I went really long.
s03_e09_c04_u202	Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
s03_e09_c04_u203	It's no surprise that your winning, cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
s03_e09_c04_u204	You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you.
s03_e09_c04_u205	Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.
s03_e09_c04_u206	What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
s03_e09_c04_u207	Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
s03_e09_c04_u208	Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me.
s03_e09_c04_u209	I can not believe your trading me!!
s03_e09_c04_u210	Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change.
s03_e09_c04_u211	Are you gonna let me play?
s03_e09_c04_u212	All right then.
s03_e09_c04_u213	(coming over) The game is over, we eat now?
s03_e09_c04_u214	No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.
s03_e09_c04_u215	Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team.
s03_e09_c04_u216	Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.
s03_e09_c04_u217	No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
s03_e09_c04_u218	Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
s03_e09_c04_u219	And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
s03_e09_c04_u220	Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
s03_e09_c04_u221	Oh, my.
s03_e09_c04_u222	Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.
s03_e09_c04_u223	Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now.
s03_e09_c04_u224	Fine with me.
s03_e09_c04_u225	Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
s03_e09_c04_u226	What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
s03_e09_c04_u227	Which do I like?
s03_e09_c04_u228	Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
s03_e09_c04_u229	Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
s03_e09_c04_u230	Yes!!
s03_e09_c04_u231	Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
s03_e09_c04_u232	Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
s03_e09_c04_u233	I'm sorry, Joey, that is my chose.
s03_e09_c04_u234	You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)
s03_e09_c04_u235	I'm now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.
s03_e09_c04_u236	Wh-what?
s03_e09_c04_u237	I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
s03_e09_c04_u238	Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
s03_e09_c04_u239	Y'know what, it doesn't matter, cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
s03_e09_c04_u240	Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
s03_e09_c04_u241	We're not gonna lose to girls.
s03_e09_c04_u242	Hey! It's 42-21!
s03_e09_c04_u243	This sucks, I was just up by that much!
s03_e09_c04_u244	Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
s03_e09_c04_u245	We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out...
s03_e09_c04_u246	Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
s03_e09_c04_u247	Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill um!
s03_e09_c04_u248	Yeah!!! Kill um!!!
s03_e09_c04_u249	All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
s03_e09_c04_u250	All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.
s03_e09_c04_u251	No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
s03_e09_c04_u252	Honey, there's a reason.
s03_e09_c04_u253	God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
s03_e09_c04_u254	Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
s03_e09_c04_u255	All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.
s03_e09_c04_u256	Thank you! Break!
s03_e09_c04_u257	Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
s03_e09_c04_u258	One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
s03_e09_c04_u259	I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
s03_e09_c04_u260	No! I'm not okay!
s03_e09_c04_u261	I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.
s03_e09_c04_u262	(looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!
s03_e09_c04_u263	Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
s03_e09_c04_u264	Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
s03_e09_c04_u265	Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
s03_e09_c04_u266	All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.
s03_e09_c04_u267	(on the verge of tears) Okay.
s03_e09_c04_u268	Break!
s03_e09_c04_u269	(in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!
s03_e09_c04_u270	Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!
s03_e09_c04_u271	Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going.
s03_e09_c04_u272	Let go! Let go!
s03_e09_c04_u273	Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
s03_e09_c04_u274	Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
s03_e09_c04_u275	Ow!!
s03_e09_c05_u276	We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
s03_e09_c05_u277	Isn't there a national football league.
s03_e09_c05_u278	Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
s03_e09_c05_u279	Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
s03_e09_c05_u280	Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
s03_e09_c05_u281	When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.
s03_e09_c06_u282	Let go!
s03_e09_c06_u283	No! You let go!
s03_e09_c06_u284	No!
s03_e09_c06_u285	How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
s03_e09_c06_u286	I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
s03_e09_c06_u287	Hey! It's starting to snow.
s03_e09_c06_u288	Gimme the this!
s03_e09_c06_u289	Let go!
s09_e01_c01_u001	Joey.
s09_e01_c01_u002	(seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
s09_e01_c01_u003	So uh-I guess we should-make it official huh?
s09_e01_c01_u004	Uh- Look Rach-(Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
s09_e01_c01_u005	Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.
s09_e01_c01_u006	Hey you.
s09_e01_c01_u007	Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy. (Laughs.)
s09_e01_c01_u008	You're weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.) (To Rachel) Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
s09_e01_c01_u009	Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
s09_e01_c01_u010	Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
s09_e01_c01_u011	No.
s09_e01_c01_u012	What?
s09_e01_c01_u013	Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.
s09_e01_c01_u014	(entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look who's here!
s09_e01_c01_u015	Where's my granddaughter? I've been practicing my magic tricks.
s09_e01_c01_u016	He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
s09_e01_c01_u017	Hey, where's uh, where's mom?
s09_e01_c01_u018	She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
s09_e01_c01_u019	Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!
s09_e01_c01_u020	So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? (Pulls a bouquet of flowers out of his sleeve.)
s09_e01_c01_u021	Okay. Wow.
s09_e01_c01_u022	Uh Dad, Emma's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.
s09_e01_c01_u023	I know, I still need to talk to you.
s09_e01_c01_u024	Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
s09_e01_c01_u025	(To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.
s09_e01_c01_u026	About what?
s09_e01_c01_u027	To see if know what these guys are talking about.
s09_e01_c02_u028	Isn't she beautiful?
s09_e01_c02_u029	Look at her, my first grandchild.
s09_e01_c02_u030	What about Ben?
s09_e01_c02_u031	Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. (To Monica, mouths) Wow.
s09_e01_c02_u032	(taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
s09_e01_c02_u033	Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
s09_e01_c02_u034	Yay! It's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there.
s09_e01_c02_u035	Yeah right.
s09_e01_c02_u036	Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.
s09_e01_c02_u037	What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
s09_e01_c02_u038	Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
s09_e01_c02_u039	(taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
s09_e01_c02_u040	Sure.
s09_e01_c02_u041	Dude I just did something terrible.
s09_e01_c02_u042	That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
s09_e01_c02_u043	No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
s09_e01_c02_u044	What?! Why does she think that?
s09_e01_c02_u045	Because it kinda looked like I did.
s09_e01_c02_u046	Again, what?!
s09_e01_c02_u047	Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand
s09_e01_c02_u048	As we all are at some point during the day.
s09_e01_c02_u049	It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
s09_e01_c02_u050	Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
s09_e01_c02_u051	I guess.
s09_e01_c02_u052	And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
s09_e01_c02_u053	I know! I know it's awful.
s09_e01_c02_u054	Well, what did she say?
s09_e01_c02_u055	(happily) She said yes.
s09_e01_c02_u056	Does Ross know?
s09_e01_c02_u057	Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
s09_e01_c02_u058	Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
s09_e01_c02_u059	Oh, I like that. Yeah
s09_e01_c02_u060	If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
s09_e01_c02_u061	(laughs) Now let's not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)
s09_e01_c02_u062	I want a baby.
s09_e01_c02_u063	Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
s09_e01_c02_u064	Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?
s09_e01_c02_u065	I'm so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
s09_e01_c02_u066	Deal!
s09_e01_c02_u067	Dad seriously! Y'know you really should see someone about that!
s09_e01_c02_u068	Noted.
s09_e01_c02_u069	I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
s09_e01_c02_u070	Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
s09_e01_c02_u071	(noticing something) Actually umm- (He turns Mr. Geller's head to look at Emma.)
s09_e01_c03_u072	Hey!
s09_e01_c03_u073	Hi.
s09_e01_c03_u074	Are you all right?
s09_e01_c03_u075	Uhh- I think I just got engaged.
s09_e01_c03_u076	Oh my God! He did it?
s09_e01_c03_u077	Well-did you know he was gonna ask me?
s09_e01_c03_u078	Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
s09_e01_c03_u079	And you really think this is a good idea?
s09_e01_c03_u080	I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
s09_e01_c03_u081	I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
s09_e01_c03_u082	Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
s09_e01_c03_u083	Really?! Even Ross?
s09_e01_c03_u084	Especially Ross!
s09_e01_c03_u085	(entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who's entering.)
s09_e01_c03_u086	Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just-I'll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)
s09_e01_c03_u087	There he goes, your fiancee.
s09_e01_c03_u088	I guess so.
s09_e01_c03_u089	Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
s09_e01_c03_u090	I can't say that I'm surprised.
s09_e01_c04_u091	Dad, what are you doing?
s09_e01_c04_u092	I think there are people in there having sex.
s09_e01_c04_u093	It can't be me, I'm standing right here.
s09_e01_c04_u094	Wanna peek?
s09_e01_c04_u095	No!
s09_e01_c04_u096	Come on!
s09_e01_c04_u097	Y'know what? I don't like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)
s09_e01_c04_u098	(To Ross) We're not peeking? (Follows him.)
s09_e01_c04_u099	Well I'm peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!
s09_e01_c04_u100	Hello sir, you know Monica.
s09_e01_c05_u101	Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
s09_e01_c05_u102	Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I-it's beautiful I love it!
s09_e01_c05_u103	Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.
s09_e01_c05_u104	Hey!
s09_e01_c05_u105	Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
s09_e01_c05_u106	Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?
s09_e01_c05_u107	It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don't worry. It'll happen.
s09_e01_c05_u108	(watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)
s09_e01_c05_u109	Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
s09_e01_c05_u110	Dear Lord.
s09_e01_c05_u111	I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?
s09_e01_c05_u112	Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that
s09_e01_c05_u113	Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?
s09_e01_c05_u114	Y'know, I don't really know her.
s09_e01_c05_u115	Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does so.)
s09_e01_c05_u116	(To God) Are you kidding me?!
s09_e01_c05_u117	It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
s09_e01_c05_u118	I don't know! Maybe she's crazy! (Storms out.)
s09_e01_c06_u119	Oh hey! Wait up!
s09_e01_c06_u120	Hi!
s09_e01_c06_u121	Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey cause I didn't know if he knew yet.
s09_e01_c06_u122	What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
s09_e01_c06_u123	No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
s09_e01_c06_u124	What?
s09_e01_c06_u125	Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
s09_e01_c06_u126	Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.
s09_e01_c06_u127	Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
s09_e01_c06_u128	(pause) I am a doctor! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
s09_e01_c06_u129	All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she's sleeping.) Should we wake her up?
s09_e01_c06_u130	No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted.
s09_e01_c06_u131	And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)
s09_e01_c06_u132	What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
s09_e01_c06_u133	Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
s09_e01_c06_u134	I didn't give her that ring!
s09_e01_c06_u135	Really?
s09_e01_c06_u136	No!
s09_e01_c06_u137	So whose ring is it?
s09_e01_c06_u138	It's mine.
s09_e01_c06_u139	Is it an engagement ring?
s09_e01_c06_u140	Yes!
s09_e01_c06_u141	But you didn't give it to her?
s09_e01_c06_u142	No!
s09_e01_c06_u143	But you were going to propose?
s09_e01_c06_u144	No!!
s09_e01_c06_u145	Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
s09_e01_c06_u146	Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe-kinda-wanted ah-start-things up again.
s09_e01_c06_u147	Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
s09_e01_c06_u148	Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
s09_e01_c06_u149	No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
s09_e01_c06_u150	Well I didn't! I didn't propose! (Pause) Unless uh- (Pause) Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and-it does sound like something I would do.
s09_e01_c07_u151	Look, we can't stay in here forever.
s09_e01_c07_u152	Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
s09_e01_c07_u153	This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
s09_e01_c07_u154	Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
s09_e01_c07_u155	Of course. I'll always be your dad.
s09_e01_c07_u156	I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
s09_e01_c07_u157	It wasn't fun?!
s09_e01_c07_u158	(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why- (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
s09_e01_c07_u159	Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
s09_e01_c07_u160	The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying.
s09_e01_c07_u161	What?
s09_e01_c07_u162	Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
s09_e01_c07_u163	Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to the closet) I'll guard the door!
s09_e01_c07_u164	Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
s09_e01_c07_u165	Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't think so! Aren't you ovulating?
s09_e01_c07_u166	Daddy?!
s09_e01_c07_u167	Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That's how I got my bad hip.
s09_e01_c07_u168	That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.
s09_e01_c07_u169	This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was
s09_e01_c07_u170	Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
s09_e01_c07_u171	You're right, you're right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.
s09_e01_c07_u172	I don't feel good right now.
s09_e01_c07_u173	But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
s09_e01_c07_u174	Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
s09_e01_c08_u175	Hey.
s09_e01_c08_u176	Hey. I need to tell you something.
s09_e01_c08_u177	Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
s09_e01_c08_u178	Joey asked me marry him.
s09_e01_c08_u179	What?
s09_e01_c08_u180	Joey proposed to me.
s09_e01_c08_u181	Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
s09_e01_c08_u182	Well, I-I said yes.
s09_e01_c08_u183	What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's- It is bigger than mine! (Rachel's engagement ring.)
s09_e01_c08_u184	I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
s09_e01_c08_u185	You can't marry him!
s09_e01_c08_u186	Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
s09_e01_c08_u187	Well do you love him?
s09_e01_c08_u188	Sure.
s09_e01_c08_u189	Sure?
s09_e01_c08_u190	Yeah, I mean whatever.
s09_e01_c08_u191	Honey, the question is-do you really want to marry Joey?
s09_e01_c08_u192	No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
s09_e01_c09_u193	You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
s09_e01_c09_u194	No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
s09_e01_c09_u195	Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!
s09_e01_c09_u196	I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
s09_e01_c09_u197	Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
s09_e01_c09_u198	Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.
s09_e01_c09_u199	Okay, look, just do it gently.
s09_e01_c09_u200	You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.
s09_e01_c10_u201	Hey.
s09_e01_c10_u202	Hey.
s09_e01_c10_u203	Listen, I um- I heard about the engagement.
s09_e01_c10_u204	Surprised?
s09_e01_c10_u205	And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um-I didn't propose to you.
s09_e01_c10_u206	I know.
s09_e01_c10_u207	I don't think you do.
s09_e01_c10_u208	You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
s09_e01_c10_u209	Poor baby, you're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.
s09_e01_c10_u210	Uh- You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.
s09_e01_c10_u211	Joey proposed to you?
s09_e01_c10_u212	I can come back.
s09_e01_c10_u213	Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
s09_e01_c10_u214	No.
s09_e01_c10_u215	Yes you did!
s09_e01_c10_u216	Actually, technically, I didn't.
s09_e01_c10_u217	Well then why did you give me a ring?
s09_e01_c10_u218	Wait! Whoa-whoa, you-you gave her the ring?
s09_e01_c10_u219	No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
s09_e01_c10_u220	Yes, you did!
s09_e01_c10_u221	No, I didn't!
s09_e01_c10_u222	Yes, you did!
s09_e01_c10_u223	No, I didn't!
s09_e01_c10_u224	Yes, you did! And don't you say, "No, I didn't!"
s09_e01_c10_u225	Ahhh!
s09_e01_c10_u226	He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
s09_e01_c10_u227	Whoa! You were down on one knee?
s09_e01_c10_u228	Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't-I didn't propose!
s09_e01_c10_u229	Then what did happen?
s09_e01_c10_u230	Yeah, what did happen?
s09_e01_c10_u231	Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
s09_e01_c10_u232	Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
s09_e01_c10_u233	No, I didn't!
s09_e01_c10_u234	Yes, you did!
s09_e01_c10_u235	No, I didn't!
s09_e01_c10_u236	Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! (Screams) Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!
s09_e01_c10_u237	Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
s09_e01_c10_u238	Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
s09_e01_c10_u239	(To Ross) I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
s09_e01_c10_u240	Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
s09_e01_c10_u241	It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
s09_e01_c10_u242	What?!
s09_e01_c10_u243	You were gonna propose to me?
s09_e01_c10_u244	Uhh- No.
s09_e01_c10_u245	Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
s09_e01_c10_u246	But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.
s09_e01_c10_u247	Dude, step up! I proposed.
s09_e01_c10_u248	No, you didn't!
s09_e01_c10_u249	Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
s09_e01_c10_u250	Hey, she just woke up! She's hungry. Why don't we give this another try?
s09_e01_c10_u251	Okay.
s09_e01_c10_u252	(To Joey) I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!
s09_e01_c10_u253	I can't believe you're not going to propose!
s09_e01_c10_u254	Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!
s09_e01_c10_u255	Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
s09_e01_c10_u256	Oh my God!
s09_e01_c10_u257	What?
s09_e01_c10_u258	She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!
s09_e01_c10_u259	(looking at the ceiling) Ah, it's beautiful.
s09_e01_c10_u260	I'll come back for her later.
s09_e01_c10_u261	Okay.
s09_e01_c10_u262	Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
s09_e01_c10_u263	Oh wow, this feels weird.
s09_e01_c10_u264	Good weird?
s09_e01_c10_u265	Wonderful weird.
s09_e01_c10_u266	Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything.
s09_e01_c10_u267	Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.
s09_e01_c10_u268	No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that-Man! That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)
s09_e01_c10_u269	She's perfect.
s09_e01_c10_u270	We're so lucky.
s09_e01_c10_u271	We really are.
s09_e01_c10_u272	Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and-I've been feeling
s09_e01_c10_u273	I know. I know. I've feeling
s09_e01_c10_u274	Yeah?
s09_e01_c10_u275	Yeah. (Laughs nervously)
s09_e01_c10_u276	Okay, well, that- Wow, okay, well, umm-then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
s09_e01_c10_u277	Yeah, maybe.
s09_e01_c10_u278	Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y'know if we-if- You're wearing the ring.
s09_e01_c10_u279	Wh-what's that?
s09_e01_c10_u280	And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
s09_e01_c10_u281	I'm sorry, what?
s09_e01_c10_u282	When you thought Joey proposed did-did you say yes?
s09_e01_c11_u283	Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant. (He slides them under the door.)
s09_e01_c11_u284	(walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!
s09_e01_c11_u285	Hey.
s09_e01_c11_u286	(pause) Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets back? (They do so.) Thank you.
s07_e23_c01_u001	Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
s07_e23_c01_u002	Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.) Oh! (Realizes.)
s07_e23_c01_u003	Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
s07_e23_c01_u004	Old?
s07_e23_c01_u005	The young hot ball and chain.
s07_e23_c01_u006	That's much better.
s07_e23_c01_u007	(checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.)
s07_e23_c01_u008	Oh, where are you guys going?
s07_e23_c01_u009	We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom. (Joey stands up.)
s07_e23_c01_u010	Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
s07_e23_c01_u011	No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! (They all exit.)
s07_e23_c01_u012	(To Chandler) Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
s07_e23_c01_u013	What's up?
s07_e23_c01_u014	Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
s07_e23_c01_u015	Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
s07_e23_c01_u016	No, its-Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
s07_e23_c01_u017	But you're still my friend?
s07_e23_c01_u018	Not for the next few minutes.
s07_e23_c01_u019	During this time-are you, are you still my best man?
s07_e23_c01_u020	Nope.
s07_e23_c01_u021	Do I still call you Ross?
s07_e23_c01_u022	Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
s07_e23_c01_u023	(smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
s07_e23_c01_u024	No problem.
s07_e23_c01_u025	So are we-friends again?
s07_e23_c01_u026	Yeah.
s07_e23_c01_u027	Okay. (Pause) You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
s07_e23_c02_u028	What cha doing Mon?
s07_e23_c02_u029	I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
s07_e23_c02_u030	What are they?
s07_e23_c02_u031	Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
s07_e23_c02_u032	Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
s07_e23_c02_u033	I had to go with the odds Rach.
s07_e23_c02_u034	(entering) Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
s07_e23_c02_u035	The commercial?
s07_e23_c02_u036	No!
s07_e23_c02_u037	That play?
s07_e23_c02_u038	No!
s07_e23_c02_u039	That other play?
s07_e23_c02_u040	Nooo!
s07_e23_c02_u041	The movie?
s07_e23_c02_u042	Yes!!
s07_e23_c02_u043	Ohh!
s07_e23_c02_u044	Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
s07_e23_c02_u045	Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!
s07_e23_c02_u046	Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
s07_e23_c02_u047	Congratulations!
s07_e23_c02_u048	Oh that's great!
s07_e23_c02_u049	Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
s07_e23_c02_u050	Oh no, I'll be done by then.
s07_e23_c02_u051	Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
s07_e23_c02_u052	I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis.
s07_e23_c02_u053	Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.
s07_e23_c02_u054	Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? (Rachel pauses as she thinks.)
s07_e23_c02_u055	Go ahead.
s07_e23_c02_u056	You're gonna be late! Go! Go! (He runs out.)
s07_e23_c02_u057	Who did we fight in World War I?
s07_e23_c02_u058	Mexico?
s07_e23_c02_u059	Yes! Very good.
s07_e23_c03_u060	(approaching) Hey Joey! We're ready.
s07_e23_c03_u061	Yeah! Me too. (He pats his pocket.)
s07_e23_c03_u062	(to another actor) Richard? We're ready for you. (Richard approaches.) Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.
s07_e23_c03_u063	I'm doing my scenes with you?
s07_e23_c03_u064	Nice to meet you Joey.
s07_e23_c03_u065	Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
s07_e23_c03_u066	No I didn't.
s07_e23_c03_u067	I think you did.
s07_e23_c03_u068	I think I lost. Three times.
s07_e23_c03_u069	Uh-Cookie?
s07_e23_c03_u070	(approaching) Okay! We're about an hour away from getting the scene lit. So uh, if you guys don't mind, can we run it a couple of times?
s07_e23_c03_u071	Yeah, sure.
s07_e23_c03_u072	Okay, all right. Let's do it. (He walks off.) And-Action!
s07_e23_c03_u073	We have to find the rest of the platoon!
s07_e23_c03_u074	Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone! (He is spitting on the hard Ps and Ts.)
s07_e23_c03_u075	(wiping his face) What?!
s07_e23_c03_u076	(still spitting) The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
s07_e23_c03_u077	(wipes face) So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
s07_e23_c03_u078	No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
s07_e23_c03_u079	Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
s07_e23_c03_u080	(glances at Richard) No. Nope, I uh-I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher. (Behind his back, Richard is nodding no.)
s07_e23_c03_u081	I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. (Walks off.) Action!
s07_e23_c03_u082	We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna! (Joey backs away and wipes his face again.)
s07_e23_c04_u083	Honey, we gotta go!
s07_e23_c04_u084	(entering from the bedroom) Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
s07_e23_c04_u085	(laughs) I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
s07_e23_c04_u086	Yes, include more people in this.
s07_e23_c04_u087	Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?
s07_e23_c04_u088	Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
s07_e23_c04_u089	I just, I can't believe that we made it!
s07_e23_c04_u090	Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
s07_e23_c04_u091	I'm sorry but-nothing.
s07_e23_c04_u092	What?
s07_e23_c04_u093	Well-honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.
s07_e23_c04_u094	Honestly? Me too.
s07_e23_c04_u095	Really?
s07_e23_c04_u096	Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all-Chandler. But nothing has.
s07_e23_c04_u097	Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. (Chandler just looks at her.) I coulda been worse!
s07_e23_c04_u098	Okay. I'll be right there.
s07_e23_c04_u099	(voice on answering machine) Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!
s07_e23_c05_u100	Hey Maureen! (They hug.) Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.
s07_e23_c05_u101	We're the Bings.
s07_e23_c05_u102	Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
s07_e23_c05_u103	Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)
s07_e23_c05_u104	(walks up) Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.
s07_e23_c05_u105	What is that?
s07_e23_c05_u106	Well I-I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! (The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)
s07_e23_c05_u107	Ross, please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)
s07_e23_c05_u108	Hi.
s07_e23_c05_u109	Chandler!
s07_e23_c05_u110	Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (She's wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)
s07_e23_c05_u111	Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come. Oh and just think. Soon there'll be lots of little Bings. (He freaks out and loosens the tie again.)
s07_e23_c05_u112	Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
s07_e23_c05_u113	(shaking her hand) It's lovely to meet you.
s07_e23_c05_u114	(shaking her hand) So are you his mother or his father?
s07_e23_c05_u115	Jack!
s07_e23_c05_u116	What?! I've never seen one before!
s07_e23_c05_u117	Dad! There's Ross (points), why don't you go talk to him?
s07_e23_c05_u118	I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
s07_e23_c05_u119	(entering) Hello all!
s07_e23_c05_u120	Hi-dad.
s07_e23_c05_u121	Hi Mr.-Bing.
s07_e23_c05_u122	Nora!
s07_e23_c05_u123	Charles.
s07_e23_c05_u124	It-it's so great to see you both here.
s07_e23_c05_u125	Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
s07_e23_c05_u126	Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
s07_e23_c05_u127	Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
s07_e23_c05_u128	of course you can kick his ass son.
s07_e23_c05_u129	You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
s07_e23_c05_u130	Thanks you guys. (Walks away happily and his parents smile.)
s07_e23_c05_u131	Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
s07_e23_c05_u132	Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
s07_e23_c05_u133	He is the man in the black dress.
s07_e23_c05_u134	Man in the black dress- (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
s07_e23_c05_u135	I'm Amanda.
s07_e23_c05_u136	Oh I get it! A-man-duh!
s07_e23_c05_u137	(clinking a wine glass) Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
s07_e23_c05_u138	Doctor Ross Geller.
s07_e23_c05_u139	Dad-dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings.
s07_e23_c05_u140	To the Bings!
s07_e23_c06_u141	All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
s07_e23_c06_u142	I'll do it.
s07_e23_c06_u143	Who wants it? Anybody?
s07_e23_c06_u144	I said I'll do it!
s07_e23_c06_u145	Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
s07_e23_c06_u146	Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
s07_e23_c06_u147	Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
s07_e23_c06_u148	Well of course that is what I'm here for!
s07_e23_c06_u149	Okay. Sorry. (Monica goes into the bathroom.)
s07_e23_c06_u150	Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?
s07_e23_c07_u151	Hey! Where have you been?
s07_e23_c07_u152	Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
s07_e23_c07_u153	Oh.
s07_e23_c07_u154	What? Are you going back to work?
s07_e23_c07_u155	Yeah.
s07_e23_c07_u156	Nice shades.
s07_e23_c07_u157	Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
s07_e23_c07_u158	And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
s07_e23_c07_u159	Great! All right. I'll see you later. (He starts to leave.)
s07_e23_c07_u160	Hey, where's Chandler?
s07_e23_c07_u161	Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya. (Exits.)
s07_e23_c07_u162	(going up to Rachel's closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and looks inside and doesn't see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still doesn't find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)
s07_e23_c08_u163	Hey!
s07_e23_c08_u164	Hi!
s07_e23_c08_u165	Is uh, is Monica here?
s07_e23_c08_u166	She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
s07_e23_c08_u167	I think Chandler's gone. (He hands her the note.)
s07_e23_c08_u168	What?!
s07_e23_c08_u169	He left that.
s07_e23_c08_u170	(reading the note) Tell Monica I'm sorry.
s07_e23_c08_u171	(walking up) What's up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) Tell Monica I'm sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!
s07_e23_c09_u172	Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
s07_e23_c09_u173	Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I-drank the last of the milk.
s07_e23_c09_u174	Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
s07_e23_c09_u175	I think it means he freaked out and left!
s07_e23_c09_u176	Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there (Joey and Rachel's apartment) right now?!
s07_e23_c09_u177	Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
s07_e23_c09_u178	Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
s07_e23_c09_u179	Okay.
s07_e23_c09_u180	(pointing at Ross) Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
s07_e23_c09_u181	(scared) I will, I will find him.
s07_e23_c10_u182	Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me? (He's holding a script.)
s07_e23_c10_u183	Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
s07_e23_c10_u184	Just the last two pages.
s07_e23_c10_u185	All right.
s07_e23_c10_u186	I found the picture!
s07_e23_c10_u187	Picture? What picture?
s07_e23_c10_u188	Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
s07_e23_c10_u189	Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff
s07_e23_c10_u190	Oh, thanks.
s07_e23_c10_u191	But you're spittin' all over me man!
s07_e23_c10_u192	Well of course I am!
s07_e23_c10_u193	You know you've been spitting on me?!
s07_e23_c10_u194	That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit! (Spits on the t)
s07_e23_c10_u195	(wiping face) Wow! Didn't know that.
s07_e23_c10_u196	Great!
s07_e23_c10_u197	Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! (Reading from the script) Picture? What picture? (He pauses then spits) Eh?
s07_e23_c11_u198	Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
s07_e23_c11_u199	No. No, I haven't seen him.
s07_e23_c11_u200	Oh damn!
s07_e23_c11_u201	He's getting married tomorrow right?
s07_e23_c11_u202	Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine. We'll uh, we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
s07_e23_c11_u203	I wasn't invited.
s07_e23_c11_u204	Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. (Walks away slowly, but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (They're sitting by the window.) What-what-what you guys doing here?!
s07_e23_c11_u205	Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
s07_e23_c11_u206	I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
s07_e23_c11_u207	Why?!
s07_e23_c11_u208	The sexy blonde behind the counter. (She waves at Gunther who waves back.)
s07_e23_c11_u209	(shocked) Gunther?!
s07_e23_c11_u210	Your mother just added him to her list.
s07_e23_c11_u211	What? Your-your list?
s07_e23_c11_u212	Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep
s07_e23_c11_u213	Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
s07_e23_c11_u214	And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
s07_e23_c12_u215	Action!
s07_e23_c12_u216	I found the picture!
s07_e23_c12_u217	What picture?!
s07_e23_c12_u218	The picture of my wife! In your pack!
s07_e23_c12_u219	You went through my personal property?
s07_e23_c12_u220	Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
s07_e23_c12_u221	(pause) Because Vincent, we were lovers. (Pause) For two years!
s07_e23_c12_u222	Cut! Wonderful!
s07_e23_c12_u223	Great scene yeah?
s07_e23_c12_u224	Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
s07_e23_c12_u225	Thanks a lot.
s07_e23_c12_u226	(To Joey) Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
s07_e23_c12_u227	Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
s07_e23_c12_u228	You are now.
s07_e23_c12_u229	No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! (Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.)
s07_e23_c13_u230	(closing the door) Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
s07_e23_c13_u231	Oh man.
s07_e23_c13_u232	Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
s07_e23_c13_u233	Okay. Well there's one down.
s07_e23_c13_u234	(entering from her room, excitedly) I'm getting married today!!! (She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)
s07_e23_c13_u235	Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
s07_e23_c13_u236	(re-entering) I'm gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her room.)
s07_e23_c13_u237	God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown
s07_e23_c13_u238	Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here! (She drags her into the bathroom.)
s07_e23_c13_u239	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just-It's just so sad!
s07_e23_c13_u240	Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
s07_e23_c13_u241	I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
s07_e23_c13_u242	Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
s07_e23_c13_u243	Oh!
s07_e23_c13_u244	No-no! I-I-I found one.
s07_e23_c13_u245	Okay.
s07_e23_c13_u246	Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have another one?
s07_e23_c13_u247	(looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)
s07_e23_c13_u248	Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
s07_e23_c13_u249	Oh here's a whole bunch.
s07_e23_c13_u250	Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
s07_e23_c13_u251	(finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!
s07_e23_c13_u252	What?
s07_e23_c13_u253	There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won't be totally alone.
s07_e23_c14_u254	Oh my God!
s07_e23_c14_u255	I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
s07_e23_c14_u256	Oh my God!
s07_e23_c14_u257	Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
s07_e23_c14_u258	No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
s07_e23_c14_u259	Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this. (She throws the test back into the trash.)
s07_e23_c14_u260	Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
s07_e23_c14_u261	Right.
s07_e23_c14_u262	Okay?
s07_e23_c14_u263	Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
s07_e23_c14_u264	No. Why?
s07_e23_c14_u265	Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
s07_e23_c15_u266	Anything?
s07_e23_c15_u267	No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
s07_e23_c15_u268	You told them he was missing?
s07_e23_c15_u269	No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
s07_e23_c15_u270	All right, we've got to tell her he's gone. (Starts to leave.)
s07_e23_c15_u271	No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
s07_e23_c15_u272	Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
s07_e23_c15_u273	Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
s07_e23_c15_u274	All right, well how much time do you need?
s07_e23_c15_u275	Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
s07_e23_c15_u276	One hour.
s07_e23_c15_u277	Give me two.
s07_e23_c15_u278	Then why do you ask?!
s07_e23_c15_u279	Okay, wish me luck.
s07_e23_c15_u280	Okay. I'm going with you.
s07_e23_c15_u281	Why?!
s07_e23_c15_u282	Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
s07_e23_c15_u283	All right, I'll see you guys later.
s07_e23_c15_u284	Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
s07_e23_c15_u285	I'll figure something out.
s07_e23_c15_u286	All right. Good luck.
s07_e23_c15_u287	Thanks.
s07_e23_c15_u288	Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
s07_e23_c15_u289	Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
s07_e23_c15_u290	About what?
s07_e23_c15_u291	Umm- I'm never gonna getting married!
s07_e23_c15_u292	Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
s07_e23_c15_u293	No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
s07_e23_c15_u294	Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
s07_e23_c15_u295	Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
s07_e23_c15_u296	(jumping up) Rachel! You okay?
s07_e23_c16_u297	Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
s07_e23_c16_u298	Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding. (Starts to walk away.)
s07_e23_c16_u299	I'm having surgery!
s07_e23_c16_u300	What?!
s07_e23_c16_u301	Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
s07_e23_c16_u302	What kind of surgery?!
s07_e23_c16_u303	Transplant.
s07_e23_c16_u304	But you're supposed to work on Monday.
s07_e23_c16_u305	Hair transplant.
s07_e23_c16_u306	But you're not bald.
s07_e23_c16_u307	It's not on my head.
s07_e23_c16_u308	Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. (Walks away and sees Richard entering.) Morning Richard.
s07_e23_c16_u309	Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
s07_e23_c16_u310	I'm wearing two belts.
s07_e23_c16_u311	Are you drunk?
s07_e23_c16_u312	No!
s07_e23_c16_u313	Yes you are!
s07_e23_c16_u314	All right.
s07_e23_c17_u315	We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
s07_e23_c17_u316	Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)
s07_e23_c17_u317	That is an old, Chinese woman!
s07_e23_c17_u318	He could be in disguise, y'know.
s07_e23_c17_u319	Aw, y'know-Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
s07_e23_c17_u320	So this is your office?
s07_e23_c17_u321	How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
s07_e23_c17_u322	What the hell are you doing?!
s07_e23_c17_u323	Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
s07_e23_c17_u324	She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
s07_e23_c17_u325	No! No! No! I can't do that!
s07_e23_c17_u326	Why not?!
s07_e23_c17_u327	Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
s07_e23_c17_u328	What's wrong with being the Bings?
s07_e23_c17_u329	The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
s07_e23_c17_u330	Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
s07_e23_c17_u331	No.
s07_e23_c17_u332	Then you are neither of your parents!
s07_e23_c17_u333	It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
s07_e23_c17_u334	But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
s07_e23_c17_u335	I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr-It's too huge.
s07_e23_c17_u336	Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
s07_e23_c17_u337	Well yeah, but then
s07_e23_c17_u338	(interrupting him) Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
s07_e23_c17_u339	Depends on what you mean by we.
s07_e23_c18_u340	The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again
s07_e23_c18_u341	(interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
s07_e23_c18_u342	I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
s07_e23_c18_u343	(getting up) I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour! (Starts for the bathroom.)
s07_e23_c18_u344	Okay. But wait!
s07_e23_c18_u345	What?!
s07_e23_c18_u346	Let's go to lunch.
s07_e23_c18_u347	I can't go to lunch!!
s07_e23_c18_u348	Right.
s07_e23_c18_u349	Oh good God! I've fallen down! (She trips and falls.)
s07_e23_c18_u350	(entering) What's going on?
s07_e23_c18_u351	Okay. All right. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
s07_e23_c18_u352	Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
s07_e23_c18_u353	We can't find Chandler-(Phoebe sticks her head and motions that they found Chandler)-s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
s07_e23_c18_u354	How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
s07_e23_c18_u355	(entering) Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again
s07_e23_c18_u356	Oh!
s07_e23_c18_u357	Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
s07_e23_c19_u358	I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
s07_e23_c19_u359	That can be arranged.
s07_e23_c19_u360	Let's reset.
s07_e23_c19_u361	What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
s07_e23_c19_u362	Let's take it from there.
s07_e23_c19_u363	(To Joey) Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
s07_e23_c19_u364	Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
s07_e23_c19_u365	Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
s07_e23_c19_u366	Thank you. Thank you.
s07_e23_c19_u367	Still rolling, annnnd action!
s07_e23_c19_u368	I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
s07_e23_c19_u369	Now, that can be arranged! (He brings his sword back and drops it, causing it to fly over the wall.) Slippery little bugger!
s07_e23_c20_u370	So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
s07_e23_c20_u371	Here comes the bride.
s07_e23_c20_u372	Oh my God Monica!
s07_e23_c20_u373	I wanna wear this everyday.
s07_e23_c20_u374	You look so beautiful.
s07_e23_c20_u375	(starting to cry) I'm so happy for me.
s07_e23_c20_u376	Hello?
s07_e23_c20_u377	(on phone) Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
s07_e23_c20_u378	Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
s07_e23_c20_u379	Damnit!
s07_e23_c20_u380	What? Why? Where are you?
s07_e23_c20_u381	I'm still on the set!
s07_e23_c20_u382	Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
s07_e23_c20_u383	I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
s07_e23_c20_u384	Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
s07_e23_c20_u385	No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
s07_e23_c20_u386	Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
s07_e23_c20_u387	Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
s07_e23_c21_u388	There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
s07_e23_c21_u389	No.
s07_e23_c21_u390	I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
s07_e23_c21_u391	Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
s07_e23_c21_u392	Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
s07_e23_c21_u393	Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
s07_e23_c21_u394	Yeah.
s07_e23_c21_u395	Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)
s07_e23_c21_u396	Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
s07_e23_c21_u397	Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
s07_e23_c21_u398	Okay.
s07_e23_c21_u399	Okay.
s07_e23_c21_u400	Oh fresh air!
s07_e23_c21_u401	(To Rachel) Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
s07_e23_c21_u402	Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
s07_e23_c21_u403	Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
s07_e23_c21_u404	Okay.
s07_e23_c21_u405	Okay.
s07_e23_c22_u406	Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.}(The happy couple emerges.) Congratulations. (To the best man and maid of honor) Mazel Tov! (The rabbi emerges.) Hi! Oh, great hat. (He's wearing an interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
s07_e23_c22_u407	I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
s07_e23_c22_u408	Yeah! Yeah. They're-they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
s07_e23_c23_u409	Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
s07_e23_c23_u410	I thought he was with you.
s07_e23_c23_u411	He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
s07_e23_c23_u412	You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
s07_e23_c23_u413	(pause) You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
s07_e23_c23_u414	Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
s07_e23_c23_u415	As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
s07_e23_c23_u416	But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
s07_e23_c23_u417	Honey, it isn't good luck.
s07_e23_c23_u418	Oh my God! Monica!
s07_e23_c23_u419	I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
s07_e23_c23_u420	Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
s07_e23_c23_u421	Are you okay?
s07_e23_c23_u422	Uh-huh.
s07_e23_c23_u423	Well, you're-you're sweating.
s07_e23_c23_u424	These-these are beads of joy.
s07_e23_c23_u425	Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
s07_e23_c23_u426	Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
s07_e23_c23_u427	Yeah!
s07_e23_c23_u428	What's going on?
s07_e23_c23_u429	Chandler's gone again!
s07_e23_c23_u430	Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
s07_e23_c24_u431	Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
s07_e23_c24_u432	I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
s07_e23_c24_u433	You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
s07_e23_c24_u434	So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
s07_e23_c24_u435	Well have we finished the scene?
s07_e23_c24_u436	Yeah! You-you were wonderful.
s07_e23_c24_u437	As were you.
s07_e23_c24_u438	So I got your car, it's right outside.
s07_e23_c24_u439	Why? Are we done for the day?
s07_e23_c24_u440	That's what you told me.
s07_e23_c24_u441	Oh, thank you. You're welcome. (He stands up, staggers to the couch, and starts to lie down.)
s07_e23_c24_u442	No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! (Joey picks him up in a fireman's carry and carries him out.) Here we go.
s07_e23_c24_u443	Is that my ass? (He's looking at Joey's.)
s07_e23_c25_u444	(turning a corner) There he is!!
s07_e23_c25_u445	What?
s07_e23_c25_u446	Hey! Oh!
s07_e23_c25_u447	You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
s07_e23_c25_u448	Ross! (He starts to get up.)
s07_e23_c25_u449	Hiiii-Ya!! (Chandler lies back down.) I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
s07_e23_c25_u450	(standing up) That's right! I'm not!
s07_e23_c25_u451	Then where the hell have you been?!
s07_e23_c25_u452	I know about Monica.
s07_e23_c25_u453	You know?!
s07_e23_c25_u454	What?
s07_e23_c25_u455	Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
s07_e23_c25_u456	What?! What?! Talking about what?!
s07_e23_c25_u457	You don't know?
s07_e23_c25_u458	Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now
s07_e23_c25_u459	What? You'll hi-ya?
s07_e23_c25_u460	Monica's pregnant.
s07_e23_c25_u461	Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're-you're not freaking out?
s07_e23_c25_u462	Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes
s07_e23_c25_u463	Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
s07_e23_c25_u464	Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
s07_e23_c25_u465	But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
s07_e23_c25_u466	Dude. (Hugs him.)
s07_e23_c25_u467	Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
s07_e23_c26_u468	Our little boy is getting married.
s07_e23_c26_u469	Oh look at you! So handsome!
s07_e23_c26_u470	You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I'm so glad you here. (He kisses his mom.)
s07_e23_c26_u471	Are you Chandler?
s07_e23_c26_u472	Are you Joey?
s07_e23_c26_u473	Huh. This is nice.
s07_e23_c26_u474	What?
s07_e23_c26_u475	I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
s07_e23_c26_u476	Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
s07_e23_c26_u477	She's right there.
s07_e23_c26_u478	Not that old crow, my mother. (They stop and she kisses Monica on the cheek.) Congratulations darling.
s07_e23_c26_u479	I love you sweetheart. (He kisses her and they sit down.)
s07_e23_c26_u480	You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)
s07_e23_c26_u481	Not now.
s07_e23_c26_u482	Okay.
s07_e23_c26_u483	(To Chandler) Who is this?
s07_e23_c26_u484	I am Father Kalebasous.
s07_e23_c26_u485	(in Monica's ear) He's Greek Orthodox.
s07_e23_c26_u486	(leaning in) As are you
s07_e23_c26_u487	Let us begin. Dearly beloved
s07_e23_c26_u488	(entering) That's my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, (He's still in costume) but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
s07_e23_c26_u489	(To Rachel) He took off?
s07_e23_c26_u490	Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)
s07_e23_c26_u491	Chandler, for so long I-I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now-here we are-with our future before us-and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
s07_e23_c26_u492	Chandler?
s07_e23_c26_u493	(To Ross) No, that's okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)
s07_e23_c26_u494	You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
s07_e23_c26_u495	I do.
s07_e23_c26_u496	I do.
s07_e23_c26_u497	Yeah you do!
s07_e23_c26_u498	Rings?
s07_e23_c26_u499	Aw crap! Okay-uh-uh let's-let's do the rings.
s07_e23_c26_u500	We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To Chandler) Now kiss her again.
s07_e23_c26_u501	(To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.
s07_e23_c26_u502	What baby?
s07_e23_c26_u503	Our baby.
s07_e23_c26_u504	We have a baby?
s07_e23_c26_u505	Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
s07_e23_c26_u506	I didn't take a pregnancy test.
s07_e23_c26_u507	Then-who did?
s07_e23_c26_u508	Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
s07_e23_c26_u509	Uh-huh.
s08_e18_c01_u001	Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
s08_e18_c01_u002	Yeah.
s08_e18_c01_u003	Sure. Yeah.
s08_e18_c01_u004	So, who's the guy?
s08_e18_c01_u005	Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
s08_e18_c01_u006	Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said that?
s08_e18_c01_u007	Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
s08_e18_c01_u008	(To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
s08_e18_c01_u009	Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
s08_e18_c01_u010	Yeah, I'd really like to.
s08_e18_c01_u011	Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you.
s08_e18_c01_u012	Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.
s08_e18_c01_u013	And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
s08_e18_c01_u014	No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they'll say this year? "God, you"
s08_e18_c01_u015	Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to himself) I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)
s08_e18_c01_u016	Really you can do that?
s08_e18_c01_u017	Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!
s08_e18_c02_u018	What are you doing?
s08_e18_c02_u019	Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)
s08_e18_c02_u020	It's a dog.
s08_e18_c02_u021	It's a dead dog. That's Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
s08_e18_c02_u022	It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
s08_e18_c02_u023	The good stuff, huh?
s08_e18_c02_u024	Hi!
s08_e18_c02_u025	Hey!
s08_e18_c02_u026	Hey!
s08_e18_c02_u027	You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.
s08_e18_c02_u028	Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
s08_e18_c02_u029	Aww that is so cool.
s08_e18_c02_u030	And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
s08_e18_c02_u031	Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
s08_e18_c02_u032	Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.
s08_e18_c02_u033	(picking up Chi-Chi's picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
s08_e18_c02_u034	What?!
s08_e18_c02_u035	You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
s08_e18_c02_u036	Hey!
s08_e18_c02_u037	Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is
s08_e18_c02_u038	No, no, no wait! Don't tell me. Let me guess. (Points as he says their names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I'm sorry Phoebe didn't mention you. (Chandler makes a face) Chandler, I'm kidding all ready you're my favorite!
s08_e18_c02_u039	Ha!
s08_e18_c02_u040	Why don't all of you tell me a little about your self?
s08_e18_c02_u041	Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going.
s08_e18_c02_u042	(laughs) Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? (Puts hand on her stomach)
s08_e18_c02_u043	I, uh, think you already are.
s08_e18_c02_u044	Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than-Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
s08_e18_c02_u045	That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
s08_e18_c02_u046	Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where's the party?
s08_e18_c02_u047	It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
s08_e18_c02_u048	Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber's Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwin was born in Massapequa.}
s08_e18_c02_u049	Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tee-pee.
s08_e18_c02_u050	Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents?
s08_e18_c02_u051	Yeah.
s08_e18_c02_u052	And I've got the car keys.
s08_e18_c02_u053	We're driving!?
s08_e18_c02_u054	Yeah.
s08_e18_c02_u055	Aces!
s08_e18_c02_u056	So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
s08_e18_c02_u057	Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
s08_e18_c02_u058	Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
s08_e18_c02_u059	Yeah, otherwise I'm not going.
s08_e18_c03_u060	Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.
s08_e18_c03_u061	This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
s08_e18_c03_u062	Jack?
s08_e18_c03_u063	Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? (Looking a toothpick)
s08_e18_c03_u064	That's a good question, dad. That's a good question
s08_e18_c03_u065	Hmmm-.
s08_e18_c03_u066	Woman: (To Ross and Rachel) Congratulations you two!
s08_e18_c03_u067	Thank you-we're so excited
s08_e18_c03_u068	Woman: And also, congratulations on your wedding.
s08_e18_c03_u069	Wha-What?
s08_e18_c03_u070	Can we talk to you for just a y'know- It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married.
s08_e18_c03_u071	Thanks for going along with this.
s08_e18_c03_u072	Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married?
s08_e18_c03_u073	Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
s08_e18_c03_u074	Can you believe that?
s08_e18_c03_u075	Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
s08_e18_c03_u076	No, us having to lie about being married.
s08_e18_c03_u077	No, I know I don't either, but ya know what, it's their party, and it's just one night. And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything. If it comes up again, we'll just-smile. We'll nod along.
s08_e18_c03_u078	Woman: Ross!
s08_e18_c03_u079	Rachel!
s08_e18_c03_u080	Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
s08_e18_c03_u081	Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding
s08_e18_c03_u082	Here's a little something to get you started. (Hands them a check)
s08_e18_c03_u083	Oh
s08_e18_c03_u084	So, how's married life treating you?
s08_e18_c03_u085	(looking at the check) Unbelievable!
s08_e18_c03_u086	We love marriage!
s08_e18_c03_u087	Great!
s08_e18_c03_u088	Hey
s08_e18_c03_u089	Hey!
s08_e18_c03_u090	What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C-I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don't want to forget this moment! It's like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! (He takes a mental picture of them all.)
s08_e18_c03_u091	I don't think the flash went off.
s08_e18_c03_u092	Dahaaa! (Punches Chandler in the arm and he makes a face of pain.) I'm going to find the men's room, be right back.
s08_e18_c03_u093	I'll go with you
s08_e18_c03_u094	Come on!
s08_e18_c03_u095	Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
s08_e18_c03_u096	I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
s08_e18_c03_u097	I'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?
s08_e18_c03_u098	He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
s08_e18_c03_u099	(imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry-(He looks behind him then notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)
s08_e18_c03_u100	Were you guys making fun of Parker?
s08_e18_c03_u101	That depends, how much did you hear?
s08_e18_c03_u102	So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?
s08_e18_c03_u103	It's just that, it's so much.
s08_e18_c03_u104	Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap. (Walks off)
s08_e18_c03_u105	I feel terrible.
s08_e18_c03_u106	I know
s08_e18_c03_u107	What was wrong with Mona?
s08_e18_c04_u108	Open it! Open it! Open it!
s08_e18_c04_u109	Yeah baby!
s08_e18_c04_u110	So we never got to hear about your wedding!
s08_e18_c04_u111	Woman: We were surprise that we weren't invited.
s08_e18_c04_u112	No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
s08_e18_c04_u113	But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
s08_e18_c04_u114	Where did you have it?
s08_e18_c04_u115	On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn't She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
s08_e18_c04_u116	Woman: Really?
s08_e18_c04_u117	Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend. (Hits Ross's chest)
s08_e18_c04_u118	Woman: Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
s08_e18_c04_u119	So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
s08_e18_c04_u120	Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side) Umm-. what are you doing?
s08_e18_c04_u121	What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
s08_e18_c04_u122	Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
s08_e18_c04_u123	Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
s08_e18_c04_u124	Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
s08_e18_c04_u125	No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
s08_e18_c04_u126	And I'm with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing. (Bounces the plates) What an inspired solution to man's plate dispensing problems.
s08_e18_c04_u127	Hm huh, yeah.
s08_e18_c04_u128	Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
s08_e18_c04_u129	No, that's not necessary.
s08_e18_c04_u130	Please.
s08_e18_c04_u131	No, actually I don't eat
s08_e18_c04_u132	I won't quit until you try.
s08_e18_c04_u133	Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while dropping it on the floor) Mmm-hmmmmm-.
s08_e18_c04_u134	What are they like? I've never had one.
s08_e18_c04_u135	Why don't you just try one?
s08_e18_c04_u136	No, they look too weird.
s08_e18_c04_u137	What are you doin'?
s08_e18_c04_u138	Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.
s08_e18_c04_u139	Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could (Punches the air).
s08_e18_c04_u140	And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
s08_e18_c04_u141	Woman: Blind?
s08_e18_c04_u142	Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
s08_e18_c04_u143	I'll bet you looked beautiful
s08_e18_c04_u144	Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
s08_e18_c04_u145	Woman: (To Ross) So, how did you propose?
s08_e18_c04_u146	Oh yeah. That's a great story.
s08_e18_c04_u147	Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That's-that's where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower
s08_e18_c04_u148	Oh that is so sweet!
s08_e18_c04_u149	Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
s08_e18_c04_u150	Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
s08_e18_c04_u151	And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!
s08_e18_c04_u152	Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.
s08_e18_c04_u153	Then you better do it now.
s08_e18_c04_u154	Why?
s08_e18_c04_u155	Because I'm going to kill him
s08_e18_c04_u156	What-what?
s08_e18_c04_u157	You guys were right. He's just too excited about-everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.
s08_e18_c04_u158	I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
s08_e18_c04_u159	Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
s08_e18_c04_u160	I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.
s08_e18_c04_u161	He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.
s08_e18_c04_u162	Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.
s08_e18_c04_u163	You think?
s08_e18_c04_u164	Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
s08_e18_c04_u165	You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.
s08_e18_c04_u166	Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
s08_e18_c04_u167	What's that now?
s08_e18_c04_u168	Nothing
s08_e18_c04_u169	Oh look it's Parker!
s08_e18_c04_u170	Look! It's the bunny hop!
s08_e18_c04_u171	Oooh I love it!
s08_e18_c04_u172	You do?!
s08_e18_c04_u173	Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
s08_e18_c04_u174	Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.
s08_e18_c04_u175	No, no it's going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she's dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits for people to cry, but doesn't get any tears.) You people are made of stone! Here's to mom and dad! Whatever!
s08_e18_c04_u176	Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
s08_e18_c04_u177	(looking at the picture) Why don't I remember this dog?
s08_e18_c04_u178	Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?
s08_e18_c04_u179	Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.
s08_e18_c04_u180	You're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary
s08_e18_c04_u181	No, of course, Um- Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say-on behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that if-if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
s08_e18_c04_u182	(crying) Oh Ross
s08_e18_c04_u183	I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross's toast.
s08_e18_c05_u184	My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
s08_e18_c05_u185	Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
s08_e18_c05_u186	I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words
s08_e18_c05_u187	Oh thank God.
s08_e18_c05_u188	It's a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst
s08_e18_c05_u189	Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
s08_e18_c05_u190	That sounds great. (Sits down) My God this is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)
s08_e18_c05_u191	Let's try something else, let's play a game.
s08_e18_c05_u192	I love games!
s08_e18_c05_u193	Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. (Giggles)
s08_e18_c05_u194	Or-Jenga.
s08_e18_c05_u195	But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
s08_e18_c05_u196	I lose, now Jenga.
s08_e18_c05_u197	Oh my God! Oh my God!
s08_e18_c05_u198	Is something wrong?
s08_e18_c05_u199	Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
s08_e18_c05_u200	Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
s08_e18_c05_u201	You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
s08_e18_c05_u202	I'm sorry that's who I am. I'm a positive person.
s08_e18_c05_u203	No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
s08_e18_c05_u204	So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?
s08_e18_c05_u205	Much less happy!
s08_e18_c05_u206	Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I'd better be going."
s08_e18_c05_u207	So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)
s08_e18_c05_u208	Isn't this the most incredible fight you've ever had in your entire life?
s08_e18_c05_u209	Uh huh. (Closes door)
s08_e18_c06_u210	and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
s08_e18_c06_u211	Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
s08_e18_c06_u212	But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
s08_e18_c06_u213	It was really fun being married to you tonight.
s08_e18_c06_u214	Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.
s08_e18_c06_u215	Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
s08_e18_c06_u216	Yeah.
s08_e18_c06_u217	That proposal, at the planetarium
s08_e18_c06_u218	I know, I know it was stupid.
s08_e18_c06_u219	Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was-really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
s08_e18_c06_u220	No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
s08_e18_c06_u221	Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
s08_e18_c06_u222	It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night
s08_e18_c06_u223	Goodnight
s08_e18_c06_u224	Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
s08_e18_c06_u225	I will think about it.
s08_e18_c06_u226	That's all I'm askin'
s08_e18_c07_u227	Okay that's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.
s08_e18_c07_u228	Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
s08_e18_c07_u229	Oh, come on.
s08_e18_c07_u230	Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
s08_e18_c07_u231	(starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
s05_e01_c01_u001	Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. (Time lapse) Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...
s05_e01_c01_u002	I Ross...
s05_e01_c01_u003	Take thee, Emily...
s05_e01_c01_u004	Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.
s05_e01_c01_u005	(Looking and feeling awkward. he looks towards Emily.) Uhh...Shall I go on?
s05_e01_c01_u006	(To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
s05_e01_c01_u007	Yes, yes, do go on.
s05_e01_c01_u008	I think we'd better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross
s05_e01_c01_u009	I, Ross
s05_e01_c01_u010	Take thee, EM-I-LY
s05_e01_c01_u011	Take thee, (Glares at the Minister) Emily. (Chuckles) Like there'd be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)
s05_e01_c01_u012	As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.
s05_e01_c01_u013	As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.)
s05_e01_c01_u014	May I have the rings? (He is given the rings) Emily, place this ring on Ross's finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting. (She jams the ring onto his finger) Ross, place this ring in Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
s05_e01_c01_u015	Happy too.
s05_e01_c01_u016	Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
s05_e01_c01_u017	Yay!
s05_e01_c01_u018	You may kiss the bride.
s05_e01_c01_u019	(To Mr. Geller) This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
s05_e01_c01_u020	Just keep smiling.
s05_e01_c01_u021	Okay.
s05_e01_c01_u022	Well, that went well. Yeah.
s05_e01_c01_u023	It could've been worse, he could've shot her.
s05_e01_c01_u024	(laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?
s05_e01_c02_u025	(Yelling from inside the bathroom) You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
s05_e01_c02_u026	(To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
s05_e01_c02_u027	(exiting the bathroom) That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the gang) She's just fixing her makeup.
s05_e01_c02_u028	I hate you!!
s05_e01_c02_u029	And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)
s05_e01_c02_u030	Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
s05_e01_c02_u031	That's true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)
s05_e01_c02_u032	Yes, Waltham interiors.
s05_e01_c02_u033	(On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
s05_e01_c02_u034	Who?
s05_e01_c02_u035	Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
s05_e01_c02_u036	Oh my God, Phoebe.
s05_e01_c02_u037	No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
s05_e01_c02_u038	Hello?
s05_e01_c02_u039	Hey.
s05_e01_c02_u040	Hey.
s05_e01_c02_u041	Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
s05_e01_c02_u042	I know. How could we have let this happen?
s05_e01_c02_u043	Seven times!
s05_e01_c02_u044	Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away
s05_e01_c02_u045	In a foreign, romantic country
s05_e01_c02_u046	I blame London.
s05_e01_c02_u047	Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
s05_e01_c02_u048	So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
s05_e01_c02_u049	Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
s05_e01_c02_u050	Only here.
s05_e01_c02_u051	Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs
s05_e01_c02_u052	I'll meet you there in two minutes.
s05_e01_c02_u053	Okay!
s05_e01_c02_u054	Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
s05_e01_c02_u055	(impatiently) Now?
s05_e01_c02_u056	Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
s05_e01_c02_u057	Oh, I-I don't know.
s05_e01_c02_u058	Monica, what should I do?
s05_e01_c02_u059	Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)
s05_e01_c02_u060	What?
s05_e01_c02_u061	Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)
s05_e01_c02_u062	Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
s05_e01_c02_u063	Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
s05_e01_c02_u064	Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
s05_e01_c02_u065	Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
s05_e01_c02_u066	(walking by) Yes.
s05_e01_c02_u067	Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
s05_e01_c02_u068	Hey, what's up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he's eating it with his hands.)
s05_e01_c02_u069	Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
s05_e01_c02_u070	Forget it, that's off.
s05_e01_c02_u071	Why?!
s05_e01_c02_u072	(drunkenly) The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes
s05_e01_c02_u073	Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
s05_e01_c02_u074	Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
s05_e01_c02_u075	That's true.
s05_e01_c02_u076	The man's got a point.
s05_e01_c02_u077	Oh, hi!
s05_e01_c02_u078	Hi!
s05_e01_c02_u079	Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
s05_e01_c02_u080	Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
s05_e01_c02_u081	Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
s05_e01_c02_u082	No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you
s05_e01_c02_u083	Right
s05_e01_c02_u084	But it absolutely didn't. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn't!! It didn't!!
s05_e01_c02_u085	(approaching) Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so
s05_e01_c02_u086	(sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
s05_e01_c02_u087	You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)
s05_e01_c02_u088	Look, I'm sorry.
s05_e01_c02_u089	Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
s05_e01_c02_u090	(laughs) Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
s05_e01_c02_u091	Oh, right!
s05_e01_c02_u092	Get the hell out of there, y'know?
s05_e01_c02_u093	(Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I'm coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)
s05_e01_c02_u094	Well, look at that, same thing.
s05_e01_c03_u095	Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
s05_e01_c03_u096	Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
s05_e01_c03_u097	Oh, hello Rachel.
s05_e01_c03_u098	Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
s05_e01_c03_u099	Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
s05_e01_c03_u100	Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
s05_e01_c03_u101	Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
s05_e01_c03_u102	(elbows him) Fifteen minutes.
s05_e01_c03_u103	Okay.
s05_e01_c03_u104	Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It's Phoebe!
s05_e01_c03_u105	Oh, yay
s05_e01_c03_u106	Great
s05_e01_c03_u107	Hi!
s05_e01_c03_u108	Hi, so what happened?
s05_e01_c03_u109	Well, Ross said my name.
s05_e01_c03_u110	Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
s05_e01_c03_u111	Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then
s05_e01_c03_u112	(To Monica) Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
s05_e01_c03_u113	But my clothes are-ohh! (They both leave.)
s05_e01_c03_u114	Wow, you look
s05_e01_c03_u115	No time for that!
s05_e01_c03_u116	Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
s05_e01_c03_u117	Well, I've got a girl in here.
s05_e01_c03_u118	No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
s05_e01_c03_u119	Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
s05_e01_c03_u120	Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
s05_e01_c03_u121	Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
s05_e01_c03_u122	Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
s05_e01_c03_u123	My Giant? I love that movie!
s05_e01_c04_u124	You really think this is okay?
s05_e01_c04_u125	Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
s05_e01_c04_u126	Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
s05_e01_c04_u127	Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
s05_e01_c04_u128	Okay!
s05_e01_c04_u129	Okay!
s05_e01_c04_u130	(entering) Emily?!
s05_e01_c04_u131	Nope, not under here!
s05_e01_c04_u132	You didn't find her?
s05_e01_c04_u133	No, I've looked everywhere!
s05_e01_c04_u134	Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
s05_e01_c04_u135	Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
s05_e01_c04_u136	Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
s05_e01_c04_u137	Or 45.
s05_e01_c04_u138	Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)
s05_e01_c04_u139	No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.
s05_e01_c04_u140	Well, it's getting late.
s05_e01_c04_u141	Yeah, we're gonna go.
s05_e01_c04_u142	Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
s05_e01_c04_u143	Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
s05_e01_c04_u144	Yeah, it's a very large plane.
s05_e01_c04_u145	(disappointed) That's cool.
s05_e01_c04_u146	But, we'll stay here with you.
s05_e01_c04_u147	Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
s05_e01_c05_u148	We have to leave for New York in an hour.
s05_e01_c05_u149	I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
s05_e01_c05_u150	We can't do that that's insane. I mean A' he could wake up and B' y'know, let's go for it.
s05_e01_c05_u151	Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)
s05_e01_c05_u152	No.
s05_e01_c05_u153	You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
s05_e01_c05_u154	We've come for her things.
s05_e01_c05_u155	Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
s05_e01_c05_u156	She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
s05_e01_c05_u157	We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
s05_e01_c05_u158	Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
s05_e01_c05_u159	Oh yes, there you are.
s05_e01_c05_u160	(entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside- (Sees the Walthams and stops.)
s05_e01_c05_u161	Goodbye Geller.
s05_e01_c05_u162	Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
s05_e01_c05_u163	All right, I'll tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face!
s05_e01_c05_u164	(As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me.
s05_e01_c05_u165	You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
s05_e01_c06_u166	Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
s05_e01_c06_u167	Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
s05_e01_c06_u168	I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
s05_e01_c06_u169	Kay!
s05_e01_c06_u170	Can I ask you something?
s05_e01_c06_u171	Uhh, no.
s05_e01_c06_u172	Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
s05_e01_c06_u173	No.
s05_e01_c06_u174	I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
s05_e01_c06_u175	Yes.
s05_e01_c06_u176	Thanks man.
s05_e01_c06_u177	Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
s05_e01_c06_u178	But what about how much taller he is than me?
s05_e01_c06_u179	I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
s05_e01_c06_u180	Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
s05_e01_c06_u181	I know!
s05_e01_c06_u182	Had the beef-tips, huh?
s05_e01_c07_u183	Hey!
s05_e01_c07_u184	Hey!
s05_e01_c07_u185	Hi!
s05_e01_c07_u186	(To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You had sex! (They're shocked.)
s05_e01_c07_u187	No we didn't!
s05_e01_c07_u188	I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
s05_e01_c07_u189	Phoebe, I did not have sex.
s05_e01_c07_u190	This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
s05_e01_c07_u191	All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
s05_e01_c07_u192	Oh, me too!
s05_e01_c07_u193	Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
s05_e01_c07_u194	Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
s05_e01_c07_u195	Well, we certainly are alone.
s05_e01_c07_u196	Yes! Good thing we have that, Not in New York' rule.
s05_e01_c07_u197	Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother
s05_e01_c07_u198	Right.
s05_e01_c07_u199	Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
s05_e01_c07_u200	Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
s05_e01_c07_u201	(laughs) That's okay.
s05_e01_c07_u202	And I'm cute too.
s05_e01_c07_u203	And you're cute too.
s05_e01_c07_u204	Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.
s05_e01_c07_u205	Okay.
s05_e01_c07_u206	Bye.
s05_e01_c07_u207	(entering) I'm still on London time, does that count?
s05_e01_c07_u208	That counts!
s05_e01_c07_u209	Oh, good! (They start kissing.)
s05_e01_c08_u210	Rach! Rach!
s05_e01_c08_u211	(she stops and turns) Hi!
s05_e01_c08_u212	Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
s05_e01_c08_u213	Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
s05_e01_c08_u214	Oh.
s05_e01_c08_u215	Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
s05_e01_c08_u216	Not yet.
s05_e01_c08_u217	So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
s05_e01_c08_u218	Pretty soon I guess.
s05_e01_c08_u219	Yeah. I'm sorry.
s05_e01_c08_u220	I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
s05_e01_c08_u221	No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
s05_e01_c08_u222	Same difference.
s05_e01_c08_u223	I get it! Well, that's that.
s05_e01_c08_u224	No, you know what, I think you should go.
s05_e01_c08_u225	What?
s05_e01_c08_u226	Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
s05_e01_c08_u227	Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know
s05_e01_c08_u228	Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
s05_e01_c08_u229	I could, yeah, I can do that.
s05_e01_c08_u230	Yeah.
s05_e01_c08_u231	I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
s05_e01_c08_u232	Good!
s05_e01_c08_u233	I know, why not?
s05_e01_c08_u234	Right!
s05_e01_c08_u235	Right?
s05_e01_c08_u236	Right!
s05_e01_c08_u237	Y'know-thanks! (They hug)
s05_e01_c08_u238	Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
s05_e01_c08_u239	Yeah, well-nah.
s05_e01_c08_u240	What? Wait, what?
s05_e01_c08_u241	Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
s05_e01_c08_u242	Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
s05_e01_c08_u243	Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
s05_e01_c08_u244	Uh-huh.
s05_e01_c08_u245	No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
s05_e01_c08_u246	Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
s05_e01_c08_u247	Okay!
s05_e01_c08_u248	Okay!
s05_e01_c08_u249	Cool!
s05_e01_c08_u250	All right!
s05_e01_c08_u251	Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate agent.) Here.
s05_e01_c08_u252	Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah.
s05_e01_c08_u253	Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
s05_e01_c08_u254	Oh, wait-wait-wait
s05_e01_c08_u255	You tell them to wait!
s05_e01_c08_u256	Okay. Wait! Wait!
s05_e01_c08_u257	Emily.
s05_e01_c08_u258	Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No! Emily!
s05_e01_c09_u259	Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to Ross's seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. (Realizes that that's not how it works.) Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
s06_e01_c01_u001	Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
s06_e01_c01_u002	Are you sure you wanna do this?
s06_e01_c01_u003	Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)
s06_e01_c01_u004	Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)
s06_e01_c01_u005	Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!
s06_e01_c01_u006	Whoa!
s06_e01_c01_u007	Oh my God!
s06_e01_c01_u008	(entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
s06_e01_c01_u009	Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)
s06_e01_c01_u010	Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
s06_e01_c01_u011	(scolding them) N-No running in the chapel!
s06_e01_c01_u012	(to her) Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey! (Sees Chandler and Monica standing there.)
s06_e01_c01_u013	Hey!
s06_e01_c01_u014	Hey!
s06_e01_c01_u015	What are you guys doing here?
s06_e01_c01_u016	Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
s06_e01_c01_u017	Yes! Well that-yes.
s06_e01_c01_u018	Why else would we be here?
s06_e01_c01_u019	Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
s06_e01_c01_u020	We actually missed it.
s06_e01_c01_u021	Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you (turns to the attendant) run in the chapel!
s06_e01_c01_u022	This is insane!
s06_e01_c01_u023	What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
s06_e01_c01_u024	What?!
s06_e01_c01_u025	Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
s06_e01_c01_u026	What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
s06_e01_c01_u027	(shocked) Really?!
s06_e01_c01_u028	Yeah!
s06_e01_c01_u029	Oh my God!-Eh! Well
s06_e01_c02_u030	Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and groans.)
s06_e01_c02_u031	Why are we in bed together?
s06_e01_c02_u032	I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
s06_e01_c02_u033	(checks) Yeah.
s06_e01_c02_u034	Really?!
s06_e01_c02_u035	No! But we-we didn't have-sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
s06_e01_c02_u036	Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
s06_e01_c02_u037	And we didn't have sex.
s06_e01_c02_u038	Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
s06_e01_c02_u039	(getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has "Just Married" written on his back.)
s06_e01_c03_u040	Mornin' Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
s06_e01_c03_u041	Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
s06_e01_c03_u042	Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
s06_e01_c03_u043	What about my cab?
s06_e01_c03_u044	I don't need that anymore.
s06_e01_c03_u045	No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
s06_e01_c03_u046	I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. (Gets an idea.) Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
s06_e01_c03_u047	I don't know, it's such a long trip.
s06_e01_c03_u048	It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
s06_e01_c03_u049	Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
s06_e01_c03_u050	Sure?
s06_e01_c03_u051	All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
s06_e01_c03_u052	Hi!
s06_e01_c03_u053	Hey.
s06_e01_c03_u054	Hey.
s06_e01_c03_u055	So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
s06_e01_c03_u056	Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
s06_e01_c03_u057	Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
s06_e01_c03_u058	It's a buffet man.
s06_e01_c03_u059	Oh, here's where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the buffet table with Chandler in tow.)
s06_e01_c03_u060	Listen, I gotta talk to you.
s06_e01_c03_u061	Sure! What's up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)
s06_e01_c03_u062	Monica and I almost got married last night.
s06_e01_c03_u063	Oh my God! That's huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
s06_e01_c03_u064	Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
s06_e01_c03_u065	Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
s06_e01_c03_u066	What?!
s06_e01_c03_u067	Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
s06_e01_c03_u068	How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
s06_e01_c03_u069	Well you don't.
s06_e01_c03_u070	Yes I do!
s06_e01_c03_u071	Good! Good! I was just testing you.
s06_e01_c03_u072	(returning with Joey) Hi.
s06_e01_c03_u073	Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
s06_e01_c03_u074	No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
s06_e01_c03_u075	Hey!
s06_e01_c03_u076	Hey!
s06_e01_c03_u077	What?
s06_e01_c03_u078	Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or
s06_e01_c03_u079	(To Ross) I don't know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
s06_e01_c03_u080	Yeah!
s06_e01_c03_u081	Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
s06_e01_c03_u082	Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
s06_e01_c03_u083	(gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
s06_e01_c03_u084	(not quite sure) You did.
s06_e01_c03_u085	What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
s06_e01_c03_u086	No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
s06_e01_c03_u087	We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
s06_e01_c03_u088	Oh my God.
s06_e01_c03_u089	I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
s06_e01_c03_u090	No!
s06_e01_c03_u091	They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
s06_e01_c03_u092	Hell, I'm drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
s06_e01_c03_u093	What are you guys gonna do?
s06_e01_c03_u094	Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)
s06_e01_c03_u095	Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
s06_e01_c03_u096	Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
s06_e01_c03_u097	An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
s06_e01_c03_u098	Oh-oh, that's your thing.
s06_e01_c03_u099	What?
s06_e01_c03_u100	You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
s06_e01_c03_u101	No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
s06_e01_c03_u102	Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I'm so drunk.
s06_e01_c04_u103	So, what do you think we should do?
s06_e01_c04_u104	I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
s06_e01_c04_u105	I know I love you! (They hug.)
s06_e01_c04_u106	So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
s06_e01_c04_u107	That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
s06_e01_c04_u108	Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
s06_e01_c04_u109	All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
s06_e01_c04_u110	Sounds great.
s06_e01_c04_u111	Okay. (They approach the craps table.)
s06_e01_c04_u112	Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
s06_e01_c04_u113	Ready?
s06_e01_c04_u114	Ready!
s06_e01_c04_u115	(sarcastic) Come on eight.
s06_e01_c04_u116	(deadpan) Yes, yes eight.
s06_e01_c04_u117	Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and they're stunned.)
s06_e01_c04_u118	Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
s06_e01_c04_u119	That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
s06_e01_c04_u120	Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
s06_e01_c04_u121	That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
s06_e01_c04_u122	I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?
s06_e01_c04_u123	Yeah. (They go pack.) We're doing the right thing, right?
s06_e01_c04_u124	Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler and Monica standing side-by-side holding each other's hands.)
s06_e01_c05_u125	Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any (sees that he's asleep) QUESTIONS!!!
s06_e01_c05_u126	(wakes up) What?!
s06_e01_c05_u127	Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
s06_e01_c05_u128	All right. All right.
s06_e01_c05_u129	Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
s06_e01_c05_u130	Really? I don't
s06_e01_c05_u131	Sing!!
s06_e01_c05_u132	(starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)
s06_e01_c05_u133	(to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)
s06_e01_c05_u134	(driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)
s06_e01_c06_u135	Hey!
s06_e01_c06_u136	Hey, hubby!
s06_e01_c06_u137	Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
s06_e01_c06_u138	Uh-huh.
s06_e01_c06_u139	I'm not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)
s06_e01_c07_u140	Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
s06_e01_c07_u141	Yes, exactly!
s06_e01_c07_u142	And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
s06_e01_c07_u143	Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
s06_e01_c07_u144	Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
s06_e01_c07_u145	I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
s06_e01_c07_u146	What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
s06_e01_c07_u147	Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
s06_e01_c07_u148	Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
s06_e01_c07_u149	I'm asking you to do me a favor.
s06_e01_c07_u150	You are asking me to be your wife!
s06_e01_c07_u151	And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
s06_e01_c08_u152	That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
s06_e01_c08_u153	Well you did pull his hair.
s06_e01_c08_u154	He took my snack!
s06_e01_c08_u155	I'm not getting into this again!
s06_e01_c08_u156	Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
s06_e01_c08_u157	Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
s06_e01_c08_u158	This doesn't mean anything, does it?
s06_e01_c08_u159	No!
s06_e01_c08_u160	Okay.
s06_e01_c09_u161	(To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker's face), a rapist or a killer or something!
s06_e01_c09_u162	Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
s06_e01_c09_u163	Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!
s06_e01_c09_u164	No!
s06_e01_c09_u165	Do you like car games?
s06_e01_c09_u166	Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
s06_e01_c09_u167	I love the license plate game!
s06_e01_c09_u168	Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
s06_e01_c09_u169	No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the partition.)
s06_e01_c10_u170	Hey!
s06_e01_c10_u171	Hey!
s06_e01_c10_u172	Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
s06_e01_c10_u173	(thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
s06_e01_c10_u174	I don't know if it's true.
s06_e01_c10_u175	Oh b-b-but it is!
s06_e01_c10_u176	Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
s06_e01_c10_u177	Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
s06_e01_c10_u178	All right. All right, I'll do it.
s06_e01_c10_u179	Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
s06_e01_c11_u180	Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
s06_e01_c11_u181	Oh, okay.
s06_e01_c11_u182	This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
s06_e01_c11_u183	And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
s06_e01_c11_u184	All right, see ya Pheebs. (Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)
s06_e01_c11_u185	Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
s06_e01_c11_u186	Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
s06_e01_c11_u187	Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
s06_e01_c11_u188	You can still sleep at night and stuff.
s06_e01_c11_u189	Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
s06_e01_c11_u190	Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
s06_e01_c11_u191	Yes.
s06_e01_c11_u192	Is it a meatball sub?
s06_e01_c11_u193	That is incredible! You are the master!
s06_e01_c12_u194	Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the
s06_e01_c12_u195	No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
s06_e01_c12_u196	All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)
s06_e01_c12_u197	All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
s06_e01_c12_u198	I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
s06_e01_c12_u199	Me too!
s06_e01_c12_u200	I don't want things to change! Do you?
s06_e01_c12_u201	No!
s06_e01_c12_u202	All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
s06_e01_c12_u203	Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)
s06_e01_c12_u204	(entering, slowly) Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
s06_e01_c12_u205	Then all your stuff would be here.
s06_e01_c12_u206	Well, what if all my stuff was here?
s06_e01_c12_u207	Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
s06_e01_c12_u208	Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
s06_e01_c12_u209	Live together? There have been no signs for that.
s06_e01_c12_u210	Me asking is kind of a sign.
s06_e01_c12_u211	YES!!!!!!!!
s06_e01_c12_u212	Okay!!!!!
s06_e01_c12_u213	Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
s06_e01_c12_u214	Okay.
s06_e01_c12_u215	Here's your key (Gets him one.)
s06_e01_c12_u216	Oh thanks.
s06_e01_c12_u217	Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!
s06_e01_c12_u218	The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!
s06_e01_c12_u219	Ready!
s06_e01_c12_u220	Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!
s06_e01_c12_u221	Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
s06_e01_c12_u222	This is not a sign!
s06_e01_c12_u223	No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!
s06_e01_c12_u224	It's an old key!
s06_e01_c12_u225	Oh my God it's old!
s06_e01_c12_u226	I love you!
s06_e01_c12_u227	I love you!
s06_e01_c12_u228	Are you hugging the door right now.
s06_e01_c12_u229	No.
s06_e01_c12_u230	Yeah-yeah, me neither.
s06_e01_c13_u231	Hey!
s06_e01_c13_u232	Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
s06_e01_c13_u233	Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
s06_e01_c13_u234	Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
s06_e01_c13_u235	Oh yeah, why not?
s06_e01_c13_u236	Pheebs?
s06_e01_c13_u237	No thanks, I've already seen one.
s06_e01_c13_u238	Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
s06_e01_c13_u239	Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
s06_e01_c13_u240	Always.
s06_e01_c13_u241	I didn't get the annulment.
s06_e01_c13_u242	What?!
s06_e01_c13_u243	We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
s06_e01_c14_u244	What are you doing?
s06_e01_c14_u245	The key's stuck in the lock.
s06_e01_c14_u246	I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)
s06_e01_c14_u247	(trying the handle) It still doesn't work.
s06_e01_c14_u248	I'm not finished.
s06_e01_c14_u249	Oh.
s06_e01_c14_u250	Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
s10_e15_c03_u001	Joey, it’s Estelle.
s10_e15_c05_u002	Sure.
s03_e06_c01_u001	Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
s03_e06_c01_u002	Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
s03_e06_c01_u003	I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
s03_e06_c01_u004	Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.
s03_e06_c01_u005	Well, that's really a different question.
s03_e06_c01_u006	I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
s03_e06_c01_u007	Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
s03_e06_c01_u008	What?!!
s03_e06_c01_u009	Excuse me, there was no time!
s03_e06_c01_u010	Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?
s03_e06_c01_u011	Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?
s03_e06_c01_u012	Does anybody need more coffee?
s03_e06_c01_u013	Yeah, I'll take some.
s03_e06_c01_u014	Hey, there's a dog out there!
s03_e06_c02_u015	Oh, that is so unfortunate.
s03_e06_c02_u016	What?
s03_e06_c02_u017	Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
s03_e06_c02_u018	(entering from bedroom) Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
s03_e06_c02_u019	You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
s03_e06_c02_u020	Oh, then it must've been you. Bye. (leaves)
s03_e06_c02_u021	(angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That's why I moved out.
s03_e06_c02_u022	Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.
s03_e06_c02_u023	I think on some levels she already knows.
s03_e06_c02_u024	Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now.
s03_e06_c02_u025	Okay, well maybe not on those levels.
s03_e06_c02_u026	(entering, with a goatee) Hey.
s03_e06_c02_u027	Hey.
s03_e06_c02_u028	I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever.
s03_e06_c02_u029	Why, nobody good?
s03_e06_c02_u030	Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
s03_e06_c02_u031	So how many more do you have tomorrow?
s03_e06_c02_u032	Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing,' he said Whoa-whoa, short message.'
s03_e06_c02_u033	(entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the floor or come over no more!
s03_e06_c02_u034	(to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
s03_e06_c02_u035	What?
s03_e06_c02_u036	I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...
s03_e06_c02_u037	Umm, how's it going with you guys?
s03_e06_c02_u038	Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
s03_e06_c02_u039	Oh, really?
s03_e06_c02_u040	Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
s03_e06_c03_u041	Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
s03_e06_c03_u042	Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool.
s03_e06_c03_u043	Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
s03_e06_c03_u044	Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star. (Chandler breaks his pencil in half)
s03_e06_c03_u045	Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. (Eric offers to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)
s03_e06_c04_u046	(running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door) Bye-bye.
s03_e06_c04_u047	Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?
s03_e06_c04_u048	Sure. Ummm. What's up?
s03_e06_c04_u049	Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
s03_e06_c04_u050	What gay thing?
s03_e06_c04_u051	Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that.
s03_e06_c05_u052	Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.
s03_e06_c05_u053	Hi.
s03_e06_c05_u054	Hey!
s03_e06_c06_u055	Hey, Mon.
s03_e06_c06_u056	Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
s03_e06_c06_u057	Do I ever.
s03_e06_c06_u058	Chris says they're closing down the bar.
s03_e06_c06_u059	No way!
s03_e06_c06_u060	Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place.
s03_e06_c06_u061	Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
s03_e06_c06_u062	Got me.
s03_e06_c06_u063	(to bartender) Can I get a beer.
s03_e06_c06_u064	Hey, did you pick a roommate?
s03_e06_c06_u065	You betcha!
s03_e06_c06_u066	Is it the Italian guy?
s03_e06_c06_u067	Um-mm, yeah right!
s03_e06_c06_u068	He's so cute.
s03_e06_c06_u069	Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
s03_e06_c06_u070	Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
s03_e06_c06_u071	Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool.
s03_e06_c06_u072	(sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is.
s03_e06_c06_u073	I am so sorry.
s03_e06_c06_u074	That's all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
s03_e06_c06_u075	Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber DDS
s03_e06_c06_u076	Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out and they all scream)
s03_e06_c06_u077	Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life.
s03_e06_c06_u078	Yeah, I know.
s03_e06_c06_u079	What?
s03_e06_c06_u080	Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)
s03_e06_c06_u081	Rachel stop!
s03_e06_c06_u082	You're so bad!
s03_e06_c06_u083	I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.
s03_e06_c06_u084	Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.
s03_e06_c06_u085	Yeah, so?
s03_e06_c06_u086	(picks it up) And now I've picked it up again. (walks over to Monica.)
s03_e06_c06_u087	Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!
s03_e06_c06_u088	Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)
s03_e06_c06_u089	Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
s03_e06_c06_u090	Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much.
s03_e06_c06_u091	Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations
s03_e06_c06_u092	Thank you. So how-how bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
s03_e06_c06_u093	Aww, not right now.
s03_e06_c06_u094	Oh, but that's okay.
s03_e06_c06_u095	I know.
s03_e06_c06_u096	Yeah.
s03_e06_c06_u097	So, I'll get-get back to my friend.
s03_e06_c06_u098	Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the cue ball as a Remember me?' thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
s03_e06_c06_u099	Oh, that'd be great.
s03_e06_c06_u100	Okay!
s03_e06_c06_u101	Thanks.
s03_e06_c06_u102	Bye!
s03_e06_c06_u103	Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.
s03_e06_c07_u104	No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye
s03_e06_c07_u105	So what are they doing?
s03_e06_c07_u106	I don't know, something girlie.
s03_e06_c07_u107	(to Monica, who's entering) Hey, you're early.
s03_e06_c07_u108	What are you doing with the lamp?
s03_e06_c07_u109	I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
s03_e06_c07_u110	Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause they've had that thing for over a week.
s03_e06_c07_u111	No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
s03_e06_c07_u112	You're disturbing my oboe practice.
s03_e06_c07_u113	You don't play the oboe!
s03_e06_c07_u114	I could play the oboe!
s03_e06_c07_u115	Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in his face.)
s03_e06_c07_u116	(to Eric) Who are you?
s03_e06_c07_u117	Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate.
s03_e06_c07_u118	I'm Chandler's new roommate.
s03_e06_c07_u119	I-I-I don't think so.
s03_e06_c07_u120	I could be Chandler's new roommate.
s03_e06_c07_u121	But, he told me over the phone.
s03_e06_c07_u122	He told me in person.
s03_e06_c07_u123	That's weird.
s03_e06_c07_u124	Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. (goes over to the door and opens it) Ehh! (Eric leaves)
s03_e06_c08_u125	Hi, again.
s03_e06_c08_u126	Hey! (goes into the apartment)
s03_e06_c08_u127	(leaving to go to work) Hey!
s03_e06_c08_u128	Thank you soo, much.
s03_e06_c08_u129	Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
s03_e06_c08_u130	You want some help with that?
s03_e06_c08_u131	Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don't!
s03_e06_c08_u132	Whoa! Are you okay?
s03_e06_c08_u133	Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
s03_e06_c08_u134	It's the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away) And-and the humidity.
s03_e06_c08_u135	That's a uh, that's a tough combination.
s03_e06_c08_u136	Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
s03_e06_c08_u137	Like you wouldn't believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is a great place.
s03_e06_c08_u138	Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
s03_e06_c08_u139	Gotcha.
s03_e06_c08_u140	This place is really my Grandmother's. (Joey starts to take off all of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
s03_e06_c08_u141	Oh, you bet I am!
s03_e06_c08_u142	(turning around) Okay, here's your penis!
s03_e06_c09_u143	Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
s03_e06_c09_u144	You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
s03_e06_c09_u145	So?!
s03_e06_c09_u146	Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?
s03_e06_c09_u147	Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
s03_e06_c09_u148	Oh right, right.
s03_e06_c09_u149	I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
s03_e06_c09_u150	Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk.
s03_e06_c09_u151	It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
s03_e06_c10_u152	Pheebs?
s03_e06_c10_u153	Huh?
s03_e06_c10_u154	Where's your bed?
s03_e06_c10_u155	It's not in the apartment? (Monica gives a Come on' look) Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
s03_e06_c10_u156	What?
s03_e06_c10_u157	Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore.
s03_e06_c10_u158	What are you talking about?
s03_e06_c10_u159	I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
s03_e06_c10_u160	Everybody knows!
s03_e06_c10_u161	That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
s03_e06_c10_u162	Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
s03_e06_c10_u163	Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
s03_e06_c10_u164	What?!?!
s03_e06_c10_u165	Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
s03_e06_c10_u166	You can spill. In the sink.
s03_e06_c10_u167	Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening.
s03_e06_c10_u168	I love you, too.
s03_e06_c10_u169	Aww, good. (they hug) What?
s03_e06_c10_u170	What? I'm just said.
s03_e06_c10_u171	No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is.
s03_e06_c11_u172	So ah, whatcha watching?
s03_e06_c11_u173	Baywatch.
s03_e06_c11_u174	What's it about?
s03_e06_c11_u175	Lifeguards.
s03_e06_c11_u176	Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who's she?
s03_e06_c11_u177	Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
s03_e06_c11_u178	Wow! Look at them run.
s03_e06_c11_u179	They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
s03_e06_c11_u180	Yeah, I'll go get one.
s03_e06_c11_u181	No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here.
s03_e06_c12_u182	Well, hello!
s03_e06_c12_u183	Hey.
s03_e06_c12_u184	Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
s03_e06_c12_u185	(all depressed) Help yourself.
s03_e06_c12_u186	You okay?
s03_e06_c12_u187	Phoebe moved out.
s03_e06_c12_u188	Right.
s03_e06_c12_u189	I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
s03_e06_c12_u190	Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
s03_e06_c12_u191	Well, I think so.
s03_e06_c12_u192	Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
s03_e06_c13_u193	(all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?
s03_e06_c13_u194	Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
s03_e06_c13_u195	My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
s03_e06_c13_u196	Oh no! Why?
s03_e06_c13_u197	Cause Carol's a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
s03_e06_c13_u198	Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
s03_e06_c13_u199	(sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many drinks) I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!
s03_e06_c13_u200	Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
s03_e06_c13_u201	Well, now I do!!
s03_e06_c13_u202	I'm sorry.
s03_e06_c13_u203	Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever....
s03_e06_c13_u204	Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)
s03_e06_c14_u205	Umm, this is nice.
s03_e06_c14_u206	I know, it is isn't it?
s03_e06_c14_u207	No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
s03_e06_c14_u208	Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
s03_e06_c14_u209	Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
s03_e06_c14_u210	Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
s03_e06_c14_u211	Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be....
s03_e06_c14_u212	I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)
s03_e06_c15_u213	Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!
s03_e06_c15_u214	I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good. (kisses him on the cheek)
s03_e06_c15_u215	Thanks.
s03_e06_c15_u216	And you're so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And you're kind (kisses him on the lips)
s03_e06_c15_u217	Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
s03_e06_c15_u218	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
s03_e06_c15_u219	Huh?
s03_e06_c15_u220	Okay, it's okay.
s03_e06_c15_u221	Oh. (they start kissing again)
s03_e06_c15_u222	Wait, wait, wait.
s03_e06_c15_u223	What?
s03_e06_c15_u224	My foot is stuck in the pocket.
s03_e06_c15_u225	What?
s03_e06_c15_u226	No, I can't get it out.
s03_e06_c15_u227	Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear.
s03_e06_c15_u228	No, come on don't start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!
s03_e06_c15_u229	What?
s03_e06_c15_u230	Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
s03_e06_c15_u231	Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
s03_e06_c15_u232	You have chalk on your face.
s03_e06_c15_u233	Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
s03_e06_c15_u234	Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
s03_e06_c15_u235	Hey, are you okay?
s03_e06_c15_u236	My wife's a lesbian.
s03_e06_c15_u237	Cool!!
s03_e06_c15_u238	Hi.
s03_e06_c16_u239	I can't believe you came back.
s03_e06_c16_u240	Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
s03_e06_c16_u241	Rachel! Rachel! (stirs Rachel from her dream, she's in her car driving back from the city)
s03_e06_c16_u242	What?
s03_e06_c16_u243	You missed the exit!
s03_e06_c16_u244	Oh, sorry.
s03_e06_c16_u245	My God, what were you thinking about?
s03_e06_c16_u246	Um, (shyly) Barry.
s03_e06_c16_u247	Awwww!!
s05_e15_c01_u001	Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
s05_e15_c01_u002	(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
s05_e15_c01_u003	What are you doing?!
s05_e15_c01_u004	Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
s05_e15_c01_u005	Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?
s05_e15_c01_u006	What the hell are doing?!!
s05_e15_c01_u007	(running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!
s05_e15_c01_u008	Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
s05_e15_c01_u009	(panicking) Dude! He's right there!
s05_e15_c01_u010	(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
s05_e15_c01_u011	Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
s05_e15_c01_u012	I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.
s05_e15_c01_u013	(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!
s05_e15_c01_u014	Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
s05_e15_c01_u015	What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the door.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
s05_e15_c01_u016	Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
s05_e15_c01_u017	(happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? (He hugs them both.)
s05_e15_c01_u018	Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.) Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
s05_e15_c02_u019	Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids
s05_e15_c02_u020	(interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
s05_e15_c02_u021	(quickly) I call Godfather!
s05_e15_c02_u022	You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
s05_e15_c02_u023	Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
s05_e15_c02_u024	Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
s05_e15_c02_u025	Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
s05_e15_c02_u026	Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
s05_e15_c02_u027	Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
s05_e15_c02_u028	Okay.
s05_e15_c02_u029	(to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
s05_e15_c02_u030	Hi!
s05_e15_c02_u031	Hi!
s05_e15_c02_u032	So, are you ready to go?
s05_e15_c02_u033	Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
s05_e15_c02_u034	Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)
s05_e15_c02_u035	Hey, where are we going to lunch?
s05_e15_c02_u036	I was thinking Chinese food.
s05_e15_c02_u037	Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?! (She hits him repeatedly as she says that.)
s05_e15_c02_u038	She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
s05_e15_c02_u039	I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but
s05_e15_c02_u040	But what?
s05_e15_c02_u041	(shyly) She keeps punching me.
s05_e15_c02_u042	In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
s05_e15_c02_u043	Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's hurting me.
s05_e15_c02_u044	I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
s05_e15_c02_u045	Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
s05_e15_c02_u046	Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
s05_e15_c03_u047	(opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!
s05_e15_c03_u048	Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
s05_e15_c03_u049	Aww.
s05_e15_c03_u050	Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
s05_e15_c03_u051	Huh.
s05_e15_c03_u052	Bread, so you never go hungry.
s05_e15_c03_u053	Ohh.
s05_e15_c03_u054	And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
s05_e15_c03_u055	Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
s05_e15_c03_u056	Yeah!
s05_e15_c03_u057	Hi!
s05_e15_c03_u058	Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
s05_e15_c03_u059	Oh hi Phoebe.
s05_e15_c03_u060	Mr. President.
s05_e15_c03_u061	I came to talk to you about Howard.
s05_e15_c03_u062	Howard?
s05_e15_c03_u063	Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
s05_e15_c03_u064	Oh that's nice.
s05_e15_c03_u065	Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or
s05_e15_c03_u066	Oh. Uhh
s05_e15_c03_u067	Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door. (Points to his apartment across the hall.)
s05_e15_c03_u068	No-no, it's not that, it's just- I-I just moved in.
s05_e15_c03_u069	Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
s05_e15_c03_u070	Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
s05_e15_c03_u071	Oh, okay, I get it. (Starts to leave.)
s05_e15_c03_u072	No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
s05_e15_c03_u073	Howard's the handy man!
s05_e15_c03_u074	Yes but too me he's just, man.
s05_e15_c03_u075	Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building. (Exits.)
s05_e15_c03_u076	(To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!
s05_e15_c03_u077	Yeah. I really like his glasses.
s05_e15_c04_u078	so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
s05_e15_c04_u079	(To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
s05_e15_c04_u080	Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
s05_e15_c04_u081	It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
s05_e15_c04_u082	Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
s05_e15_c04_u083	Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)
s05_e15_c04_u084	And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
s05_e15_c04_u085	Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
s05_e15_c04_u086	Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
s05_e15_c04_u087	Wh-wh-why?!
s05_e15_c04_u088	Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
s05_e15_c04_u089	Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
s05_e15_c04_u090	Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
s05_e15_c04_u091	I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
s05_e15_c04_u092	No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
s05_e15_c04_u093	Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
s05_e15_c04_u094	Not unless different means the same.
s05_e15_c05_u095	You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! (She slaps her thighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)
s05_e15_c05_u096	(sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
s05_e15_c05_u097	No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again and he retreats to the arm of the couch.)
s05_e15_c05_u098	Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
s05_e15_c05_u099	Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the couch.)
s05_e15_c06_u100	Isn't this great?
s05_e15_c06_u101	Hmm.
s05_e15_c06_u102	Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.) Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
s05_e15_c06_u103	Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)
s05_e15_c06_u104	Are you okay?
s05_e15_c06_u105	Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
s05_e15_c06_u106	What-what are you doing?
s05_e15_c06_u107	I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
s05_e15_c06_u108	Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
s05_e15_c06_u109	What?!
s05_e15_c06_u110	Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
s05_e15_c06_u111	Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
s05_e15_c06_u112	Oh and you know what I want!
s05_e15_c06_u113	Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
s05_e15_c06_u114	I do not have baby fever!
s05_e15_c06_u115	Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
s05_e15_c06_u116	Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
s05_e15_c06_u117	Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
s05_e15_c06_u118	You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)
s05_e15_c06_u119	Well, I did not know that.
s05_e15_c07_u120	It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
s05_e15_c07_u121	By me?
s05_e15_c07_u122	Oh, no!
s05_e15_c07_u123	No-no.
s05_e15_c07_u124	Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
s05_e15_c07_u125	Yeah, big!
s05_e15_c07_u126	Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
s05_e15_c07_u127	Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?
s05_e15_c07_u128	Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
s05_e15_c07_u129	I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
s05_e15_c07_u130	Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
s05_e15_c07_u131	What?!
s05_e15_c07_u132	Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
s05_e15_c07_u133	Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)
s05_e15_c08_u134	Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)
s05_e15_c08_u135	Oh, hi Ross!
s05_e15_c08_u136	What are you doing?
s05_e15_c08_u137	Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)
s05_e15_c08_u138	See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!
s05_e15_c08_u139	You chipped in?!
s05_e15_c08_u140	Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
s05_e15_c08_u141	Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
s05_e15_c08_u142	Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
s05_e15_c08_u143	Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
s05_e15_c08_u144	No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
s05_e15_c08_u145	(walking up) Oh hey, Pheebs!
s05_e15_c08_u146	Hey!
s05_e15_c08_u147	Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about. (Walks away.)
s05_e15_c08_u148	Yeah, okay, my bad.
s05_e15_c09_u149	Hey!
s05_e15_c09_u150	Hi! Wow! You look, you look-big.
s05_e15_c09_u151	Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
s05_e15_c09_u152	Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
s05_e15_c09_u153	Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
s05_e15_c09_u154	(entering) Hi!
s05_e15_c09_u155	Hey! Hiya!
s05_e15_c09_u156	Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
s05_e15_c09_u157	Oh, thanks! That's so sweet! (She punches Rachel like she punched Joey.)
s05_e15_c09_u158	Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, "You see what I mean?!")
s05_e15_c09_u159	Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys, (Punches Joey) are too much! (Punches Rachel.)
s05_e15_c09_u160	Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)
s05_e15_c09_u161	Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends! (She punches Rachel.)
s05_e15_c09_u162	Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)
s05_e15_c09_u163	You're so sweet! (Punches Rachel yet again.)
s05_e15_c09_u164	Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)
s05_e15_c09_u165	Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
s05_e15_c09_u166	Huh.
s05_e15_c09_u167	Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
s05_e15_c09_u168	Uhh-.
s05_e15_c09_u169	You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
s05_e15_c09_u170	Nah.
s05_e15_c10_u171	(trying to get her attention) Phoebe?
s05_e15_c10_u172	(ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying. (Laughs.)
s05_e15_c10_u173	(tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?
s05_e15_c10_u174	Ooh. (Turns to him.)
s05_e15_c10_u175	Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
s05_e15_c10_u176	No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
s05_e15_c10_u177	So uh, what did you tell them about me?
s05_e15_c10_u178	Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
s05_e15_c10_u179	Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)
s05_e15_c10_u180	But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
s05_e15_c10_u181	What?!
s05_e15_c10_u182	Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
s05_e15_c10_u183	(trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!
s05_e15_c10_u184	Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
s05_e15_c10_u185	(sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross tries dumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a think like that?
s05_e15_c10_u186	3-B!
s05_e15_c10_u187	Oh yeah, aww!
s05_e15_c10_u188	Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
s05_e15_c10_u189	Yeah, leave!
s05_e15_c10_u190	Yeah, get out! Now!
s05_e15_c10_u191	Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
s05_e15_c10_u192	All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
s05_e15_c11_u193	Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
s05_e15_c11_u194	Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
s05_e15_c12_u195	Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
s05_e15_c12_u196	(raising her hand) I'm Monica.
s05_e15_c12_u197	I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
s05_e15_c12_u198	Okay.
s05_e15_c12_u199	Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
s05_e15_c12_u200	Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
s05_e15_c12_u201	(getting out a ring box) Monica
s05_e15_c12_u202	No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
s05_e15_c12_u203	Will you marry me?
s05_e15_c12_u204	Oh-no. No. No.
s05_e15_c12_u205	What a bad idea!
s05_e15_c12_u206	Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)
s05_e15_c12_u207	Chandler, why are you doing this?
s05_e15_c12_u208	I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
s05_e15_c12_u209	Chandler.
s05_e15_c12_u210	I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
s05_e15_c12_u211	Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
s05_e15_c12_u212	No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?
s05_e15_c12_u213	(kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
s05_e15_c12_u214	Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
s05_e15_c12_u215	Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
s05_e15_c12_u216	Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
s05_e15_c12_u217	Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
s05_e15_c12_u218	Hey!
s05_e15_c12_u219	She's right y'know.
s05_e15_c12_u220	Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
s05_e15_c12_u221	Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
s05_e15_c12_u222	I didn't think I was!
s05_e15_c12_u223	Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
s05_e15_c12_u224	Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)
s05_e15_c13_u225	Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?
s05_e15_c13_u226	No, I will not!
s05_e15_c13_u227	Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
s05_e15_c13_u228	You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
s05_e15_c13_u229	Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
s05_e15_c13_u230	Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
s05_e15_c13_u231	Okay, how long is this going to go on.
s05_e15_c13_u232	Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
s05_e15_c13_u233	This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)
s05_e15_c13_u234	That's not funny.
s05_e15_c13_u235	That's not funny at all!
s06_e02_c01_u001	Hey!
s06_e02_c01_u002	Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
s06_e02_c01_u003	Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
s06_e02_c01_u004	Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
s06_e02_c01_u005	Oh yeah, why not?
s06_e02_c01_u006	Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)
s06_e02_c01_u007	Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
s06_e02_c01_u008	Always.
s06_e02_c01_u009	I didn't get the annulment.
s06_e02_c01_u010	What?!
s06_e02_c01_u011	We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)
s06_e02_c01_u012	(To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?
s06_e02_c01_u013	Oh? Yeah! Sure!
s06_e02_c01_u014	(running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
s06_e02_c01_u015	Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
s06_e02_c01_u016	Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.) Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.)
s06_e02_c01_u017	Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
s06_e02_c01_u018	Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab's roof and it pulls away.) (To Ross) You didn't get the annulment?!!
s06_e02_c01_u019	I know.
s06_e02_c01_u020	Ross?!
s06_e02_c01_u021	Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
s06_e02_c01_u022	Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
s06_e02_c01_u023	Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
s06_e02_c01_u024	So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
s06_e02_c01_u025	Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
s06_e02_c01_u026	Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
s06_e02_c01_u027	(to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
s06_e02_c01_u028	Hey Rach!
s06_e02_c01_u029	What was that?!
s06_e02_c01_u030	Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
s06_e02_c01_u031	I haven't seen it yet!
s06_e02_c01_u032	Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the roof again and off they go.)
s06_e02_c01_u033	Noooooooo!!
s06_e02_c02_u034	Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
s06_e02_c02_u035	Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
s06_e02_c02_u036	No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
s06_e02_c02_u037	Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
s06_e02_c02_u038	No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too-" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "-go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
s06_e02_c02_u039	Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I- We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
s06_e02_c02_u040	Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
s06_e02_c02_u041	Pretty much.
s06_e02_c02_u042	All right.
s06_e02_c02_u043	(entering) Hey Monica!
s06_e02_c02_u044	Hi!
s06_e02_c02_u045	(To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)
s06_e02_c02_u046	Joey, we have something to tell you.
s06_e02_c02_u047	Oh my God! You're pregnant!
s06_e02_c02_u048	No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
s06_e02_c02_u049	Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh- Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the verge of tears as Monica stops him.)
s06_e02_c02_u050	Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
s06_e02_c02_u051	Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
s06_e02_c02_u052	Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
s06_e02_c02_u053	(To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm- Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)
s06_e02_c03_u054	Hey Pheebs!
s06_e02_c03_u055	Hey!
s06_e02_c03_u056	Hey, have you seen Rachel?
s06_e02_c03_u057	No, why?
s06_e02_c03_u058	I have some pretty exciting news!
s06_e02_c03_u059	(gasps) You're pregnant!
s06_e02_c03_u060	No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
s06_e02_c03_u061	Ooh! That's good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.
s06_e02_c03_u062	Hey! Hi!
s06_e02_c03_u063	Hey!
s06_e02_c03_u064	What's up?
s06_e02_c03_u065	Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
s06_e02_c03_u066	Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend-shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great. (Kisses and hugs her.)
s06_e02_c03_u067	Guys, I'm happy too.
s06_e02_c03_u068	Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)
s06_e02_c03_u069	Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled- (Winks at Ross.)
s06_e02_c03_u070	Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad? (Exits.)
s06_e02_c03_u071	Bye.
s06_e02_c03_u072	Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel- Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
s06_e02_c03_u073	Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
s06_e02_c03_u074	Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates
s06_e02_c03_u075	(interrupting) No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
s06_e02_c03_u076	Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
s06_e02_c03_u077	Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
s06_e02_c03_u078	Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
s06_e02_c03_u079	What?! Why?
s06_e02_c03_u080	(to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
s06_e02_c03_u081	And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
s06_e02_c04_u082	(entering) Hey!
s06_e02_c04_u083	Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
s06_e02_c04_u084	(looking down) What gave me away?
s06_e02_c04_u085	I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
s06_e02_c04_u086	Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
s06_e02_c04_u087	No.
s06_e02_c04_u088	Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
s06_e02_c04_u089	Hey!
s06_e02_c04_u090	Hey.
s06_e02_c04_u091	Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
s06_e02_c04_u092	Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
s06_e02_c04_u093	I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
s06_e02_c04_u094	Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty
s06_e02_c04_u095	What?
s06_e02_c04_u096	(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
s06_e02_c04_u097	Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
s06_e02_c04_u098	Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
s06_e02_c04_u099	Really?!
s06_e02_c04_u100	And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
s06_e02_c04_u101	Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct her.)
s06_e02_c04_u102	And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
s06_e02_c04_u103	Rach
s06_e02_c04_u104	Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
s06_e02_c04_u105	Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God- (Gasps and starts to sing) Come and knock on my door
s06_e02_c04_u106	(singing) We'll be waiting for you
s06_e02_c05_u107	once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
s06_e02_c05_u108	Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
s06_e02_c05_u109	Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
s06_e02_c05_u110	Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn't you want a date?
s06_e02_c05_u111	Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out
s06_e02_c05_u112	(interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?
s06_e02_c05_u113	Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
s06_e02_c05_u114	What?!
s06_e02_c05_u115	(leaning to him) She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)
s06_e02_c05_u116	This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
s06_e02_c05_u117	Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
s06_e02_c05_u118	We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
s06_e02_c05_u119	Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
s06_e02_c05_u120	(to the panel) Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
s06_e02_c05_u121	Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
s06_e02_c05_u122	(getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth-(leans down to Meg's ear)-Nothing!!
s06_e02_c05_u123	Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
s06_e02_c05_u124	I am so attracted to him right now.
s06_e02_c06_u125	Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
s06_e02_c06_u126	Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
s06_e02_c06_u127	Well, Joey's my best friend.
s06_e02_c06_u128	I'm not your best friend?
s06_e02_c06_u129	You just said- Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
s06_e02_c06_u130	All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
s06_e02_c06_u131	Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)
s06_e02_c06_u132	(slapping his hand) Hey!
s06_e02_c06_u133	Hey-hey!
s06_e02_c06_u134	These aren't for you! Are you upset?
s06_e02_c06_u135	I am now!
s06_e02_c06_u136	(entering) Hey roomie!
s06_e02_c06_u137	Okay, bye! (Exits.)
s06_e02_c06_u138	Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
s06_e02_c06_u139	(gasps) Are you pregnant?!
s06_e02_c06_u140	No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
s06_e02_c06_u141	Um-hmm.
s06_e02_c06_u142	Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
s06_e02_c06_u143	(laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
s06_e02_c06_u144	Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
s06_e02_c06_u145	Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)
s06_e02_c06_u146	Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
s06_e02_c06_u147	Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
s06_e02_c06_u148	Maybe, do you need a tissue?
s06_e02_c06_u149	Monica, where did you get these?!
s06_e02_c06_u150	I made them!
s06_e02_c06_u151	Ooh, good God, they're so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
s06_e02_c07_u152	God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
s06_e02_c07_u153	Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
s06_e02_c07_u154	Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
s06_e02_c07_u155	Not once did we do that.
s06_e02_c07_u156	(entering) Hi.
s06_e02_c07_u157	Hey!
s06_e02_c07_u158	Hi.
s06_e02_c07_u159	So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
s06_e02_c07_u160	Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
s06_e02_c07_u161	Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)
s06_e02_c07_u162	And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
s06_e02_c07_u163	I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
s06_e02_c07_u164	Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
s06_e02_c07_u165	Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
s06_e02_c08_u166	You got married again.
s06_e02_c08_u167	Yes.
s06_e02_c08_u168	So that's your second marriage in two years.
s06_e02_c08_u169	Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
s06_e02_c08_u170	Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
s06_e02_c08_u171	Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
s06_e02_c08_u172	(interrupting) I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
s06_e02_c08_u173	Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
s06_e02_c08_u174	Oh, that's better then.
s06_e02_c08_u175	This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
s06_e02_c08_u176	I see. Have you considered therapy?
s06_e02_c08_u177	I think just the annulment for today.
s06_e02_c08_u178	There are a couple of forms to fill out.
s06_e02_c08_u179	Easy.
s06_e02_c08_u180	And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
s06_e02_c08_u181	No problem.
s06_e02_c08_u182	And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
s06_e02_c08_u183	Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
s06_e02_c08_u184	Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
s06_e02_c08_u185	Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.
s06_e02_c09_u186	Hey!
s06_e02_c09_u187	Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
s06_e02_c09_u188	Okay!
s06_e02_c09_u189	Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
s06_e02_c09_u190	Okay.
s06_e02_c09_u191	Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
s06_e02_c09_u192	(grabbing the star) What the hell is that?
s06_e02_c09_u193	I don't know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
s06_e02_c09_u194	Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
s06_e02_c09_u195	Something to remember me by!
s06_e02_c09_u196	Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
s06_e02_c09_u197	But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
s06_e02_c09_u198	Are you okay? You're not blinking.
s06_e02_c09_u199	I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
s06_e02_c09_u200	Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
s06_e02_c09_u201	An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
s06_e02_c09_u202	What is the matter with you?!
s06_e02_c09_u203	What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
s06_e02_c09_u204	All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
s06_e02_c09_u205	What's hard to believe?
s06_e02_c09_u206	Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
s06_e02_c09_u207	Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
s06_e02_c09_u208	But I
s06_e02_c09_u209	No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
s06_e02_c09_u210	It is? Really?
s06_e02_c09_u211	Yeah, sweetie.
s06_e02_c09_u212	(starting to lose her composure) I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
s06_e02_c09_u213	No.
s06_e02_c09_u214	What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)
s06_e02_c09_u215	I'm gonna miss you! (They hug.)
s06_e02_c09_u216	I mean it's the end of an era!
s06_e02_c09_u217	I know!
s06_e02_c10_u218	(to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!
s06_e02_c10_u219	Oh no.
s06_e02_c10_u220	So? Did you get the annulment?
s06_e02_c10_u221	I couldn't.
s06_e02_c10_u222	I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
s06_e02_c10_u223	It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I
s06_e02_c10_u224	Yeah, complicated cause of the love.
s06_e02_c10_u225	I- I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
s06_e02_c10_u226	I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
s06_e02_c10_u227	I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
s06_e02_c10_u228	Ohh, what's wrong?!
s06_e02_c10_u229	Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
s06_e02_c10_u230	Oh my-Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
s06_e02_c10_u231	Thank you.
s06_e02_c10_u232	Of course.
s06_e02_c11_u233	So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
s06_e02_c11_u234	Oh we do, but not just yet.
s06_e02_c11_u235	Really?! Well, when?
s06_e02_c11_u236	Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
s06_e02_c11_u237	Wow.
s06_e02_c11_u238	I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
s06_e02_c11_u239	Great!
s06_e02_c11_u240	But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
s06_e02_c11_u241	Oh-oh, what about Ross?
s06_e02_c11_u242	I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
s07_e05_c01_u001	Hey.
s07_e05_c01_u002	What's the matter?
s07_e05_c01_u003	Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
s07_e05_c01_u004	Oh Willie's still alive!
s07_e05_c01_u005	What are you guys doing?
s07_e05_c01_u006	Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
s07_e05_c01_u007	Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
s07_e05_c01_u008	That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
s07_e05_c01_u009	No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this- (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth, this shall be known as The Face.)
s07_e05_c01_u010	Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
s07_e05_c01_u011	I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
s07_e05_c01_u012	(looking at one) Oh, here's a great one.
s07_e05_c01_u013	Yeah, I'm not in that.
s07_e05_c01_u014	I know, but look at me all tan.
s07_e05_c01_u015	Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
s07_e05_c01_u016	That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know- (Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)
s07_e05_c01_u017	Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
s07_e05_c01_u018	Chandler what do you say?
s07_e05_c01_u019	All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going. (Does The Face while saying that last part.)
s07_e05_c02_u020	(To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh
s07_e05_c02_u021	How about those three pointers?
s07_e05_c02_u022	Amazing!
s07_e05_c02_u023	And those guys were this (Doing the standard "This Close" gesture) close to lettin' us play this time too.
s07_e05_c02_u024	Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
s07_e05_c02_u025	Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
s07_e05_c02_u026	Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
s07_e05_c02_u027	(returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
s07_e05_c02_u028	Hey, I thought that guy was married.
s07_e05_c02_u029	He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
s07_e05_c02_u030	It's not a club.
s07_e05_c02_u031	Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
s07_e05_c02_u032	Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
s07_e05_c02_u033	They have that on the napkins at the club.
s07_e05_c02_u034	Oh, I gotta get back to work.
s07_e05_c02_u035	You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
s07_e05_c02_u036	Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
s07_e05_c02_u037	Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
s07_e05_c02_u038	Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
s07_e05_c02_u039	Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
s07_e05_c02_u040	I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
s07_e05_c02_u041	So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
s07_e05_c02_u042	Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
s07_e05_c02_u043	Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
s07_e05_c02_u044	Dude that is so sad.
s07_e05_c02_u045	I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
s07_e05_c02_u046	Could I play?
s07_e05_c03_u047	Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
s07_e05_c03_u048	I just did them.
s07_e05_c03_u049	Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
s07_e05_c03_u050	What?
s07_e05_c03_u051	Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
s07_e05_c03_u052	Yeah, I filled them out last night?
s07_e05_c03_u053	Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
s07_e05_c03_u054	Hey Rachel!
s07_e05_c03_u055	(startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up? (She has put on the backpack.)
s07_e05_c03_u056	Umm, is Tag here?
s07_e05_c03_u057	No. Why?
s07_e05_c03_u058	Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
s07_e05_c03_u059	Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
s07_e05_c03_u060	Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
s07_e05_c03_u061	Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
s07_e05_c03_u062	Oh no!
s07_e05_c03_u063	Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
s07_e05_c03_u064	Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
s07_e05_c03_u065	Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
s07_e05_c04_u066	(taking pictures) Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
s07_e05_c04_u067	Okay. (Does The Face.)
s07_e05_c04_u068	I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
s07_e05_c04_u069	No, I am.
s07_e05_c04_u070	Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
s07_e05_c04_u071	I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)
s07_e05_c04_u072	Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
s07_e05_c04_u073	Okay. (You'll have to see it, I can't describe the face he makes, but it isn't good.)
s07_e05_c04_u074	Or not.
s07_e05_c05_u075	Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
s07_e05_c05_u076	Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. (Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got an extra one?
s07_e05_c05_u077	Yeah, sure. Umm-here. (Hands him one.)
s07_e05_c05_u078	Great. (He doesn't like it.) You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
s07_e05_c05_u079	Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
s07_e05_c05_u080	All right, I guess this will be fine.
s07_e05_c05_u081	Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
s07_e05_c05_u082	Nothing, why?
s07_e05_c05_u083	How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
s07_e05_c05_u084	Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
s07_e05_c05_u085	I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
s07_e05_c05_u086	Really? Cause I could kinda use the money.
s07_e05_c05_u087	Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
s07_e05_c05_u088	Yeah, okay.
s07_e05_c05_u089	Yeah?
s07_e05_c05_u090	Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) Ooh-Hey, donuts!
s07_e05_c05_u091	Yeah!
s07_e05_c05_u092	Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all over himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)
s07_e05_c06_u093	I know. Let's try a look-of far off-wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" (The photographer laughs.) Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
s07_e05_c06_u094	Aww! (Smiles.)
s07_e05_c06_u095	That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
s07_e05_c07_u096	I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
s07_e05_c07_u097	They can't all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
s07_e05_c07_u098	Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
s07_e05_c07_u099	Do you really want to pull at that thread?
s07_e05_c07_u100	I'm having a really good time!
s07_e05_c07_u101	Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
s07_e05_c07_u102	Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
s07_e05_c07_u103	Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
s07_e05_c07_u104	Yeah, I- Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
s07_e05_c07_u105	I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
s07_e05_c07_u106	Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
s07_e05_c07_u107	No it's- Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
s07_e05_c07_u108	Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?
s07_e05_c07_u109	Yeah?
s07_e05_c07_u110	Yeah, umm that's Whitney (Points), Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
s07_e05_c07_u111	What?! No!
s07_e05_c07_u112	Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)
s07_e05_c07_u113	Look, I don't think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)
s07_e05_c08_u114	Hi Ginger.
s07_e05_c08_u115	All right! I want my key back!
s07_e05_c08_u116	I don't have it!
s07_e05_c08_u117	It's right there! (Points to her hand.)
s07_e05_c08_u118	Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)
s07_e05_c08_u119	Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
s07_e05_c08_u120	All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
s07_e05_c08_u121	Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
s07_e05_c08_u122	Okay.
s07_e05_c08_u123	Hi Whitney.
s07_e05_c08_u124	Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
s07_e05_c08_u125	Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.
s07_e05_c08_u126	(To Ross) Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
s07_e05_c08_u127	(opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
s07_e05_c08_u128	Sure.
s07_e05_c08_u129	Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
s07_e05_c08_u130	Watching ballroom dancing?
s07_e05_c08_u131	Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
s07_e05_c08_u132	Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
s07_e05_c08_u133	Like what?
s07_e05_c08_u134	Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
s07_e05_c08_u135	Okay.
s07_e05_c08_u136	And! She uses sex as a weapon!
s07_e05_c08_u137	Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
s07_e05_c08_u138	You're still gonna go out with her?!
s07_e05_c08_u139	Yeah!
s07_e05_c08_u140	Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
s07_e05_c08_u141	Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me
s07_e05_c08_u142	(interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!
s07_e05_c08_u143	(outside the door) Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
s07_e05_c08_u144	You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
s07_e05_c09_u145	Good morning.
s07_e05_c09_u146	Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
s07_e05_c09_u147	Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
s07_e05_c09_u148	Ohh that's nice.
s07_e05_c09_u149	Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
s07_e05_c09_u150	Wo-women? You mean like old women?
s07_e05_c09_u151	Well kinda old, like 30.
s07_e05_c09_u152	(Pause) Oh.
s07_e05_c09_u153	And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
s07_e05_c09_u154	That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
s07_e05_c09_u155	A little.
s07_e05_c09_u156	Yeah?
s07_e05_c09_u157	(To her, in the Joey voice) How you doin'?
s07_e05_c10_u158	See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) You're changing it!
s07_e05_c10_u159	I can't help it!
s07_e05_c10_u160	All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
s07_e05_c10_u161	Borrow money from me?
s07_e05_c10_u162	Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and smiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), you're looking down, keep looking down
s07_e05_c10_u163	Why is there jelly on your shoe?
s07_e05_c10_u164	I had a donut. (Chandler nods.)
s07_e05_c10_u165	(entering) Hi!
s07_e05_c10_u166	Hey!
s07_e05_c10_u167	Hey!
s07_e05_c10_u168	So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
s07_e05_c10_u169	Yeah! That guy's all right!
s07_e05_c10_u170	Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
s07_e05_c10_u171	What?
s07_e05_c10_u172	Y'know, all the women.
s07_e05_c10_u173	Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
s07_e05_c10_u174	(Pause) I'm right here!
s07_e05_c10_u175	All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
s07_e05_c10_u176	Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
s07_e05_c10_u177	I'm still right here!
s07_e05_c10_u178	All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
s07_e05_c10_u179	(shocked) What?!
s07_e05_c10_u180	I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
s07_e05_c10_u181	I know, Monica told me.
s07_e05_c10_u182	Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
s07_e05_c10_u183	Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)
s07_e05_c10_u184	Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their attention.)
s07_e05_c10_u185	(To Joey) So, will you talk to him?
s07_e05_c10_u186	I don't know Rach.
s07_e05_c10_u187	Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
s07_e05_c10_u188	One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
s07_e05_c11_u189	Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
s07_e05_c11_u190	I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
s07_e05_c11_u191	Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
s07_e05_c11_u192	Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
s07_e05_c11_u193	Really?
s07_e05_c11_u194	Yeah, for you!
s07_e05_c12_u195	(seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!
s07_e05_c12_u196	There I am!
s07_e05_c12_u197	Are you okay?
s07_e05_c12_u198	Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
s07_e05_c12_u199	What?!
s07_e05_c12_u200	Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
s07_e05_c12_u201	Chandler, what were you thinking?
s07_e05_c12_u202	I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look down, look down- (He falls asleep.)
s07_e05_c12_u203	Chandler?
s07_e05_c12_u204	(awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
s07_e05_c13_u205	Hi.
s07_e05_c13_u206	Hi.
s07_e05_c13_u207	So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
s07_e05_c13_u208	Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
s07_e05_c13_u209	Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
s07_e05_c13_u210	Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
s07_e05_c13_u211	You think he's emotionally unavailable?
s07_e05_c13_u212	I think he can be.
s07_e05_c13_u213	Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
s07_e05_c13_u214	Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
s07_e05_c13_u215	Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
s07_e05_c13_u216	(angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
s07_e05_c13_u217	(gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!
s07_e05_c13_u218	So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.) I'm sorry you had to see that.
s07_e05_c14_u219	Good morning Rachel.
s07_e05_c14_u220	Hi! (He hands her, her mail) Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
s07_e05_c14_u221	Went out with Joey.
s07_e05_c14_u222	Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
s07_e05_c14_u223	No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
s07_e05_c14_u224	Wow! I did not see that coming.
s07_e05_c14_u225	It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when-Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
s07_e05_c14_u226	Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
s07_e05_c14_u227	When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
s07_e05_c14_u228	Really?
s07_e05_c14_u229	Someone I can spoil, y'know?
s07_e05_c14_u230	Sp-spoil?
s07_e05_c14_u231	Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
s07_e05_c14_u232	Uh-huh.
s07_e05_c14_u233	Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
s07_e05_c14_u234	Well, I-I'm startin' too.
s07_e05_c14_u235	And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
s07_e05_c14_u236	Yes! Hell yes!
s07_e05_c14_u237	All right then, it's settled.
s07_e05_c14_u238	Okay.
s07_e05_c14_u239	I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
s07_e05_c14_u240	I'd love to!
s07_e05_c14_u241	What?
s07_e05_c14_u242	(panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it) Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!
s07_e05_c15_u243	My God!
s07_e05_c15_u244	Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
s07_e05_c15_u245	Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
s07_e05_c15_u246	Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.
s07_e05_c15_u247	Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
s07_e05_c15_u248	We kinda need to talk.
s07_e05_c15_u249	Both of you together?
s07_e05_c15_u250	Wh-what's up?
s07_e05_c15_u251	Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing
s07_e05_c15_u252	we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So- (Pause)
s07_e05_c15_u253	Oh just say it Kyle!
s07_e05_c15_u254	We're gonna give it another try.
s07_e05_c15_u255	What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
s07_e05_c15_u256	I'm gonna work on that.
s07_e05_c15_u257	Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
s07_e05_c15_u258	(To Whitney) Y'know, he hums when he pees!
s07_e05_c15_u259	I do know.
s07_e05_c15_u260	It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
s07_e05_c15_u261	We're so sorry. (They get up to leave.)
s07_e05_c15_u262	That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
s07_e05_c15_u263	Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
s07_e05_c15_u264	Yeah, we're gonna go. (They leave.)
s07_e05_c15_u265	(To Phoebe) I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
s07_e05_c15_u266	Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
s07_e05_c15_u267	Yeah, were better off without them.
s07_e05_c15_u268	And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
s07_e05_c15_u269	Divorced men's club.
s07_e05_c15_u270	Potato, Potaato. (She's pronounces potato with the both the short and long As.)
s07_e05_c16_u271	Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
s07_e05_c16_u272	Ooh, let's see it!
s07_e05_c16_u273	Ahhh.
s07_e05_c16_u274	Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)
s07_e05_c16_u275	Oh yeah, that looks good.
s07_e05_c16_u276	You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)
s07_e05_c16_u277	Yeah, we look great together.
s07_e05_c16_u278	Yeah, we really do!
s07_e05_c16_u279	Okay.
s07_e05_c16_u280	Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
s07_e05_c16_u281	Y'know, we don't have to imagine.
s07_e05_c16_u282	I'm marrying her.
s07_e05_c16_u283	We'll just see.
s01_e12_c01_u001	No-no-no-no, we're done.
s01_e12_c02_u002	Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
s01_e12_c02_u003	Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)
s01_e12_c02_u004	Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)
s01_e12_c02_u005	And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
s01_e12_c02_u006	(softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)
s01_e12_c02_u007	Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
s01_e12_c02_u008	Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? (measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like voice) Hi Daddy!
s01_e12_c02_u009	(waves) Hello!
s01_e12_c02_u010	Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)
s01_e12_c02_u011	So, did I hear Poconos?
s01_e12_c02_u012	Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
s01_e12_c02_u013	Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
s01_e12_c02_u014	Yeah, that's a big step.
s01_e12_c02_u015	I know...
s01_e12_c02_u016	(to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
s01_e12_c02_u017	Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?
s01_e12_c02_u018	I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
s01_e12_c02_u019	...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!
s01_e12_c03_u020	I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
s01_e12_c03_u021	Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
s01_e12_c03_u022	Need a new table.
s01_e12_c03_u023	You think?
s01_e12_c04_u024	Hey hey, come on in!
s01_e12_c04_u025	Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
s01_e12_c04_u026	Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
s01_e12_c04_u027	So, I got the results of the amnio today.
s01_e12_c04_u028	Totally and completely healthy!
s01_e12_c04_u029	Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a picture frame)
s01_e12_c04_u030	Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
s01_e12_c04_u031	Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
s01_e12_c04_u032	Don't you want to know about the sex?
s01_e12_c04_u033	The sex of the baby, Ross.
s01_e12_c04_u034	Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
s01_e12_c04_u035	Do you want to know?
s01_e12_c04_u036	No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! (pauses) Or isn't...
s01_e12_c04_u037	Oh, hello Ross!
s01_e12_c04_u038	Susan...
s01_e12_c04_u039	So, so, did you hear?
s01_e12_c04_u040	Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
s01_e12_c04_u041	Oh, that's so... (Susan hugs Carol, they giggle, Ross steps away) It really is...do we know...?
s01_e12_c04_u042	Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
s01_e12_c04_u043	Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
s01_e12_c04_u044	Mm-hmmm (Susan and Carol hug, giggling. Ross stands back, reaches out and lightly taps Susan's shoulder)
s01_e12_c04_u045	Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
s01_e12_c04_u046	Well, thanks for the books.
s01_e12_c04_u047	No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach, then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)
s01_e12_c04_u048	All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona? (intercom buzzer rings)
s01_e12_c04_u049	Hello?
s01_e12_c05_u050	Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
s01_e12_c05_u051	That's the rule.
s01_e12_c05_u052	What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
s01_e12_c05_u053	How'd you get to that?
s01_e12_c05_u054	Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
s01_e12_c05_u055	You knew about that?
s01_e12_c05_u056	Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
s01_e12_c05_u057	Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
s01_e12_c05_u058	What do you mean, like, buy it together?
s01_e12_c05_u059	Yeah
s01_e12_c05_u060	You think we're ready for something like that?
s01_e12_c05_u061	Why not?
s01_e12_c05_u062	Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
s01_e12_c05_u063	Why, are you moving out?
s01_e12_c05_u064	I'm not moving out.
s01_e12_c05_u065	You'd tell me if you were moving out right
s01_e12_c05_u066	Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
s01_e12_c05_u067	Aw, I know all about Kip!
s01_e12_c05_u068	It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
s01_e12_c05_u069	Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
s01_e12_c05_u070	Aw, don't do that
s01_e12_c06_u071	Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)
s01_e12_c06_u072	Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
s01_e12_c06_u073	Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
s01_e12_c06_u074	Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
s01_e12_c06_u075	Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
s01_e12_c07_u076	And Monica knows...
s01_e12_c07_u077	Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
s01_e12_c07_u078	Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
s01_e12_c07_u079	So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest)
s01_e12_c07_u080	Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
s01_e12_c07_u081	I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
s01_e12_c07_u082	Or an uncle...
s01_e12_c07_u083	Hi Pheebs!
s01_e12_c07_u084	Pheebs!
s01_e12_c07_u085	Fine!
s01_e12_c07_u086	Phoebe, what's the matter?
s01_e12_c07_u087	Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
s01_e12_c07_u088	Oh, right, that's me!
s01_e12_c07_u089	Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
s01_e12_c07_u090	Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
s01_e12_c07_u091	Phoebe, what is it?
s01_e12_c07_u092	All right, you know Paolo?
s01_e12_c07_u093	I'm familiar with his work, yes...
s01_e12_c07_u094	Well, he made a move on me.
s01_e12_c07_u095	Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
s01_e12_c07_u096	More coffee over here, please!
s01_e12_c08_u097	Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.) And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues: Paolo rolls over, Phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)
s01_e12_c08_u098	Was it...?
s01_e12_c08_u099	Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
s01_e12_c08_u100	"Ooo," what?
s01_e12_c08_u101	Uma Thurman.
s01_e12_c08_u102	Oh!
s01_e12_c08_u103	The actress!
s01_e12_c08_u104	Thanks Rach.
s01_e12_c08_u105	So what are you gonna do?
s01_e12_c08_u106	You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to chime in)
s01_e12_c08_u107	Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
s01_e12_c08_u108	Feminist issue. That's where I went!
s01_e12_c08_u109	She is gonna hate me.
s01_e12_c09_u110	Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a table)
s01_e12_c09_u111	That's patio furniture!
s01_e12_c09_u112	So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
s01_e12_c09_u113	I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
s01_e12_c09_u114	You pick one.
s01_e12_c09_u115	All right, how about the ladybugs?
s01_e12_c09_u116	Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
s01_e12_c09_u117	Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
s01_e12_c09_u118	Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
s01_e12_c10_u119	Hey!
s01_e12_c10_u120	Hi Pheebs!
s01_e12_c10_u121	Are you moving out?
s01_e12_c10_u122	No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's.
s01_e12_c10_u123	Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
s01_e12_c10_u124	Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
s01_e12_c10_u125	Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um,
s01_e12_c10_u126	Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
s01_e12_c10_u127	Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)
s01_e12_c10_u128	Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
s01_e12_c10_u129	All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
s01_e12_c10_u130	Which proves that I never lie.
s01_e12_c10_u131	I guess you don't.
s01_e12_c10_u132	Paolo made a pass at me.
s01_e12_c11_u133	So, what do you think?
s01_e12_c11_u134	I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
s01_e12_c11_u135	I know!
s01_e12_c11_u136	So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
s01_e12_c11_u137	Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
s01_e12_c11_u138	Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at Chandler) You suck!
s01_e12_c12_u139	Are you okay?
s01_e12_c12_u140	I need some milk.
s01_e12_c12_u141	Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?
s01_e12_c12_u142	No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
s01_e12_c12_u143	I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
s01_e12_c12_u144	Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
s01_e12_c12_u145	No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
s01_e12_c12_u146	I don't know...right, he's the pig!
s01_e12_c12_u147	Such a pig!
s01_e12_c12_u148	Oh, God, he's such a pig,
s01_e12_c12_u149	Oh he's like a...
s01_e12_c12_u150	He's like a big disgusting...
s01_e12_c12_u151	...like a...
s01_e12_c12_u152	...pig...pig man!
s01_e12_c12_u153	Yes, good! Ok...
s01_e12_c12_u154	(voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
s01_e12_c12_u155	(raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
s01_e12_c12_u156	Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
s01_e12_c12_u157	The end.
s01_e12_c12_u158	Oh, God...
s01_e12_c12_u159	Should I not have told you?
s01_e12_c12_u160	No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
s01_e12_c13_u161	I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
s01_e12_c13_u162	No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
s01_e12_c13_u163	Come on, two on one.
s01_e12_c13_u164	What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
s01_e12_c13_u165	What, now?
s01_e12_c13_u166	Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
s01_e12_c13_u167	My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
s01_e12_c14_u168	(entering) How's it going?
s01_e12_c14_u169	Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
s01_e12_c14_u170	Ooh!
s01_e12_c14_u171	Oh, ok bye-bye.
s01_e12_c14_u172	Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
s01_e12_c14_u173	Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)
s01_e12_c14_u174	Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)
s01_e12_c14_u175	Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
s01_e12_c14_u176	Oh, you're right.
s01_e12_c14_u177	(pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
s01_e12_c14_u178	Hey.
s01_e12_c14_u179	Hey.
s01_e12_c14_u180	You all right?
s01_e12_c14_u181	Ooh, I've been better...
s01_e12_c14_u182	Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
s01_e12_c14_u183	Oh, Ross...
s01_e12_c14_u184	What?
s01_e12_c14_u185	I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)
s01_e12_c14_u186	Huh.
s01_e12_c14_u187	Oh Ross, you're so great!
s01_e12_c14_u188	Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
s01_e12_c14_u189	Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
s01_e12_c14_u190	Oh...
s01_e12_c14_u191	You ok?
s01_e12_c14_u192	...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
s01_e12_c14_u193	Yep!
s01_e12_c14_u194	See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
s01_e12_c14_u195	No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
s01_e12_c14_u196	Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
s01_e12_c14_u197	No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
s01_e12_c14_u198	What?
s01_e12_c14_u199	I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
s01_e12_c14_u200	Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
s01_e12_c14_u201	Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?
s01_e12_c14_u202	Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)
s01_e12_c14_u203	I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
s01_e12_c14_u204	Wha-
s01_e12_c14_u205	Wha-
s01_e12_c14_u206	What is it?
s01_e12_c14_u207	I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
s01_e12_c14_u208	Hey!
s01_e12_c14_u209	Hey!
s01_e12_c14_u210	I'm having a son. Um...
s01_e12_c15_u211	Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
s01_e12_c15_u212	Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
s01_e12_c15_u213	Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
s01_e12_c15_u214	Yeah, get out!
s01_e12_c15_u215	You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
s01_e12_c15_u216	(to Joey) One more game?
s01_e12_c15_u217	Oh yeah!
s09_e21_c01_u001	It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
s09_e21_c01_u002	Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
s09_e21_c01_u003	I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?
s09_e21_c01_u004	Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
s09_e21_c01_u005	I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
s09_e21_c01_u006	Why do you care so much?
s09_e21_c01_u007	Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
s09_e21_c01_u008	(worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
s09_e21_c01_u009	Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
s09_e21_c01_u010	Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
s09_e21_c01_u011	All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
s09_e21_c01_u012	Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
s09_e21_c01_u013	Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
s09_e21_c01_u014	Hey!
s09_e21_c01_u015	Hi!
s09_e21_c01_u016	I'm gonna get some more coffee.
s09_e21_c01_u017	Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
s09_e21_c01_u018	Ok. (they both go)
s09_e21_c01_u019	(to Joey) So, a professor, uh?
s09_e21_c01_u020	Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being Joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) That's not how she used it...?
s09_e21_c01_u021	(talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
s09_e21_c01_u022	Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
s09_e21_c01_u023	You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...
s09_e21_c01_u024	Yeah, I know the type.
s09_e21_c01_u025	Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
s09_e21_c02_u026	(entering) Hey!
s09_e21_c02_u027	Hey!
s09_e21_c02_u028	Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)
s09_e21_c02_u029	Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
s09_e21_c02_u030	I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
s09_e21_c02_u031	(after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
s09_e21_c02_u032	Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
s09_e21_c02_u033	Hey, what's this?
s09_e21_c02_u034	Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
s09_e21_c02_u035	Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
s09_e21_c02_u036	Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
s09_e21_c02_u037	Do you wanna go hunting?
s09_e21_c02_u038	Well, I would like to have the option!!
s09_e21_c02_u039	(coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!
s09_e21_c02_u040	Oh!
s09_e21_c02_u041	No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
s09_e21_c02_u042	And she wants to go hunting, too!!
s09_e21_c02_u043	Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
s09_e21_c02_u044	Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
s09_e21_c02_u045	I don't care about any of that!!
s09_e21_c02_u046	Well, do you care about friendship?
s09_e21_c02_u047	Oh!
s09_e21_c02_u048	I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
s09_e21_c02_u049	Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
s09_e21_c02_u050	Promise?
s09_e21_c02_u051	I promise.
s09_e21_c02_u052	Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
s09_e21_c02_u053	But I am going hunting!!
s09_e21_c03_u054	(entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!
s09_e21_c03_u055	Oh, yeah?
s09_e21_c03_u056	Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?
s09_e21_c03_u057	Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)
s09_e21_c03_u058	Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
s09_e21_c03_u059	We really need to take those tests?
s09_e21_c03_u060	Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
s09_e21_c03_u061	But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
s09_e21_c03_u062	What is the big deal?
s09_e21_c03_u063	It's weird! In a doctor's office?
s09_e21_c03_u064	It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
s09_e21_c03_u065	(embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
s09_e21_c03_u066	Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
s09_e21_c03_u067	Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
s09_e21_c03_u068	(really embarrassed) OH!
s09_e21_c03_u069	Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
s09_e21_c04_u070	(sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
s09_e21_c04_u071	Heeey!
s09_e21_c04_u072	Hi!
s09_e21_c04_u073	Come on in, how are ya?
s09_e21_c04_u074	I'm good!
s09_e21_c04_u075	Can I offer you a drink?
s09_e21_c04_u076	Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book...
s09_e21_c04_u077	Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!
s09_e21_c04_u078	So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
s09_e21_c04_u079	Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)
s09_e21_c04_u080	Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
s09_e21_c04_u081	Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
s09_e21_c04_u082	Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
s09_e21_c04_u083	(looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!
s09_e21_c04_u084	And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
s09_e21_c04_u085	I know, yeah!
s09_e21_c04_u086	And first, I have to see the MET!
s09_e21_c04_u087	Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
s09_e21_c04_u088	No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
s09_e21_c04_u089	Which one, they all suck!
s09_e21_c04_u090	The museum!
s09_e21_c04_u091	(looking puzzled) I don't think so.
s09_e21_c05_u092	(to the receptionist) Hi there!
s09_e21_c05_u093	(in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?
s09_e21_c05_u094	Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
s09_e21_c05_u095	This has been torn up.
s09_e21_c05_u096	And... taped back together.
s09_e21_c05_u097	Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.
s09_e21_c05_u098	Ok
s09_e21_c05_u099	Have a seat through the glass doors.
s09_e21_c05_u100	(imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
s09_e21_c05_u101	Through the glass doors.
s09_e21_c05_u102	Alright-y then.
s09_e21_c05_u103	Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
s09_e21_c05_u104	Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
s09_e21_c05_u105	Sorry, everyone is booked!
s09_e21_c05_u106	But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
s09_e21_c05_u107	Then why you work here?
s09_e21_c05_u108	'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
s09_e21_c05_u109	Well, I think this is a great place to work!
s09_e21_c05_u110	(watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?
s09_e21_c06_u111	Ross!
s09_e21_c06_u112	Hi!
s09_e21_c06_u113	I need to talk to you about Charlie.
s09_e21_c06_u114	(annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?
s09_e21_c06_u115	Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
s09_e21_c06_u116	Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
s09_e21_c06_u117	No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
s09_e21_c06_u118	Get to the problem!
s09_e21_c06_u119	Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
s09_e21_c06_u120	(looking down) Are you wearing two belts?
s09_e21_c06_u121	(checking) EH, what do you know!
s09_e21_c06_u122	You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
s09_e21_c06_u123	Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
s09_e21_c06_u124	You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
s09_e21_c06_u125	Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
s09_e21_c06_u126	(after a short hesitation) Fine.
s09_e21_c06_u127	Thanks.
s09_e21_c06_u128	Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
s09_e21_c06_u129	The Metsss!
s09_e21_c06_u130	Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
s09_e21_c06_u131	(realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
s09_e21_c06_u132	Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
s09_e21_c06_u133	Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
s09_e21_c06_u134	Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
s09_e21_c06_u135	Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
s09_e21_c06_u136	But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
s09_e21_c06_u137	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
s09_e21_c06_u138	Ok.
s09_e21_c06_u139	You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
s09_e21_c06_u140	Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
s09_e21_c06_u141	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the right and Joey nods)
s09_e21_c07_u142	I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
s09_e21_c07_u143	Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
s09_e21_c07_u144	Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
s09_e21_c07_u145	Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
s09_e21_c07_u146	Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
s09_e21_c07_u147	Yeah, I guess!
s09_e21_c07_u148	I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
s09_e21_c07_u149	OH MY GOD!!
s09_e21_c07_u150	Oh, Come on!
s09_e21_c07_u151	Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
s09_e21_c07_u152	Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
s09_e21_c07_u153	Why are you here?
s09_e21_c07_u154	Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...
s09_e21_c07_u155	(to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??
s09_e21_c07_u156	Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking at the cup in his hand).
s09_e21_c07_u157	What!?
s09_e21_c07_u158	This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)
s09_e21_c07_u159	I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)
s09_e21_c07_u160	Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you need a hand!
s09_e21_c07_u161	(disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)
s09_e21_c08_u162	(In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
s09_e21_c08_u163	Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her head in the hole and Phoebe enters)
s09_e21_c08_u164	Okay, then I'm Swedish...
s09_e21_c08_u165	So, what's your name?
s09_e21_c08_u166	It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
s09_e21_c08_u167	Oh... what an interesting name.
s09_e21_c08_u168	Ja!
s09_e21_c08_u169	You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's direction)
s09_e21_c08_u170	(pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!
s09_e21_c08_u171	(Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)
s09_e21_c08_u172	Is something wrong?
s09_e21_c08_u173	No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
s09_e21_c08_u174	(Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.
s09_e21_c08_u175	Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
s09_e21_c09_u176	(gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
s09_e21_c09_u177	Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
s09_e21_c09_u178	(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
s09_e21_c09_u179	Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
s09_e21_c09_u180	Phonetically? (Looks confused)
s09_e21_c09_u181	Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
s09_e21_c09_u182	Ok.
s09_e21_c09_u183	Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
s09_e21_c09_u184	Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
s09_e21_c09_u185	Wow. What does that mean?
s09_e21_c09_u186	No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
s09_e21_c09_u187	Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
s09_e21_c09_u188	Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).
s09_e21_c09_u189	Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
s09_e21_c09_u190	Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
s09_e21_c09_u191	No! (Slaps his hand)
s09_e21_c10_u192	(To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?
s09_e21_c10_u193	Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
s09_e21_c10_u194	Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
s09_e21_c10_u195	That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
s09_e21_c10_u196	I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
s09_e21_c10_u197	Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
s09_e21_c10_u198	(Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
s09_e21_c10_u199	Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
s09_e21_c10_u200	(smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
s09_e21_c10_u201	What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
s09_e21_c10_u202	(stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!! "
s09_e21_c11_u203	(Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
s09_e21_c11_u204	Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
s09_e21_c11_u205	Oh, Ja! Ja!
s09_e21_c11_u206	Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)
s09_e21_c11_u207	Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
s09_e21_c11_u208	I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
s09_e21_c11_u209	Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
s09_e21_c11_u210	(now lifts her head) Phoebe!!
s09_e21_c11_u211	You know it's me?
s09_e21_c11_u212	For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
s09_e21_c11_u213	How can you come here?
s09_e21_c11_u214	How could you not tell me you worked here?
s09_e21_c11_u215	I don't have to tell you everything!
s09_e21_c11_u216	Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
s09_e21_c11_u217	Tips not included.
s09_e21_c11_u218	Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
s09_e21_c11_u219	Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
s09_e21_c11_u220	Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
s09_e21_c11_u221	You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
s09_e21_c11_u222	Good for you Pheebs!
s09_e21_c11_u223	Ok.
s09_e21_c11_u224	Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
s09_e21_c12_u225	Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
s09_e21_c12_u226	(recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!
s09_e21_c12_u227	Hi!
s09_e21_c12_u228	Hey, how was the Met?
s09_e21_c12_u229	The museum was amazing!
s09_e21_c12_u230	Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
s09_e21_c12_u231	Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
s09_e21_c12_u232	What do you mean?
s09_e21_c12_u233	Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
s09_e21_c12_u234	(perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
s09_e21_c12_u235	No, we went to the left.
s09_e21_c12_u236	(shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
s09_e21_c12_u237	Yeah, it's fun (hesitating).
s09_e21_c12_u238	What?
s09_e21_c12_u239	Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
s09_e21_c12_u240	What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
s09_e21_c12_u241	Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
s09_e21_c12_u242	(slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
s09_e21_c12_u243	Yeah, I guess that's true.
s09_e21_c12_u244	And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
s09_e21_c12_u245	He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
s09_e21_c12_u246	That was going to be my next argument.
s09_e21_c12_u247	Hey!
s09_e21_c12_u248	Hey!
s09_e21_c12_u249	Hey!
s09_e21_c12_u250	(to Charlie) You're ready?
s09_e21_c12_u251	Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks Ross.
s09_e21_c12_u252	(aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
s09_e21_c12_u253	Glad I could help man.
s09_e21_c12_u254	Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) I made it work.
s09_e21_c13_u255	(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
s09_e21_c13_u256	Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)
s09_e21_c13_u257	Hey sweetie.
s09_e21_c13_u258	Doctor Connelly just called.
s09_e21_c13_u259	With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
s09_e21_c13_u260	Actually it's both of us.
s09_e21_c13_u261	What?
s09_e21_c13_u262	Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
s09_e21_c13_u263	Oh... what does that mean?
s09_e21_c13_u264	It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...
s09_e21_c13_u265	Chandler?
s09_e21_c13_u266	(seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
s09_e21_c13_u267	(weeping) Oh my God!
s09_e21_c13_u268	I'm sorry.
s09_e21_c13_u269	I'm sorry too.
s09_e21_c13_u270	Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
s09_e21_c13_u271	(still weeping) I know.
s09_e21_c14_u272	Good morning Phoebe.
s09_e21_c14_u273	(imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.
s09_e21_c14_u274	Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.
s09_e21_c14_u275	Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?
s09_e21_c14_u276	(through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
s03_e08_c01_u001	Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
s03_e08_c01_u002	I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)
s03_e08_c01_u003	Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
s03_e08_c01_u004	Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)
s03_e08_c01_u005	No, no, it's just my tooth.
s03_e08_c01_u006	All right I'll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)
s03_e08_c01_u007	So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
s03_e08_c01_u008	No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
s03_e08_c01_u009	See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
s03_e08_c01_u010	Why? Why can't you go to him?
s03_e08_c01_u011	Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
s03_e08_c01_u012	That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
s03_e08_c01_u013	Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
s03_e08_c01_u014	Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob'.
s03_e08_c01_u015	And all these people actually died?
s03_e08_c01_u016	Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
s03_e08_c01_u017	Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
s03_e08_c01_u018	Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
s03_e08_c02_u019	Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?
s03_e08_c02_u020	Oh, like you don't already have everything.
s03_e08_c02_u021	(trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
s03_e08_c02_u022	Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
s03_e08_c02_u023	All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
s03_e08_c02_u024	I promise.
s03_e08_c02_u025	Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
s03_e08_c02_u026	(entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
s03_e08_c02_u027	(patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he's not.
s03_e08_c02_u028	You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
s03_e08_c02_u029	What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
s03_e08_c02_u030	Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
s03_e08_c02_u031	Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
s03_e08_c02_u032	It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
s03_e08_c02_u033	Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
s03_e08_c03_u034	(looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
s03_e08_c03_u035	Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)
s03_e08_c03_u036	Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
s03_e08_c03_u037	What did they do?
s03_e08_c03_u038	Well, they painted over the word Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
s03_e08_c03_u039	So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
s03_e08_c03_u040	Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
s03_e08_c03_u041	Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
s03_e08_c03_u042	You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths Don't worry, I'll be here the whole time.' to Ross.) Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths Yeah!' and holds up her thumb.)
s03_e08_c03_u043	Hey-hey, Ross?
s03_e08_c03_u044	Yeah.
s03_e08_c03_u045	I've got a science question.
s03_e08_c03_u046	Hmm?
s03_e08_c03_u047	If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
s03_e08_c03_u048	Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
s03_e08_c03_u049	Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
s03_e08_c04_u050	(holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
s03_e08_c04_u051	Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) We're gonna do something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in the air a little bit and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits Ben's head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)
s03_e08_c04_u052	(to Ben) Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
s03_e08_c04_u053	Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that's a good boy. (to Monica) How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
s03_e08_c04_u054	He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
s03_e08_c04_u055	We're not?!
s03_e08_c04_u056	No we're not.
s03_e08_c04_u057	All right, I like that.
s03_e08_c04_u058	Okay.
s03_e08_c04_u059	So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, (starts to exam Ben) aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
s03_e08_c04_u060	Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
s03_e08_c04_u061	I cannot push it in!
s03_e08_c04_u062	Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
s03_e08_c04_u063	Okay, okay, okay.
s03_e08_c04_u064	I got it!
s03_e08_c04_u065	Okay.
s03_e08_c04_u066	The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!
s03_e08_c04_u067	Or. We could put a hat on his head.
s03_e08_c04_u068	A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
s03_e08_c04_u069	We need a hat..
s03_e08_c04_u070	Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
s03_e08_c04_u071	Oh, oh, oh, I'll get Rainy Day Bear'!! (runs to get him)
s03_e08_c04_u072	Because he'll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her room with a bear that's dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God, you're a genius!
s03_e08_c04_u073	Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
s03_e08_c04_u074	Give it. Give it.
s03_e08_c04_u075	Okay.
s03_e08_c04_u076	Oh!!
s03_e08_c04_u077	Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
s03_e08_c05_u078	Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
s03_e08_c05_u079	I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
s03_e08_c05_u080	Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
s03_e08_c05_u081	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
s03_e08_c05_u082	That's a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
s03_e08_c05_u083	Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
s03_e08_c05_u084	All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)
s03_e08_c05_u085	(stopping him) No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
s03_e08_c05_u086	Why not?!
s03_e08_c05_u087	Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
s03_e08_c05_u088	What is the thing?
s03_e08_c05_u089	Okay. I went down to the Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
s03_e08_c05_u090	(shocked) What?
s03_e08_c05_u091	They were in his office.
s03_e08_c05_u092	Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
s03_e08_c05_u093	I'm telling you man, I saw it.
s03_e08_c05_u094	Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
s03_e08_c05_u095	I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
s03_e08_c06_u096	It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
s03_e08_c06_u097	Right.
s03_e08_c06_u098	Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
s03_e08_c06_u099	(running through the door) No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
s03_e08_c06_u100	See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
s03_e08_c06_u101	Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
s03_e08_c06_u102	Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
s03_e08_c06_u103	(on phone) Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'
s03_e08_c06_u104	Monica.
s03_e08_c06_u105	Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
s03_e08_c06_u106	Monica bang!
s03_e08_c06_u107	Okay, I heard that.
s03_e08_c06_u108	Did he just say Monica bang'?
s03_e08_c06_u109	Uh-huh.
s03_e08_c06_u110	Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
s03_e08_c06_u111	Monica bang!
s03_e08_c06_u112	Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang. (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats) Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
s03_e08_c06_u113	(goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that! (repeats) Look at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay, I'm stopping now.
s03_e08_c06_u114	You okay?
s03_e08_c06_u115	Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
s03_e08_c07_u116	(entering) How's my Bing-a-ling?
s03_e08_c07_u117	Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
s03_e08_c07_u118	Why are your eyes so white?
s03_e08_c07_u119	You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
s03_e08_c07_u120	Oh my God!!
s03_e08_c07_u121	All right!
s03_e08_c07_u122	How did you know?
s03_e08_c07_u123	Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
s03_e08_c07_u124	In the park?
s03_e08_c07_u125	No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
s03_e08_c07_u126	Just those two!
s03_e08_c07_u127	Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
s03_e08_c07_u128	Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, (nasally) haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just (nasally) haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
s03_e08_c07_u129	(giving her a bag) Here.
s03_e08_c07_u130	The receipt.
s03_e08_c07_u131	I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)
s03_e08_c07_u132	I don't know.
s03_e08_c07_u133	(rushing in) Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
s03_e08_c08_u134	Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
s03_e08_c08_u135	Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!
s03_e08_c08_u136	You said number two.
s03_e08_c08_u137	I also said number one.
s03_e08_c08_u138	I know. (giggles harder)
s03_e08_c08_u139	(entering) Hey! Everyone.
s03_e08_c08_u140	Hi!
s03_e08_c08_u141	How's my little boy?
s03_e08_c08_u142	He's perfect, he's never been better.
s03_e08_c08_u143	(noticing the outfit he is wearing) What'd you do, take him whaling?
s03_e08_c08_u144	Monica.
s03_e08_c08_u145	Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
s03_e08_c08_u146	Monica bang!
s03_e08_c08_u147	Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
s03_e08_c08_u148	Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
s03_e08_c08_u149	Uh.
s03_e08_c08_u150	What?
s03_e08_c08_u151	Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
s03_e08_c08_u152	Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
s03_e08_c08_u153	Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
s03_e08_c08_u154	I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
s03_e08_c08_u155	All right, we should call somebody.
s03_e08_c08_u156	And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
s03_e08_c08_u157	Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
s03_e08_c08_u158	How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
s03_e08_c08_u159	Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
s03_e08_c09_u160	Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
s03_e08_c09_u161	Yeah.
s03_e08_c09_u162	Well, now we got a reason.
s03_e08_c09_u163	What?
s03_e08_c09_u164	Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
s03_e08_c09_u165	All right.
s03_e08_c09_u166	Hey uh, what's a matter?
s03_e08_c09_u167	I talked to Janice.
s03_e08_c09_u168	Oh my God, is she going back to him?
s03_e08_c09_u169	She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
s03_e08_c09_u170	What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
s03_e08_c09_u171	I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
s03_e08_c09_u172	Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
s03_e08_c09_u173	Come on, tell me.
s03_e08_c09_u174	All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I would bow out.
s03_e08_c09_u175	What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?
s03_e08_c09_u176	They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
s03_e08_c10_u177	Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
s03_e08_c10_u178	Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
s03_e08_c10_u179	It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
s03_e08_c10_u180	(confidently) I did!
s03_e08_c10_u181	I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
s03_e08_c10_u182	I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
s03_e08_c10_u183	Monica did it?
s03_e08_c10_u184	Monica?
s03_e08_c10_u185	Yeah.
s03_e08_c10_u186	Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
s03_e08_c10_u187	No. Why?
s03_e08_c10_u188	Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out e' and f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
s03_e08_c10_u189	Really?!
s03_e08_c10_u190	Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle)
s03_e08_c10_u191	Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)
s03_e08_c10_u192	I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
s03_e08_c10_u193	(coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living room)
s03_e08_c10_u194	Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
s03_e08_c10_u195	I'll get the hat.
s03_e08_c11_u196	Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
s03_e08_c11_u197	Okay.
s03_e08_c11_u198	I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
s03_e08_c11_u199	Wow!
s03_e08_c11_u200	Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
s03_e08_c11_u201	Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
s03_e08_c11_u202	Then don't leave me!
s03_e08_c11_u203	What?
s03_e08_c11_u204	Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
s03_e08_c11_u205	No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
s03_e08_c11_u206	No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
s03_e08_c11_u207	(standing up) I'm sorry. (hugs him)
s03_e08_c11_u208	Ohhh. Don't go.
s03_e08_c11_u209	No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn't let her go.)
s03_e08_c11_u210	No. No! No! No!
s03_e08_c11_u211	Honey, honey, people are looking.
s03_e08_c11_u212	I don't care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I don't care!!
s03_e08_c11_u213	Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of Chandler's grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)
s03_e08_c11_u214	You can't leave! I have your shoe!
s03_e08_c11_u215	Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)
s03_e08_c11_u216	Rachel has those in burgendy.
s03_e08_c12_u217	All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
s03_e08_c12_u218	Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
s03_e08_c12_u219	I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
s03_e08_c12_u220	All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. (they start to advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
s03_e08_c12_u221	He's alive! He's a-live!!!
s03_e08_c12_u222	And yet, we're still poking him.
s03_e08_c12_u223	Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
s03_e08_c12_u224	He does not look happy.
s03_e08_c12_u225	Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
s03_e08_c12_u226	Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
s03_e08_c13_u227	(singing) I'll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I can't resist your charms. And love....
s03_e08_c13_u228	(joining him) Love....
s03_e08_c13_u229	I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
s03_e08_c13_u230	(high pitched) No you know I don't mind.
s03_e08_c13_u231	Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
s03_e08_c13_u232	I know.
s03_e08_c13_u233	I know.
s03_e08_c13_u234	I've found.
s03_e08_c13_u235	I've found....
s03_e08_c13_u236	...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched, Chandler goes low pitched) love. (they both look at each other.) My endless love. (once again they don't match tones, and they just look at each other)
s10_e08_c01_u001	Hey guys!
s10_e08_c01_u002	Hi!
s10_e08_c01_u003	Hey!
s10_e08_c01_u004	We need to talk to you about something.
s10_e08_c01_u005	Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
s10_e08_c01_u006	What?
s10_e08_c01_u007	Hey!
s10_e08_c01_u008	Are you kidding?
s10_e08_c01_u009	Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
s10_e08_c01_u010	(skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
s10_e08_c01_u011	No, no! We made this decision together.
s10_e08_c01_u012	She's putting words in your mouth!
s10_e08_c01_u013	Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
s10_e08_c01_u014	I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
s10_e08_c01_u015	No, it's not!
s10_e08_c01_u016	It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?
s10_e08_c01_u017	Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
s10_e08_c01_u018	Thank you, Pheebs!
s10_e08_c01_u019	Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
s10_e08_c01_u020	What? You are way off, lady!
s10_e08_c01_u021	Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
s10_e08_c01_u022	That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
s10_e08_c01_u023	Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
s10_e08_c01_u024	Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
s10_e08_c01_u025	We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
s10_e08_c02_u026	Hey!
s10_e08_c02_u027	Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
s10_e08_c02_u028	Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
s10_e08_c02_u029	You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
s10_e08_c02_u030	You're not making the pies yourself?
s10_e08_c02_u031	No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
s10_e08_c02_u032	Did you at least win the contest?
s10_e08_c02_u033	2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
s10_e08_c02_u034	Can't wait!
s10_e08_c02_u035	This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
s10_e08_c02_u036	Hey Rach.
s10_e08_c02_u037	Yeah.
s10_e08_c02_u038	What's Emma doing today?
s10_e08_c02_u039	Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
s10_e08_c02_u040	Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
s10_e08_c02_u041	Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
s10_e08_c02_u042	Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
s10_e08_c02_u043	Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
s10_e08_c02_u044	(sarcastic) Oh... okay.
s10_e08_c02_u045	Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
s10_e08_c02_u046	And a thousand dollars.
s10_e08_c02_u047	...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is important...
s10_e08_c02_u048	Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
s10_e08_c02_u049	Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
s10_e08_c02_u050	Well, I was thinking...
s10_e08_c02_u051	Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
s10_e08_c02_u052	Yeah!
s10_e08_c03_u053	(Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the baton again?
s10_e08_c03_u054	Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
s10_e08_c03_u055	(she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!
s10_e08_c03_u056	You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
s10_e08_c03_u057	You don't know that.
s10_e08_c03_u058	Somebody is gonna pick us.
s10_e08_c03_u059	Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
s10_e08_c03_u060	I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favourite author!
s10_e08_c03_u061	Name one of his books.
s10_e08_c03_u062	(after a long pause) "The Firm"?
s10_e08_c03_u063	Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
s10_e08_c03_u064	You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
s10_e08_c03_u065	Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
s10_e08_c03_u066	I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
s10_e08_c03_u067	Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
s10_e08_c03_u068	Tell me more.
s10_e08_c03_u069	Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)
s10_e08_c03_u070	You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
s10_e08_c03_u071	Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
s10_e08_c03_u072	Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
s10_e08_c03_u073	Dude, I wanted him to guess.
s10_e08_c03_u074	Oh.
s10_e08_c03_u075	Oh my God!
s10_e08_c03_u076	Yeah, they're great seats too!
s10_e08_c03_u077	Guess where they are?
s10_e08_c03_u078	Center ice.
s10_e08_c03_u079	Did I do something to you?
s10_e08_c03_u080	Hmm, the game's at one.
s10_e08_c03_u081	So?
s10_e08_c03_u082	Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
s10_e08_c03_u083	So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
s10_e08_c03_u084	You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
s10_e08_c03_u085	Dude, two times that happened!
s10_e08_c03_u086	Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
s10_e08_c03_u087	He's right, man.
s10_e08_c03_u088	Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
s10_e08_c03_u089	Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
s10_e08_c03_u090	That's some gentle comedy, dude. (he and Ross leave)
s10_e08_c03_u091	We're still going at the game, right?
s10_e08_c03_u092	Yeah!
s10_e08_c03_u093	Yeah.
s10_e08_c04_u094	This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
s10_e08_c04_u095	Hey.
s10_e08_c04_u096	Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
s10_e08_c04_u097	We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
s10_e08_c04_u098	Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
s10_e08_c04_u099	Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
s10_e08_c04_u100	Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
s10_e08_c04_u101	(panicking) But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
s10_e08_c04_u102	Phoebe, you have to calm down.
s10_e08_c04_u103	Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
s10_e08_c04_u104	Really?
s10_e08_c04_u105	Yeah!
s10_e08_c04_u106	You heard them say that?
s10_e08_c04_u107	Yeah!
s10_e08_c04_u108	All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
s10_e08_c04_u109	Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
s10_e08_c04_u110	No, what?
s10_e08_c04_u111	Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
s10_e08_c04_u112	No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
s10_e08_c04_u113	Why not!
s10_e08_c04_u114	Because I already did!
s10_e08_c05_u115	Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
s10_e08_c05_u116	Oh! What a game, huh?
s10_e08_c05_u117	I know, yeah.
s10_e08_c05_u118	I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
s10_e08_c05_u119	Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
s10_e08_c05_u120	Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
s10_e08_c05_u121	Ohhhh! These seats are great!
s10_e08_c05_u122	I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
s10_e08_c05_u123	(looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
s10_e08_c05_u124	Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
s10_e08_c05_u125	I don't know...
s10_e08_c05_u126	One more fight!
s10_e08_c05_u127	Okay.
s10_e08_c05_u128	Okay.
s10_e08_c06_u129	Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
s10_e08_c06_u130	I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
s10_e08_c07_u131	How late are we?
s10_e08_c07_u132	Forty-five minutes.
s10_e08_c07_u133	Wow (He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)
s10_e08_c07_u134	(handing him his coat) Here!
s10_e08_c07_u135	Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)
s10_e08_c07_u136	You may want to lose the foam finger!
s10_e08_c07_u137	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
s10_e08_c07_u138	Hey!
s10_e08_c07_u139	Oh!
s10_e08_c07_u140	You are not at Thanksgiving?
s10_e08_c07_u141	No...
s10_e08_c07_u142	No, we're late!
s10_e08_c07_u143	What are you doing here!
s10_e08_c07_u144	We're late too! (Rachel screams)
s10_e08_c07_u145	We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls)
s10_e08_c07_u146	Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
s10_e08_c07_u147	So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
s10_e08_c07_u148	Yeah, where were you!
s10_e08_c07_u149	Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
s10_e08_c07_u150	Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
s10_e08_c07_u151	And I won!
s10_e08_c07_u152	You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
s10_e08_c07_u153	Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!
s10_e08_c07_u154	Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachel's hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
s10_e08_c07_u155	Yeah. That's me!
s10_e08_c07_u156	You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
s10_e08_c07_u157	And it looks like she put makeup on her!
s10_e08_c07_u158	Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
s10_e08_c07_u159	I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
s10_e08_c07_u160	She won a thousand dollars!
s10_e08_c07_u161	So this is an annual thing?
s10_e08_c07_u162	(realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
s10_e08_c07_u163	You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
s10_e08_c07_u164	Yeah. What are we gonna do?
s10_e08_c07_u165	Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
s10_e08_c07_u166	All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
s10_e08_c07_u167	Alright, what are we gonna say?
s10_e08_c07_u168	Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
s10_e08_c07_u169	Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
s10_e08_c07_u170	No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)
s10_e08_c07_u171	(to Joey) HEY!
s10_e08_c08_u172	Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)
s10_e08_c08_u173	(peeping) They're out there!
s10_e08_c08_u174	Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
s10_e08_c08_u175	(peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
s10_e08_c08_u176	(gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
s10_e08_c08_u177	(looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.
s10_e08_c08_u178	Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
s10_e08_c08_u179	Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?
s10_e08_c08_u180	I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
s10_e08_c08_u181	We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
s10_e08_c08_u182	(sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
s10_e08_c08_u183	You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
s10_e08_c08_u184	(Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)
s10_e08_c08_u185	(whispering) Who do you think its from?
s10_e08_c08_u186	Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
s10_e08_c08_u187	Well, let's just go in there and face them.
s10_e08_c08_u188	Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
s10_e08_c08_u189	I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
s10_e08_c08_u190	Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).
s10_e08_c08_u191	(smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!
s10_e08_c08_u192	What is that?
s10_e08_c08_u193	That's fire. Beats everything.
s10_e08_c08_u194	Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his "fire" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out).
s10_e08_c08_u195	Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
s10_e08_c08_u196	Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
s10_e08_c08_u197	Alright, okay. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)
s10_e08_c08_u198	It's locked.
s10_e08_c08_u199	Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
s10_e08_c08_u200	Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
s10_e08_c08_u201	No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
s10_e08_c08_u202	Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
s10_e08_c08_u203	(Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.
s10_e08_c08_u204	(relieved) Oh thank God!
s10_e08_c08_u205	Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
s10_e08_c08_u206	(looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
s10_e08_c08_u207	(to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
s10_e08_c08_u208	You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
s10_e08_c08_u209	I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)
s10_e08_c08_u210	That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
s10_e08_c08_u211	How are we gonna decide who gets this?
s10_e08_c08_u212	(holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)
s10_e08_c08_u213	What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
s10_e08_c08_u214	(gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
s10_e08_c08_u215	Oh yeah!
s10_e08_c08_u216	Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
s10_e08_c08_u217	Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)
s10_e08_c08_u218	Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)
s10_e08_c08_u219	That's worse than no food.
s10_e08_c08_u220	HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
s10_e08_c08_u221	Stinky?!
s10_e08_c08_u222	Please let me stay on this side of the door.
s10_e08_c08_u223	Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.
s10_e08_c08_u224	Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
s10_e08_c08_u225	You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)
s10_e08_c08_u226	(to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
s10_e08_c08_u227	I don't know...
s10_e08_c08_u228	I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.
s10_e08_c08_u229	(Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!
s10_e08_c08_u230	Oh!
s10_e08_c08_u231	Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
s10_e08_c08_u232	The cranberries...?
s10_e08_c08_u233	Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
s10_e08_c08_u234	(still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
s10_e08_c08_u235	He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)
s10_e08_c08_u236	Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?
s10_e08_c08_u237	I feel terrible.
s10_e08_c08_u238	So, so sorry.
s10_e08_c08_u239	(smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
s10_e08_c08_u240	The floating heads do make a good point.
s10_e08_c08_u241	Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
s10_e08_c08_u242	So bad.
s10_e08_c08_u243	So bad.
s10_e08_c08_u244	(Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
s10_e08_c08_u245	Dessert?
s10_e08_c08_u246	Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
s10_e08_c08_u247	Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).
s10_e08_c08_u248	Grand Supreme Little Darling?
s10_e08_c08_u249	Congratulatioooons!
s10_e08_c08_u250	Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
s10_e08_c08_u251	Really girls, not cool.
s10_e08_c08_u252	Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
s10_e08_c08_u253	Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
s10_e08_c08_u254	It's a day to be thankful.
s10_e08_c08_u255	(to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!
s10_e08_c08_u256	It's too late for apologies.
s10_e08_c08_u257	Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
s10_e08_c08_u258	That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
s10_e08_c08_u259	Ewww, is that what that is?
s10_e08_c08_u260	Sorry!
s10_e08_c08_u261	Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
s10_e08_c08_u262	Yeah! I'll cook!
s10_e08_c08_u263	Yeah! Let's go out.
s10_e08_c08_u264	Hey!
s10_e08_c08_u265	Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
s10_e08_c08_u266	The three of us?
s10_e08_c08_u267	Ha!
s10_e08_c08_u268	Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
s10_e08_c08_u269	Joey, that is not gonna work.
s10_e08_c08_u270	No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
s10_e08_c08_u271	I'll pull you through.
s10_e08_c08_u272	Okay.
s10_e08_c08_u273	(in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
s10_e08_c08_u274	A little late for that.
s10_e08_c08_u275	Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
s10_e08_c08_u276	Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
s10_e08_c08_u277	Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
s10_e08_c08_u278	Bring it.
s10_e08_c08_u279	I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
s10_e08_c08_u280	Here you go!
s10_e08_c08_u281	Oh, that smells good!
s10_e08_c08_u282	Okay.
s10_e08_c08_u283	Okay, try it.
s10_e08_c08_u284	It isn't working.
s10_e08_c08_u285	Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
s10_e08_c08_u286	Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
s10_e08_c08_u287	Can you ever feel your ears?
s10_e08_c08_u288	Interesting...
s10_e08_c08_u289	Chandler, where are your tools?
s10_e08_c08_u290	(sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
s10_e08_c08_u291	I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
s10_e08_c08_u292	I lent them to Ross.
s10_e08_c08_u293	I gave them to Joey.
s10_e08_c08_u294	I left them at the park.
s10_e08_c08_u295	Oh!
s10_e08_c08_u296	(looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
s10_e08_c08_u297	I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
s10_e08_c08_u298	Nice!
s10_e08_c08_u299	Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
s10_e08_c08_u300	It's really starting to hurt.
s10_e08_c08_u301	Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
s10_e08_c08_u302	Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
s10_e08_c08_u303	Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
s10_e08_c08_u304	Come on guys, PUSH!
s10_e08_c08_u305	Yeah! Come on!
s10_e08_c08_u306	PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
s10_e08_c08_u307	My cranberries!
s10_e08_c08_u308	(looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me.
s10_e08_c08_u309	Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
s10_e08_c08_u310	(to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
s10_e08_c08_u311	(very emotional) I don't care.
s10_e08_c08_u312	What's going on?
s10_e08_c08_u313	That was the adoption agency...
s10_e08_c08_u314	And?
s10_e08_c08_u315	WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
s10_e08_c08_u316	Are you serious? (they hug)
s10_e08_c08_u317	There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
s10_e08_c08_u318	I'm so happy for you!
s10_e08_c08_u319	This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
s10_e08_c09_u320	To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
s10_e08_c09_u321	I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
s10_e08_c09_u322	I know. Have you considered pageanting?
s10_e08_c09_u323	I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)
s10_e08_c09_u324	Oh, I know how you feel...
s10_e08_c09_u325	Really?
s10_e08_c09_u326	Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
s08_e21_c01_u001	Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the table.)
s08_e21_c01_u002	Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
s08_e21_c01_u003	No, Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all gasp.) I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)
s08_e21_c01_u004	Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. (Quoting) "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
s08_e21_c01_u005	(entering) Hey!
s08_e21_c01_u006	Hey.
s08_e21_c01_u007	(seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
s08_e21_c01_u008	Umm
s08_e21_c01_u009	(reading) Oh dear God!
s08_e21_c01_u010	But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
s08_e21_c01_u011	What about the rest of Manhattan?!
s08_e21_c01_u012	Yeah, they all know.
s08_e21_c01_u013	Oh my God, this is horrible!
s08_e21_c01_u014	I'm so sorry.
s08_e21_c01_u015	I'm so humiliated!
s08_e21_c01_u016	Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
s08_e21_c01_u017	You don't think that umm, (reading) "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
s08_e21_c01_u018	I didn't write it.
s08_e21_c01_u019	Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?
s08_e21_c01_u020	No!
s08_e21_c01_u021	Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!
s08_e21_c02_u022	Ross!
s08_e21_c02_u023	(startling him) What?! What?
s08_e21_c02_u024	I am freaking out!
s08_e21_c02_u025	Are ya?
s08_e21_c02_u026	My due date is in one week!
s08_e21_c02_u027	What are you doing up?
s08_e21_c02_u028	That is seven days!
s08_e21_c02_u029	Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after
s08_e21_c02_u030	(interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
s08_e21_c02_u031	It's funny you should mention diapers.
s08_e21_c02_u032	I'm serious.
s08_e21_c02_u033	Okay look, there's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
s08_e21_c02_u034	Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little
s08_e21_c02_u035	(interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So- (Starts for the bathroom.)
s08_e21_c02_u036	(stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
s08_e21_c02_u037	(annoyed) Yeah!
s08_e21_c02_u038	Umm, our situation. Y'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?
s08_e21_c02_u039	(stunned) (thinks) Well uh
s08_e21_c02_u040	I'm just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)
s08_e21_c03_u041	(entering) Hey uh Monica, I can't remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
s08_e21_c03_u042	We said at the movies, but
s08_e21_c03_u043	Okay, I'll see you there. (Starts to leave)
s08_e21_c03_u044	Joey! (He returns) Now that you're here
s08_e21_c03_u045	Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What uh-How come you're not going?
s08_e21_c03_u046	I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
s08_e21_c03_u047	I thought you already have a job.
s08_e21_c03_u048	And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
s08_e21_c03_u049	Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
s08_e21_c03_u050	That's what I do now.
s08_e21_c03_u051	Hey Joey, come taste this.
s08_e21_c03_u052	What is it?
s08_e21_c03_u053	Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well- (Feeds him a spoonful of what she's cooking.) I'm getting my revenge!
s08_e21_c03_u054	You cooked him?
s08_e21_c03_u055	No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
s08_e21_c03_u056	The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?
s08_e21_c04_u057	Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
s08_e21_c04_u058	Oh.
s08_e21_c04_u059	Oh.
s08_e21_c04_u060	No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.
s08_e21_c04_u061	We are having a baby together, but we're not involved. (The cashier, a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at him angrily) Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.
s08_e21_c04_u062	Why don't you fill out this address card. (Hands him one.)
s08_e21_c04_u063	Oh, okay.
s08_e21_c04_u064	I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
s08_e21_c04_u065	Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
s08_e21_c04_u066	I chose those, I'm a paleontologist.
s08_e21_c04_u067	Really?! That is so cool!
s08_e21_c04_u068	Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.
s08_e21_c04_u069	Oh no-no, I'm fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?
s08_e21_c04_u070	Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
s08_e21_c04_u071	Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
s08_e21_c04_u072	(looking at the completed address card) Oh, I love your neighborhood. There's a great gym right around the corner from your building.
s08_e21_c04_u073	That's my gym.
s08_e21_c04_u074	I can tell you work out. (Ross is please and Rachel looks at him confused.) A paleontologist who works out, you're like Indiana Jones. (Rachel has a disbelieving look on her face.)
s08_e21_c04_u075	I am like Indiana Jones.
s08_e21_c05_u076	Hi Pheebs!
s08_e21_c05_u077	Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
s08_e21_c05_u078	Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn't on the list. A whore.
s08_e21_c05_u079	What?!
s08_e21_c05_u080	Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
s08_e21_c05_u081	Well did she know you two weren't married?
s08_e21_c05_u082	Yeah.
s08_e21_c05_u083	Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
s08_e21_c05_u084	You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
s08_e21_c05_u085	Sounds like you're a little jealous.
s08_e21_c05_u086	No! I'm not! I-I-I just think it's wrong! It's-it's that I'm-Here I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts R' Us!
s08_e21_c05_u087	Is that a real place? (Rachel's stunned) Are they hiring?
s08_e21_c05_u088	(entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!
s08_e21_c05_u089	Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
s08_e21_c05_u090	Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
s08_e21_c05_u091	Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
s08_e21_c05_u092	Me! I do that. So- Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.
s08_e21_c05_u093	Oh yeah! You really-You look great.
s08_e21_c05_u094	Yeah, just don't get your hopes up.
s08_e21_c05_u095	Why not?
s08_e21_c05_u096	Well, the interview
s08_e21_c05_u097	What about it?
s08_e21_c05_u098	Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.
s08_e21_c05_u099	(shocked) What?!
s08_e21_c05_u100	Oh you don't know.
s08_e21_c05_u101	Are you serious?!
s08_e21_c05_u102	Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
s08_e21_c05_u103	What is it that I do?
s08_e21_c05_u104	Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.
s08_e21_c05_u105	(To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?
s08_e21_c05_u106	Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you. (Gets up and hurries out.)
s08_e21_c06_u107	Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
s08_e21_c06_u108	Still?
s08_e21_c06_u109	I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
s08_e21_c06_u110	I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
s08_e21_c06_u111	Either eat it, or be in it.
s08_e21_c06_u112	Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?
s08_e21_c06_u113	I'm torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. (Throws down the spoon and walks out.)
s08_e21_c06_u114	Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.
s08_e21_c06_u115	Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? (No one can.)
s08_e21_c06_u116	I can.
s08_e21_c06_u117	Okay, go ahead.
s08_e21_c06_u118	Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
s08_e21_c06_u119	That's very good, what's your name?
s08_e21_c06_u120	Monica.
s08_e21_c06_u121	Monica, you go to the head of the class.
s08_e21_c06_u122	Okay. (Does so.)
s08_e21_c07_u123	All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
s08_e21_c07_u124	My son? Pretty serious. (There's a knock on the door and Ross answers it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?
s08_e21_c07_u125	Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (A blanket.)
s08_e21_c07_u126	Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
s08_e21_c07_u127	Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
s08_e21_c07_u128	Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)
s08_e21_c07_u129	Oh uh-I actually came here to ask you out.
s08_e21_c07_u130	Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I'm just gonna put this (The money) back in my pocket, pretend that didn't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or
s08_e21_c07_u131	Sure!
s08_e21_c07_u132	Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs she's holding are arguing.) No! You're a horny bitch! Noooo! You're the horny bitch! No! You're a horny bitch!
s08_e21_c08_u133	So you guys go, have a really good time.
s08_e21_c08_u134	(To Katie) Yeah, I'm just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. (Katie looks worried.) Y'know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not because I'm-I'm into S&M. (Katie's worried again.) I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is uncomfortable.) So, I'm gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel alone.)
s08_e21_c08_u135	So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
s08_e21_c08_u136	Are you okay with this?
s08_e21_c08_u137	Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.
s08_e21_c08_u138	Okay. It was nice to see you.
s08_e21_c08_u139	Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
s08_e21_c08_u140	Oh umm, actually I umm
s08_e21_c08_u141	Oh okay, I see what you're doing there.
s08_e21_c09_u142	I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?
s08_e21_c09_u143	Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
s08_e21_c09_u144	Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
s08_e21_c09_u145	All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
s08_e21_c09_u146	An hour.
s08_e21_c09_u147	I can't help you.
s08_e21_c09_u148	Phoebe!
s08_e21_c09_u149	All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange."
s08_e21_c09_u150	Chandler Bing.
s08_e21_c09_u151	Bing, what an unusual name.
s08_e21_c09_u152	Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I'll let myself out.
s08_e21_c10_u153	Hi.
s08_e21_c10_u154	Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
s08_e21_c10_u155	When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
s08_e21_c10_u156	And the cream?
s08_e21_c10_u157	Cheese makes me thirsty.
s08_e21_c10_u158	Okay. Let's move on.
s08_e21_c10_u159	All right.
s08_e21_c10_u160	(To Monica) Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station! (She tries Monica's fettuccini.) Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?
s08_e21_c10_u161	Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
s08_e21_c10_u162	Well, hats off to the chef.
s08_e21_c10_u163	I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
s08_e21_c10_u164	The chef!
s08_e21_c10_u165	That's right.
s08_e21_c11_u166	I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.
s08_e21_c11_u167	Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.
s08_e21_c11_u168	(suppressing a smile) What I do do-is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
s08_e21_c11_u169	I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
s08_e21_c11_u170	Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
s08_e21_c11_u171	You gotta go!
s08_e21_c11_u172	Oh! (Stands up.)
s08_e21_c11_u173	Okay, don't worry. You're ready.
s08_e21_c11_u174	Really?
s08_e21_c11_u175	Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
s08_e21_c11_u176	Okay.
s08_e21_c12_u177	Ah Monica, my star student.
s08_e21_c12_u178	Y'know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. (Hands it to her.)
s08_e21_c12_u179	(tasting the cookie and with her mouthful) Oh, yum-yum-yum. (Hands the star back.)
s08_e21_c12_u180	Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
s08_e21_c12_u181	Okay Joey, you're up next. (Tries one of his cookies.) This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!
s08_e21_c12_u182	I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I'm a dork.
s08_e21_c12_u183	Joey! I'm so proud of you!
s08_e21_c12_u184	I think you should give him your star.
s08_e21_c12_u185	Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!
s08_e21_c12_u186	We're all beginners here. Nobody knows what they're doing.
s08_e21_c12_u187	I do! I'm a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax! It's not a courtroom drama!
s08_e21_c12_u188	If you're a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?
s08_e21_c12_u189	Yeah!
s08_e21_c12_u190	I'm-I'm sorry, it's just that umm- Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro's, and umm I just got a really bad review
s08_e21_c12_u191	Oh Alessandro's! I love that place!
s08_e21_c12_u192	You do?
s08_e21_c12_u193	Oh yes! You're an excellent chef! As a person you're a little
s08_e21_c12_u194	Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
s08_e21_c12_u195	Very much.
s08_e21_c12_u196	Okay then, I don't stink. I'm a good chef. Okay. (Starts to leave.)
s08_e21_c12_u197	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
s08_e21_c12_u198	Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?
s08_e21_c12_u199	Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go. (Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)
s08_e21_c13_u200	also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
s08_e21_c13_u201	You must've had your hands full.
s08_e21_c13_u202	That I did. That I did.
s08_e21_c13_u203	So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
s08_e21_c13_u204	(nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.
s08_e21_c13_u205	Now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.
s08_e21_c13_u206	(trying not to laugh) I see.
s08_e21_c13_u207	But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
s08_e21_c13_u208	(really try not to laugh) Good to know.
s08_e21_c13_u209	We can go into detail
s08_e21_c13_u210	No don't I beg of you!
s08_e21_c13_u211	All right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.
s08_e21_c13_u212	(relieved) Really?!
s08_e21_c13_u213	Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you did great.
s08_e21_c13_u214	Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn't understand) Duties. (Still doesn't.) Duties! (Still doesn't.) Poo. (Still doesn't.)
s08_e21_c13_u215	Poo?
s08_e21_c13_u216	Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
s08_e21_c13_u217	Poo?!
s08_e21_c13_u218	I'll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)
s08_e21_c14_u219	Hey.
s08_e21_c14_u220	Hi! You're back from your date!
s08_e21_c14_u221	How are you?
s08_e21_c14_u222	I'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she?
s08_e21_c14_u223	Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
s08_e21_c14_u224	Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
s08_e21_c14_u225	What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
s08_e21_c14_u226	No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
s08_e21_c14_u227	I liked her.
s08_e21_c14_u228	Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
s08_e21_c14_u229	Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
s08_e21_c14_u230	No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.
s08_e21_c14_u231	Why? What was wrong with her?
s08_e21_c14_u232	There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
s08_e21_c14_u233	Okay, so what's the matter?
s08_e21_c14_u234	I don't want you to date her!
s08_e21_c14_u235	(laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?
s08_e21_c14_u236	Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
s08_e21_c14_u237	Okay.
s08_e21_c14_u238	What?!
s08_e21_c14_u239	I won't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
s08_e21_c14_u240	Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
s08_e21_c14_u241	True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
s08_e21_c14_u242	(starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)
s08_e21_c14_u243	Do you feel better?
s08_e21_c14_u244	No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)
s08_e21_c14_u245	Uh Rach?
s08_e21_c14_u246	Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)
s08_e21_c14_u247	Just one thing umm
s08_e21_c14_u248	Uh-huh.
s08_e21_c14_u249	We live together. You're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don't want something more?
s08_e21_c14_u250	(pause) Wow! I don't know, maybe. I'm
s08_e21_c14_u251	Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin' around! (She's stunned) Like you did last night when I had to pee?
s08_e21_c14_u252	(laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
s08_e21_c14_u253	(pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you
s08_e21_c14_u254	Oh no-no-no-no, no!
s08_e21_c14_u255	that you actually
s08_e21_c14_u256	No that's just-(Laughs)-That's just cause I'm such a good messer!
s08_e21_c14_u257	Rach?
s08_e21_c14_u258	Yeah?
s08_e21_c14_u259	The bathroom?
s08_e21_c14_u260	Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)
s08_e21_c15_u261	Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.
s08_e21_c15_u262	Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
s08_e21_c15_u263	What the hell!
s08_e21_c15_u264	Okay.
s08_e21_c15_u265	All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
s08_e21_c15_u266	Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)
s04_e11_c01_u001	Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
s04_e11_c01_u002	Oh I know!! (Both he and Alice squeal hysterically)
s04_e11_c01_u003	You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
s04_e11_c01_u004	Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch
s04_e11_c01_u005	Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
s04_e11_c01_u006	We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!
s04_e11_c01_u007	Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
s04_e11_c01_u008	Uhh, yeah.
s04_e11_c01_u009	We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger.
s04_e11_c01_u010	See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive.
s04_e11_c01_u011	And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
s04_e11_c01_u012	Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
s04_e11_c01_u013	(shocked) That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
s04_e11_c02_u014	(entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (He's wearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.
s04_e11_c02_u015	I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
s04_e11_c02_u016	What?
s04_e11_c02_u017	Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
s04_e11_c02_u018	But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
s04_e11_c02_u019	Well, you-you know what I meant.
s04_e11_c02_u020	No, you messed it up. You're stupid.
s04_e11_c02_u021	So what job did you get Joe?
s04_e11_c02_u022	Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
s04_e11_c02_u023	Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
s04_e11_c02_u024	No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
s04_e11_c02_u025	Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period.
s04_e11_c02_u026	Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
s04_e11_c02_u027	(entering) Hey!!
s04_e11_c02_u028	Hey!
s04_e11_c02_u029	Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
s04_e11_c02_u030	Oh my God!!
s04_e11_c02_u031	And! And, they're gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)
s04_e11_c02_u032	My God!
s04_e11_c02_u033	Are you serious?
s04_e11_c02_u034	Yeah
s04_e11_c02_u035	You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
s04_e11_c02_u036	Ewww! And "Oh no!" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
s04_e11_c02_u037	Huh.
s04_e11_c02_u038	What did you tell them?
s04_e11_c02_u039	Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
s04_e11_c02_u040	You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
s04_e11_c02_u041	Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.
s04_e11_c02_u042	Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
s04_e11_c02_u043	I know!
s04_e11_c02_u044	Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
s04_e11_c02_u045	Yeah, what's your point?
s04_e11_c02_u046	Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
s04_e11_c02_u047	Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a-keeper.
s04_e11_c02_u048	Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
s04_e11_c02_u049	No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
s04_e11_c02_u050	Yeah.
s04_e11_c02_u051	We just want you to think it through.
s04_e11_c02_u052	Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?
s04_e11_c02_u053	My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
s04_e11_c03_u054	Umm, (moves her hand's down to his butt) I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?
s04_e11_c03_u055	Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
s04_e11_c03_u056	Oh! (They kiss and she leaves)
s04_e11_c03_u057	I am so jealous.
s04_e11_c03_u058	You guys are really right-there aren't you?
s04_e11_c03_u059	Yes. Right where?
s04_e11_c03_u060	In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and
s04_e11_c03_u061	Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
s04_e11_c03_u062	And the sex?
s04_e11_c03_u063	All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
s04_e11_c03_u064	Oh, Chandler that is so nice.
s04_e11_c03_u065	That is really nice-lying! No way is that the reason!
s04_e11_c03_u066	Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
s04_e11_c03_u067	No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
s04_e11_c03_u068	Then what is it?
s04_e11_c03_u069	Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
s04_e11_c03_u070	And you're afraid you won't be able to-fill his shoes.
s04_e11_c03_u071	No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.
s04_e11_c03_u072	Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
s04_e11_c03_u073	Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
s04_e11_c03_u074	So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
s04_e11_c03_u075	We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
s04_e11_c03_u076	Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.
s04_e11_c03_u077	Yeah?
s04_e11_c03_u078	Yeah!
s04_e11_c03_u079	Just go for it Chandler.
s04_e11_c03_u080	Yeah, you should.
s04_e11_c03_u081	Yeah, you should, really.
s04_e11_c03_u082	Go on.
s04_e11_c03_u083	All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.
s04_e11_c04_u084	Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
s04_e11_c04_u085	Isn't the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?
s04_e11_c04_u086	Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a fossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display cases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. (Ross does the old "Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your mouth trick.") Okay, moving right along. Come on.
s04_e11_c05_u087	It's open! Come in!
s04_e11_c05_u088	Hi!
s04_e11_c05_u089	Hi!
s04_e11_c05_u090	I'm sorry, I'm late.
s04_e11_c05_u091	Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
s04_e11_c05_u092	Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
s04_e11_c05_u093	No, I was working on my pottery.
s04_e11_c05_u094	Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did-pot.
s04_e11_c05_u095	Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
s04_e11_c05_u096	Ooh, erotiery!
s04_e11_c05_u097	Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know
s04_e11_c05_u098	Okay.
s04_e11_c05_u099	I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
s04_e11_c05_u100	Why not?
s04_e11_c05_u101	Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to the couch.)
s04_e11_c05_u102	Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
s04_e11_c05_u103	No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours.
s04_e11_c05_u104	Oh, I get a puppy!!
s04_e11_c05_u105	Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
s04_e11_c05_u106	Why?
s04_e11_c05_u107	I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isn't paying attention and is busy mimicking the puppy.) uhh- Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
s04_e11_c05_u108	Okay.
s04_e11_c05_u109	I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppy again, and not listening) I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
s04_e11_c05_u110	All right, I'm sorry.
s04_e11_c06_u111	Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
s04_e11_c06_u112	You mean Dr. Geller?
s04_e11_c06_u113	Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
s04_e11_c06_u114	Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, (Points to there table) and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
s04_e11_c06_u115	Well, how-how come?
s04_e11_c06_u116	That's just the way it is.
s04_e11_c06_u117	That's crazy.
s04_e11_c06_u118	Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now-(Turns around) Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! (to Joey) See, he pretend he don't even here me!
s04_e11_c06_u119	I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
s04_e11_c06_u120	That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)
s04_e11_c06_u121	Op, this is saved. (Joey wonders why) Gift shop.
s04_e11_c07_u122	(entering) Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
s04_e11_c07_u123	It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
s04_e11_c07_u124	But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
s04_e11_c07_u125	Whatever.
s04_e11_c07_u126	It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
s04_e11_c07_u127	I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
s04_e11_c07_u128	Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. (Leaves)
s04_e11_c07_u129	Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
s04_e11_c08_u130	Hi.
s04_e11_c08_u131	Hey!
s04_e11_c08_u132	Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
s04_e11_c08_u133	Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony.
s04_e11_c08_u134	What?!
s04_e11_c08_u135	Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)
s04_e11_c08_u136	(to Chandler) So, did you do it?
s04_e11_c08_u137	Yes, yes, we had the sex.
s04_e11_c08_u138	Uh-oh, it was bad?
s04_e11_c08_u139	It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
s04_e11_c08_u140	Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
s04_e11_c08_u141	Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.
s04_e11_c08_u142	Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
s04_e11_c08_u143	All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All right. Now
s04_e11_c08_u144	Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!
s04_e11_c08_u145	Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there's more than three), five, six, and seven!
s04_e11_c08_u146	(shocked) There are seven?!
s04_e11_c08_u147	Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.
s04_e11_c08_u148	(Points to one) That's one?
s04_e11_c08_u149	It's kind of an important one!
s04_e11_c08_u150	Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
s04_e11_c08_u151	Well, y'know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could've meant.)
s04_e11_c08_u152	(continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
s04_e11_c08_u153	That-that's bad?
s04_e11_c08_u154	Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
s04_e11_c08_u155	Well you might if it were anything like 7!
s04_e11_c08_u156	All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit em all, and you mix em up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
s04_e11_c08_u157	Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)
s04_e11_c08_u158	All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, -7..-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)
s04_e11_c09_u159	Older Scientist: Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here. (Motions to an empty chair at the white' table.)
s04_e11_c09_u160	Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.
s04_e11_c09_u161	(standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table and they shake hands.)
s04_e11_c09_u162	Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat and throws it down.) I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!
s04_e11_c09_u163	(stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
s04_e11_c09_u164	(standing up and removing his coat) I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
s04_e11_c09_u165	All right, there you go!
s04_e11_c09_u166	Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
s04_e11_c09_u167	Older Scientist: I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.
s04_e11_c09_u168	Okay, good-good for you.
s04_e11_c09_u169	I'm Rhonda, (motions to her breasts) and these aren't real! (Joey and Ross look at each other, shocked)
s04_e11_c09_u170	Wow, Rhonda.
s04_e11_c09_u171	I'm Scott.
s04_e11_c09_u172	Yeah, okay, Scott!
s04_e11_c09_u173	And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
s04_e11_c10_u174	My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No.
s04_e11_c10_u175	Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice.
s04_e11_c10_u176	Y'know, I never saw that.
s04_e11_c10_u177	Ooh, it was only okay.
s04_e11_c10_u178	Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give em-a kidney!
s04_e11_c10_u179	(entering with Frank) Hi!
s04_e11_c10_u180	Hi!
s04_e11_c10_u181	Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so
s04_e11_c10_u182	Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
s04_e11_c10_u183	None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there (points to the counter) having coffee.
s04_e11_c10_u184	Okay.
s04_e11_c10_u185	(noticing the puppy) Oh, who's this little guy?! (Grabs the puppy)
s04_e11_c10_u186	Oh! Ooh! Umm!
s04_e11_c10_u187	Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.
s04_e11_c10_u188	You are so precious, I could just take you home.
s04_e11_c10_u189	Hey, why don't you?
s04_e11_c10_u190	Are you serious?
s04_e11_c10_u191	Uh-huh, yeah!
s04_e11_c10_u192	Oh, thanks.
s04_e11_c10_u193	What are you doing?
s04_e11_c10_u194	No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? Cause look at them, and I made that, so- I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby.
s04_e11_c10_u195	(shocked) Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us! Oh!
s04_e11_c10_u196	Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
s04_e11_c10_u197	It's gonna be so great.
s04_e11_c10_u198	(entering) Hi! What's going on?
s04_e11_c10_u199	Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby.
s04_e11_c10_u200	But Phoebe
s04_e11_c10_u201	No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.
s04_e11_c10_u202	Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it's just-that was my puppy.
s04_e11_c10_u203	Oh!
s04_e11_c11_u204	Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
s04_e11_c11_u205	It depends on who asked.
s04_e11_c11_u206	What if I asked?
s04_e11_c11_u207	Oh, Mon, sure.
s04_e11_c11_u208	Really?
s04_e11_c11_u209	Yes. (Pause) You're not asking are you?
s04_e11_c11_u210	No.
s04_e11_c11_u211	Yes! Totally!
s04_e11_c11_u212	Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you! (Runs back to Chandler)
s05_e13_c01_u001	I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
s05_e13_c01_u002	Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
s05_e13_c01_u003	That was a half an hour?
s05_e13_c01_u004	It's your timer.
s05_e13_c01_u005	Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
s05_e13_c01_u006	All right, then massage me up right nice!
s05_e13_c01_u007	Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
s05_e13_c01_u008	It's so good, isn't it?
s05_e13_c01_u009	It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
s05_e13_c01_u010	Say good-bye to sore muscles!
s05_e13_c01_u011	Good-bye muscles!!
s05_e13_c02_u012	I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
s05_e13_c02_u013	Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
s05_e13_c02_u014	Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
s05_e13_c02_u015	(walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.
s05_e13_c02_u016	Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)
s05_e13_c02_u017	Sorry.
s05_e13_c02_u018	(examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)
s05_e13_c02_u019	(glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.
s05_e13_c02_u020	Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
s05_e13_c02_u021	And you're gonna make them all disappear.
s05_e13_c02_u022	Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
s05_e13_c02_u023	Done.
s05_e13_c02_u024	Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
s05_e13_c02_u025	Great! Thanks, Rach!
s05_e13_c02_u026	Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!
s05_e13_c02_u027	All right.
s05_e13_c02_u028	Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
s05_e13_c02_u029	Hey.
s05_e13_c02_u030	Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
s05_e13_c02_u031	What?
s05_e13_c02_u032	Is everything okay?
s05_e13_c02_u033	Are you all right?
s05_e13_c02_u034	Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
s05_e13_c02_u035	Pheebs! Sorry!
s05_e13_c02_u036	It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
s05_e13_c02_u037	Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
s05_e13_c02_u038	Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
s05_e13_c02_u039	(entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
s05_e13_c02_u040	Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
s05_e13_c02_u041	Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
s05_e13_c02_u042	It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
s05_e13_c02_u043	(to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
s05_e13_c02_u044	Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
s05_e13_c02_u045	Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
s05_e13_c02_u046	It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
s05_e13_c03_u047	Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
s05_e13_c03_u048	All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
s05_e13_c03_u049	Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)
s05_e13_c03_u050	Really? A purse?
s05_e13_c03_u051	It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
s05_e13_c03_u052	It looks like a women's purse.
s05_e13_c03_u053	No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.
s05_e13_c03_u054	See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
s05_e13_c03_u055	Exactly! Unisex!
s05_e13_c03_u056	Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
s05_e13_c03_u057	No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
s05_e13_c03_u058	Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
s05_e13_c04_u059	It's Phoebe.
s05_e13_c04_u060	Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
s05_e13_c04_u061	Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
s05_e13_c04_u062	No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
s05_e13_c04_u063	No you didn't!
s05_e13_c04_u064	Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
s05_e13_c04_u065	Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. (Starts to leave.)
s05_e13_c05_u066	Hey!
s05_e13_c05_u067	Hey!
s05_e13_c05_u068	Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
s05_e13_c05_u069	What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
s05_e13_c05_u070	Your make-up!
s05_e13_c05_u071	(entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
s05_e13_c05_u072	Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts eating.)
s05_e13_c05_u073	Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
s05_e13_c05_u074	Why would I return it? I love this bag!
s05_e13_c05_u075	All right, then you owe me $350.
s05_e13_c05_u076	Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.)
s05_e13_c05_u077	(glaring at him) Joey
s05_e13_c05_u078	All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
s05_e13_c05_u079	What's the part, Anti-man?
s05_e13_c05_u080	Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
s05_e13_c05_u081	U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.)
s05_e13_c06_u082	Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
s05_e13_c06_u083	Hi sweetie!
s05_e13_c06_u084	Hey, how are you holding up?
s05_e13_c06_u085	Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
s05_e13_c06_u086	(notices his bag.) Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
s05_e13_c06_u087	Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)
s05_e13_c06_u088	Thanks!
s05_e13_c06_u089	Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
s05_e13_c06_u090	Yeah, welcome.
s05_e13_c06_u091	Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
s05_e13_c06_u092	So how did you know Francis?
s05_e13_c06_u093	Really?! What's your name?
s05_e13_c06_u094	(Seeing the look on her face) Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
s05_e13_c06_u095	You're Frank Buffay?
s05_e13_c06_u096	Shh! (Whispers) No! Joe Hill!
s05_e13_c06_u097	You just said
s05_e13_c06_u098	Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming. (Hands back his glasses and hurries out.)
s05_e13_c06_u099	But
s05_e13_c06_u100	Oh my God!
s05_e13_c06_u101	What?! What honey?
s05_e13_c06_u102	What happened?
s05_e13_c06_u103	That was my dad!
s05_e13_c06_u104	Oh my God!
s05_e13_c06_u105	(approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me. (Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap him in his face.)
s05_e13_c07_u106	Oh, did you catch him?!
s05_e13_c07_u107	Uh-huh.
s05_e13_c07_u108	Wh-what did he say?!
s05_e13_c07_u109	He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." (They stare at her, dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
s05_e13_c07_u110	Why?! Why not?!
s05_e13_c07_u111	Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
s05_e13_c07_u112	What did you say to him?
s05_e13_c07_u113	Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
s05_e13_c07_u114	All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
s05_e13_c07_u115	Okay.
s05_e13_c07_u116	All right, let's go say good-bye.
s05_e13_c08_u117	(entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
s05_e13_c08_u118	Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
s05_e13_c08_u119	And a date with a man!
s05_e13_c08_u120	Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)
s05_e13_c08_u121	All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
s05_e13_c08_u122	Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
s05_e13_c08_u123	Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
s05_e13_c08_u124	Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! (Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.
s05_e13_c08_u125	Well, at least you scared someone.
s05_e13_c08_u126	Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
s05_e13_c08_u127	Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
s05_e13_c08_u128	All right.
s05_e13_c08_u129	Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
s05_e13_c08_u130	What are you talking about?
s05_e13_c08_u131	As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
s05_e13_c08_u132	(indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She starts giving Chandler a massage.)
s05_e13_c08_u133	(seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
s05_e13_c08_u134	No he's not!
s05_e13_c08_u135	(wincing) Yes, he is!
s05_e13_c08_u136	What?!
s05_e13_c08_u137	I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
s05_e13_c08_u138	You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
s05_e13_c08_u139	Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
s05_e13_c08_u140	But the minute we start to lie to each other- (Pauses after she realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.
s05_e13_c09_u141	Any time you're ready, Joey.
s05_e13_c09_u142	(reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
s05_e13_c09_u143	(stopping him) I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
s05_e13_c09_u144	Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a question.)
s05_e13_c09_u145	Sure. What?
s05_e13_c09_u146	Well, first it's not a purse.
s05_e13_c09_u147	Okay, anytime.
s05_e13_c09_u148	I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
s05_e13_c09_u149	Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
s05_e13_c09_u150	All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
s05_e13_c09_u151	Umm, do you sell these bags?
s05_e13_c09_u152	Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
s05_e13_c09_u153	Okay! Thank you! That was great!
s05_e13_c09_u154	Yeah but I didn't read anything.
s05_e13_c09_u155	I think we've seen enough!
s05_e13_c09_u156	Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the bag.) We got it! We got it!
s05_e13_c10_u157	Hey, is Rachel here?
s05_e13_c10_u158	No.
s05_e13_c10_u159	(coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
s05_e13_c10_u160	Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
s05_e13_c10_u161	(falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.
s05_e13_c10_u162	(starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.
s05_e13_c10_u163	Okay, but now see you're crying!
s05_e13_c10_u164	I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
s05_e13_c10_u165	What?
s05_e13_c10_u166	(bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
s05_e13_c10_u167	It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
s05_e13_c10_u168	Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
s05_e13_c10_u169	Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
s05_e13_c10_u170	I'm crying here!!
s05_e13_c10_u171	Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
s05_e13_c10_u172	Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
s05_e13_c10_u173	Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
s05_e13_c10_u174	So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
s05_e13_c10_u175	Absolutely!
s05_e13_c10_u176	Okay. I suck!
s05_e13_c10_u177	Yeah! (They hug.)
s05_e13_c11_u178	Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
s05_e13_c11_u179	Thank you. All right.
s05_e13_c11_u180	Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on the arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
s05_e13_c11_u181	Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
s05_e13_c11_u182	Okay.
s05_e13_c11_u183	So, what did Francis leave me?
s05_e13_c11_u184	Huh?
s05_e13_c11_u185	Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
s05_e13_c11_u186	Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her purse) this lipstick.
s05_e13_c11_u187	Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's (opens it) oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
s05_e13_c11_u188	Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
s05_e13_c11_u189	Yes, yes I was.
s05_e13_c11_u190	Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
s05_e13_c11_u191	It really says that?!
s05_e13_c11_u192	Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)
s05_e13_c11_u193	Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
s05_e13_c11_u194	Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
s05_e13_c11_u195	Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. (Gets up to leave.) But umm- Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please? (Hands her a note.)
s05_e13_c11_u196	What?!
s05_e13_c11_u197	Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
s05_e13_c11_u198	But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
s05_e13_c11_u199	Yeah, yeah. Why?
s05_e13_c11_u200	Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.)
s05_e13_c11_u201	She what?!
s05_e13_c11_u202	She's dead.
s05_e13_c11_u203	Are you sure?
s05_e13_c11_u204	Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
s05_e13_c11_u205	I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
s05_e13_c11_u206	17 years ago.
s05_e13_c11_u207	Oh! What about, what about the girls?
s05_e13_c11_u208	Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, (pause) is on this couch.
s05_e13_c11_u209	Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
s05_e13_c11_u210	Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, (Sits down next to her and brushes against her leg.) Oops. (He backs up.) I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
s05_e13_c11_u211	Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
s05_e13_c11_u212	So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
s05_e13_c11_u213	Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
s05_e13_c11_u214	All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
s05_e13_c11_u215	That's a defense?
s05_e13_c11_u216	Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
s05_e13_c11_u217	You make up songs?
s05_e13_c11_u218	Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm. (Singing.)
s05_e13_c11_u219	I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm- (Backs away.)
s05_e13_c11_u220	Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)
s05_e13_c11_u221	Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)
s05_e13_c12_u222	(dejected) Hi.
s05_e13_c12_u223	Hey man, how did the audition go?
s05_e13_c12_u224	Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)
s05_e13_c12_u225	What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
s05_e13_c12_u226	Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
s05_e13_c12_u227	What kind of problem?
s05_e13_c12_u228	Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the bag!
s05_e13_c12_u229	Oh my God!
s05_e13_c12_u230	Nooooo!
s05_e13_c12_u231	Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
s05_e13_c12_u232	Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
s05_e13_c12_u233	I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? (She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
s05_e13_c12_u234	Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it- (Looks for help.)
s05_e13_c12_u235	Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)
s05_e13_c12_u236	I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
s05_e13_c12_u237	I can't believe I'm hearing this!
s05_e13_c12_u238	Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause) controversial.
s05_e13_c12_u239	Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
s07_e13_c01_u001	Hey.
s07_e13_c01_u002	Hey.
s07_e13_c01_u003	What are you doing?
s07_e13_c01_u004	Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
s07_e13_c01_u005	(laughs) Why would you want to do that?
s07_e13_c01_u006	So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
s07_e13_c01_u007	Rach, there is a decent place to
s07_e13_c01_u008	And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
s07_e13_c01_u009	No. No. No.
s07_e13_c01_u010	No?
s07_e13_c01_u011	No. Rosita does not move.
s07_e13_c01_u012	I'm sorry, Rosita? As in
s07_e13_c01_u013	As in Rosita does not move.
s07_e13_c01_u014	Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?
s07_e13_c01_u015	The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
s07_e13_c01_u016	Stevie the TV?
s07_e13_c01_u017	(glaring at her) Is there a problem?
s07_e13_c01_u018	No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!
s07_e13_c02_u019	Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That's weird isn't it?
s07_e13_c02_u020	Couldn't I just say, "This is Ross?"
s07_e13_c02_u021	(disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want.
s07_e13_c02_u022	(entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section
s07_e13_c02_u023	Yeah?
s07_e13_c02_u024	Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)
s07_e13_c02_u025	Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is-Oh my God!!
s07_e13_c02_u026	What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
s07_e13_c02_u027	I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
s07_e13_c02_u028	I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
s07_e13_c02_u029	I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
s07_e13_c02_u030	(on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes we're surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?
s07_e13_c02_u031	(knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
s07_e13_c03_u032	Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
s07_e13_c03_u033	I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
s07_e13_c03_u034	Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
s07_e13_c03_u035	(slowly turning and glaring at her) She's not even cold yet!
s07_e13_c03_u036	But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put-your comfort first.
s07_e13_c03_u037	That's true.
s07_e13_c03_u038	(grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?
s07_e13_c03_u039	Yeah, I- (Shuts off the TV.) I don't want Stevie to see her like this.
s07_e13_c04_u040	I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
s07_e13_c04_u041	Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.
s07_e13_c04_u042	They kept your room for a while.
s07_e13_c04_u043	Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!
s07_e13_c04_u044	Come on, you know they love you.
s07_e13_c04_u045	As much as they love you?
s07_e13_c04_u046	I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
s07_e13_c04_u047	(entering) Hey.
s07_e13_c04_u048	Hey.
s07_e13_c04_u049	Hey!
s07_e13_c04_u050	Ugh, I hate this year!
s07_e13_c04_u051	What's wrong with this year?
s07_e13_c04_u052	Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
s07_e13_c04_u053	That was me and Ross.
s07_e13_c04_u054	Oh that's right!
s07_e13_c04_u055	Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
s07_e13_c04_u056	Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
s07_e13_c04_u057	Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much. (Monica and Ross are shocked.)
s07_e13_c04_u058	What?
s07_e13_c04_u059	Oh yeah, like you never called!
s07_e13_c05_u060	So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
s07_e13_c05_u061	Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
s07_e13_c05_u062	(laughs) Why don't we do a trial run.
s07_e13_c05_u063	Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the script.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
s07_e13_c05_u064	I'm the supply manager.
s07_e13_c05_u065	Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
s07_e13_c05_u066	We don't need any toner.
s07_e13_c05_u067	Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the phone.) Yeah you're right, this is easy.
s07_e13_c05_u068	Okay, what was wrong with that call?
s07_e13_c05_u069	Oh well, all right-um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
s07_e13_c05_u070	They're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.
s07_e13_c05_u071	Oh.
s07_e13_c05_u072	So, I think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?
s07_e13_c05_u073	No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
s07_e13_c06_u074	Joey! Joe! (Sees that he's not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! (He decides it's not that important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)
s07_e13_c07_u075	Dad?
s07_e13_c07_u076	I'm here!
s07_e13_c07_u077	(entering with Monica) Hey!
s07_e13_c07_u078	Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
s07_e13_c07_u079	Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.
s07_e13_c07_u080	Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
s07_e13_c07_u081	(To Monica) Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
s07_e13_c07_u082	I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
s07_e13_c07_u083	Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories
s07_e13_c07_u084	Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
s07_e13_c07_u085	I used to love to play restaurant.
s07_e13_c07_u086	Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
s07_e13_c07_u087	Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the attic.)
s07_e13_c07_u088	So, I think you're boxes are over here. (They walk over to them.)
s07_e13_c07_u089	Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?
s07_e13_c07_u090	I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away. (He puts them in his pocket as Ross finds something of interest in one of his boxes.)
s07_e13_c07_u091	Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades) Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym-(He puts it away and finds something else.) Oooh, my rock polisher!
s07_e13_c07_u092	Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!
s07_e13_c07_u093	It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
s07_e13_c07_u094	Well, the white seems to be untouched. (He throws it back into the box as Mr. Geller moves a tarp and makes a discovery.) Uh-oh.
s07_e13_c07_u095	What?
s07_e13_c07_u096	Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
s07_e13_c07_u097	How are you ever going to sell this place?
s07_e13_c07_u098	I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
s07_e13_c07_u099	Oh no. Dad! Dad! What-(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.) Oh God-everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!
s07_e13_c07_u100	You don't secretly smoke do you?
s07_e13_c07_u101	No!
s07_e13_c07_u102	So it's just your mother then.
s07_e13_c08_u103	(on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs. (She's reading from the script.)
s07_e13_c08_u104	I don't need any toner.
s07_e13_c08_u105	I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
s07_e13_c08_u106	Not me.
s07_e13_c08_u107	May I ask why?
s07_e13_c08_u108	You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
s07_e13_c08_u109	I surely do!
s07_e13_c08_u110	Okay, I don't need any toner because I'm going to kill myself.
s07_e13_c08_u111	(doesn't have any luck) Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?
s07_e13_c09_u112	Okay, so-no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.
s07_e13_c09_u113	No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
s07_e13_c09_u114	Well-I only have one thing to do today. (He looks at his board in his office that reads, "Today's Tasks: KILL SELF.") I guess I could push it back.
s07_e13_c09_u115	Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
s07_e13_c09_u116	It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
s07_e13_c09_u117	Chandler?
s07_e13_c09_u118	I-I'm sorry?
s07_e13_c09_u119	No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!
s07_e13_c09_u120	Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. (To the people standing around his cubicle.) Hey everybody! Uh, I'm gonna kill myself! (There's no response; no one even looks up.) I'll get back to ya. (To Phoebe) I got nothing. Wait. (He sets the phone down.) Uh, hey Marge! (Mimes putting a gun to his head, pulling the trigger, and splattering his brain on the wall behind him. Then points to himself. Marge watches this, then goes back to work.) (To Phoebe) Ehh, nothing. Nothing.
s07_e13_c10_u121	My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
s07_e13_c10_u122	You will like it!
s07_e13_c10_u123	No I won't.
s07_e13_c10_u124	You don't even know!
s07_e13_c10_u125	Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!
s07_e13_c10_u126	Well look, if you don't like this-(The audience's laughter at Chandler's progress cuts out the rest of Rachel's line.)
s07_e13_c10_u127	I don't know why you say that so soon.
s07_e13_c10_u128	Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
s07_e13_c10_u129	Francette? What is she? A couch?
s07_e13_c10_u130	Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
s07_e13_c10_u131	Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?
s07_e13_c10_u132	Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back, but it doesn't come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.) She's heeled!
s07_e13_c10_u133	That's weird.
s07_e13_c10_u134	No it's not weird, it's a miracle!
s07_e13_c10_u135	It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
s07_e13_c10_u136	Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
s07_e13_c10_u137	Joey, I really don't
s07_e13_c10_u138	(interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?
s07_e13_c10_u139	Well no.
s07_e13_c10_u140	Miracle!
s07_e13_c10_u141	No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
s07_e13_c10_u142	Someone like an-angel?
s07_e13_c10_u143	That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (She sits down in the chair.)
s07_e13_c10_u144	(angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads for her room.)
s07_e13_c11_u145	Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
s07_e13_c11_u146	Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
s07_e13_c11_u147	Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
s07_e13_c11_u148	Well, can you blame her?
s07_e13_c11_u149	Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could
s07_e13_c11_u150	Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it.
s07_e13_c11_u151	Really?
s07_e13_c11_u152	Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab-grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put em in their.
s07_e13_c11_u153	Great!
s07_e13_c11_u154	Like uh y'know like this! This! (He picks up one of those art projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she could've made this!
s07_e13_c11_u155	Sure!
s07_e13_c11_u156	Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she could've won this!
s07_e13_c11_u157	(grabbing a glove) This could've been hers!
s07_e13_c11_u158	Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
s07_e13_c11_u159	Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
s07_e13_c12_u160	(grabbing a beer out of the chair's fridge) I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
s07_e13_c12_u161	Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)
s07_e13_c12_u162	Hey, how's-how's the uh, miracle chair?
s07_e13_c12_u163	Fine.
s07_e13_c12_u164	Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
s07_e13_c12_u165	No. Really?
s07_e13_c12_u166	Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
s07_e13_c12_u167	(quietly) My chair heels itself.
s07_e13_c13_u168	Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didn't mean him.)
s07_e13_c13_u169	Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
s07_e13_c13_u170	No! That's just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He's the worst! I'd like to take him with me!
s07_e13_c13_u171	All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
s07_e13_c13_u172	(laughs) Yeah! Right!
s07_e13_c13_u173	Oh sorry, boyfriend!
s07_e13_c13_u174	Oh no.
s07_e13_c13_u175	No, whatever! Anything!
s07_e13_c13_u176	Hey guy!
s07_e13_c13_u177	Yeah, he's gotta go.
s07_e13_c13_u178	Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya. (Hangs up.)
s07_e13_c13_u179	No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
s07_e13_c13_u180	(walking by and overhearing that) (to the rest of the staff) The new girl's good.
s07_e13_c14_u181	Hey guys! Hey!
s07_e13_c14_u182	Hey.
s07_e13_c14_u183	Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
s07_e13_c14_u184	(overacting) That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
s07_e13_c14_u185	(overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great memory.
s07_e13_c14_u186	(wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
s07_e13_c14_u187	Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just created for her.)
s07_e13_c14_u188	Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it up.)
s07_e13_c14_u189	Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
s07_e13_c14_u190	(looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
s07_e13_c14_u191	Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)
s07_e13_c14_u192	(holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?
s07_e13_c14_u193	Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
s07_e13_c14_u194	Wow! Look at this! (Picking up a shirt.) I can't believe I even fit into this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads: Tyrannosaurus Ross.) (She turns it around and looks at it.) Oh, this is yours. (Hands it to Ross.)
s07_e13_c14_u195	Oh, I don't know how that got in there.
s07_e13_c14_u196	(holding up a small cowboy hat) This isn't mine. (Sets it down and looks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
s07_e13_c14_u197	Umm, your boxes are umm
s07_e13_c14_u198	What?
s07_e13_c14_u199	Dad?
s07_e13_c14_u200	Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry.
s07_e13_c14_u201	Just mine?
s07_e13_c14_u202	I'm afraid so.
s07_e13_c14_u203	So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
s07_e13_c14_u204	Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
s07_e13_c14_u205	So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
s07_e13_c14_u206	There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
s07_e13_c14_u207	I can't believe this! (Storms out.)
s07_e13_c14_u208	(To Ross) Screw it! I'm having one. (Takes out and lights a cigarette.)
s07_e13_c15_u209	Hey Chandler!
s07_e13_c15_u210	Hey!
s07_e13_c15_u211	How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
s07_e13_c15_u212	Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore.
s07_e13_c15_u213	Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?
s07_e13_c15_u214	(excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
s07_e13_c15_u215	I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actual product by the way, I'm not sure about the 3000 part.)
s07_e13_c15_u216	That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
s07_e13_c15_u217	Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair
s07_e13_c15_u218	Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
s07_e13_c15_u219	Yeah.
s07_e13_c15_u220	I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
s07_e13_c15_u221	Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
s07_e13_c15_u222	Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
s07_e13_c15_u223	Noo! (Laughs) Angels.
s07_e13_c15_u224	I'm gettin' my chair back! (Heads for Joey and Rachel's.)
s07_e13_c15_u225	What? Wh-hey!
s07_e13_c15_u226	Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)
s07_e13_c15_u227	Joey you broke my chair!!
s07_e13_c15_u228	Your chair?!
s07_e13_c15_u229	Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
s07_e13_c15_u230	So, there was no miracle?!
s07_e13_c15_u231	No Joe, no miracle.
s07_e13_c15_u232	(sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
s07_e13_c15_u233	Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!
s07_e13_c15_u234	I think I should get the chair!
s07_e13_c15_u235	How do you figure?
s07_e13_c15_u236	Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!
s07_e13_c15_u237	No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
s07_e13_c15_u238	Well, where's the logic in that?!
s07_e13_c15_u239	The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
s07_e13_c15_u240	So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
s07_e13_c15_u241	That's right!
s07_e13_c15_u242	What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
s07_e13_c15_u243	Yeah! We are!
s07_e13_c15_u244	We're the Cobras!
s07_e13_c16_u245	(to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
s07_e13_c16_u246	Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
s07_e13_c16_u247	(screaming) I'm right here!!!!
s07_e13_c16_u248	(goes over to his desk) Earl! I'm Phoebe.
s07_e13_c16_u249	Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
s07_e13_c16_u250	Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself.
s07_e13_c16_u251	(exhales) Look, um I really appreciate your coming down
s07_e13_c16_u252	No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
s07_e13_c16_u253	Why?!
s07_e13_c16_u254	Because it was fate that made me call you today!
s07_e13_c16_u255	I thought it was toner.
s07_e13_c16_u256	No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
s07_e13_c16_u257	Really?!
s07_e13_c16_u258	Yes.
s07_e13_c16_u259	How?
s07_e13_c16_u260	I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this-this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
s07_e13_c16_u261	Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
s07_e13_c16_u262	No, it's fate!
s07_e13_c16_u263	It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
s07_e13_c16_u264	Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
s07_e13_c16_u265	I'm actually the office manager.
s07_e13_c16_u266	Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
s07_e13_c16_u267	Well, was there anything else?!
s07_e13_c16_u268	Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?
s07_e13_c16_u269	Philadelphia.
s07_e13_c16_u270	Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps. (She holds out her arm.)
s07_e13_c16_u271	(inspecting it) Really?
s07_e13_c16_u272	Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.
s07_e13_c16_u273	Yeah-yeah.
s07_e13_c16_u274	But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!
s07_e13_c16_u275	(To All) Did you hear that?! I don't need you guys to care about me! Because the universe cares! The whole universe! (Laughs as everyone ignores him.) (To Phoebe) I really wished they'd care just a little bit though.
s07_e13_c16_u276	Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, it's you.
s07_e13_c16_u277	Yeah.
s07_e13_c17_u278	Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. (She picks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. (She rubs it against her cheek.) What do you think this is?
s07_e13_c17_u279	All right. I think it was a mouse.
s07_e13_c17_u280	(entering) How are you honey?
s07_e13_c17_u281	How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
s07_e13_c17_u282	Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start. (He hands her a small box.)
s07_e13_c17_u283	(opening it) What's this?
s07_e13_c17_u284	It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
s07_e13_c17_u285	(shocked) What?!
s07_e13_c17_u286	(even more shocked) What?!!!
s07_e13_c17_u287	I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
s07_e13_c17_u288	Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!
s07_e13_c17_u289	Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
s07_e13_c17_u290	(To Monica) Why don't we take it for a spin?
s07_e13_c17_u291	All right!
s07_e13_c17_u292	Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!
s07_e13_c18_u293	Oh yeah.
s07_e13_c18_u294	Ahhhh-.
s07_e13_c18_u295	Ahhh-- (To Rachel) Eh?
s07_e13_c18_u296	Uh-huh.
s07_e13_c18_u297	(entering) Hey guys!
s07_e13_c18_u298	Hey!
s07_e13_c18_u299	Hey!
s07_e13_c18_u300	Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
s07_e13_c18_u301	Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
s07_e13_c18_u302	Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever! (Runs out.)
s03_e14_c01_u001	(singing) Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....
s03_e14_c01_u002	Wow! This girl is good.
s03_e14_c01_u003	Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
s03_e14_c01_u004	I like her.
s03_e14_c01_u005	(to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
s03_e14_c01_u006	Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
s03_e14_c01_u007	(to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.
s03_e14_c01_u008	Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more..(shakes his shoulders, like he's dancing) y'know, and you're more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)
s03_e14_c01_u009	(singing) beside meeeee-eeee-ee. (everyone applauds her).
s03_e14_c01_u010	Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done.
s03_e14_c01_u011	Okay, my next song's called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
s03_e14_c01_u012	Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning' songs.
s03_e14_c02_u013	Hey Phoebe.
s03_e14_c02_u014	Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?
s03_e14_c02_u015	I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
s03_e14_c02_u016	(to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
s03_e14_c02_u017	(to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
s03_e14_c02_u018	Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
s03_e14_c02_u019	(to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?
s03_e14_c02_u020	Ah, yeah, umm. (singing) Home is never far away..
s03_e14_c02_u021	(joining in) Home is Home Star stew.
s03_e14_c02_u022	Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
s03_e14_c02_u023	Hmm, bummer.
s03_e14_c02_u024	Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?
s03_e14_c02_u025	No. But thanks.
s03_e14_c02_u026	Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
s03_e14_c02_u027	Okay. No. But thanks.
s03_e14_c02_u028	Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs. (leaves)
s03_e14_c02_u029	(to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.
s03_e14_c02_u030	Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a tissue, please?
s03_e14_c02_u031	Yeah, sure.
s03_e14_c03_u032	(to Chandler) Someone in there?
s03_e14_c03_u033	No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
s03_e14_c03_u034	Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it's a beautiful woman coming out of the men's room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
s03_e14_c03_u035	Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
s03_e14_c03_u036	(to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.
s03_e14_c03_u037	Ginger.
s03_e14_c03_u038	Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so....
s03_e14_c03_u039	Don't you have to use the bathroom?
s03_e14_c03_u040	Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. (pause) Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)
s03_e14_c03_u041	Someone in here.
s03_e14_c04_u042	Where's Chandler?
s03_e14_c04_u043	Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh! (hides behind the coat rack.)
s03_e14_c04_u044	Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
s03_e14_c04_u045	Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.
s03_e14_c04_u046	Phew, close one.
s03_e14_c05_u047	Hi.
s03_e14_c05_u048	Hi, sweetie!
s03_e14_c05_u049	Hello.
s03_e14_c05_u050	Hi, Ross.
s03_e14_c05_u051	Yeah, huh.
s03_e14_c05_u052	I've got some bad news.
s03_e14_c05_u053	What?
s03_e14_c05_u054	I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
s03_e14_c05_u055	Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
s03_e14_c05_u056	Actually, it's kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
s03_e14_c05_u057	(to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?
s03_e14_c05_u058	Nooo, he's leaving for a better job.
s03_e14_c05_u059	Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachel's desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.
s03_e14_c05_u060	Okay, then.
s03_e14_c05_u061	Okay.
s03_e14_c05_u062	Well we're gonna miss you around here.
s03_e14_c05_u063	Yeah, me too.
s03_e14_c05_u064	So, see ya on Saturday.
s03_e14_c05_u065	Yeah, you bet.
s03_e14_c06_u066	Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the oven)
s03_e14_c06_u067	Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
s03_e14_c06_u068	Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
s03_e14_c06_u069	Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
s03_e14_c06_u070	Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.
s03_e14_c06_u071	Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
s03_e14_c06_u072	You never run on a barge!
s03_e14_c06_u073	(entering) Hey.
s03_e14_c06_u074	Hey.
s03_e14_c06_u075	Is ah, is Chandler around?
s03_e14_c06_u076	No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
s03_e14_c06_u077	Oooh.
s03_e14_c06_u078	Yeah, Ginger something.
s03_e14_c06_u079	Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
s03_e14_c06_u080	No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, (singing) the movie star.'
s03_e14_c06_u081	Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did.
s03_e14_c06_u082	Well, what did you do?
s03_e14_c06_u083	What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life.
s03_e14_c06_u084	Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, (to Phoebe) because it'll be more fun that way.
s03_e14_c06_u085	All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
s03_e14_c06_u086	You gave her food poisoning!?
s03_e14_c06_u087	I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
s03_e14_c06_u088	Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
s03_e14_c06_u089	I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
s03_e14_c06_u090	Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
s03_e14_c06_u091	I ran!!
s03_e14_c07_u092	Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room.
s03_e14_c07_u093	Actually, me too.
s03_e14_c07_u094	(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
s03_e14_c07_u095	Oh damn, I hate that.
s03_e14_c07_u096	Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
s03_e14_c07_u097	Oh, don't worry about it.
s03_e14_c07_u098	No, really you're gonna freeze.
s03_e14_c07_u099	No, I'm not.
s03_e14_c07_u100	You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
s03_e14_c07_u101	Some day, maybe.
s03_e14_c08_u102	Funny book?
s03_e14_c08_u103	Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying I'll see you Saturday.'
s03_e14_c08_u104	Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind.
s03_e14_c08_u105	Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
s03_e14_c08_u106	Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
s03_e14_c08_u107	Oh, well...
s03_e14_c08_u108	Oh my God!!! Ross!!
s03_e14_c08_u109	Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
s03_e14_c08_u110	Because, he's my friend.
s03_e14_c08_u111	Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
s03_e14_c08_u112	Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
s03_e14_c08_u113	Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
s03_e14_c08_u114	I don't know, you thought See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
s03_e14_c08_u115	Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
s03_e14_c08_u116	Really!?
s03_e14_c08_u117	Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
s03_e14_c08_u118	Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?
s03_e14_c08_u119	What should I wear, now I'm all nervous.
s03_e14_c09_u120	Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
s03_e14_c09_u121	It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know.
s03_e14_c09_u122	Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
s03_e14_c09_u123	You think you know me so well.
s03_e14_c09_u124	Well, don't cha wanna?
s03_e14_c09_u125	Yeah.
s03_e14_c09_u126	Okay, well I do know you.
s03_e14_c09_u127	That's what I said.
s03_e14_c09_u128	Well so?
s03_e14_c09_u129	I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives.
s03_e14_c10_u130	(singing) My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don't care what people say. My feet's best friends, pals to the end. With them I'm one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....
s03_e14_c10_u131	(singing) I stepped in something icky.
s03_e14_c10_u132	(singing) Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
s03_e14_c11_u133	We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
s03_e14_c11_u134	(to Rachel) I'm really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm) You're so pretty. I love you.
s03_e14_c11_u135	Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
s03_e14_c12_u136	(singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.
s03_e14_c12_u137	Wow, that's great.
s03_e14_c12_u138	Oh, yeah!
s03_e14_c12_u139	Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
s03_e14_c12_u140	I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.
s03_e14_c12_u141	What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
s03_e14_c12_u142	Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
s03_e14_c12_u143	Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
s03_e14_c12_u144	That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside down to play it.)
s03_e14_c13_u145	....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
s03_e14_c14_u146	(entering) Hi!
s03_e14_c14_u147	Hey.
s03_e14_c14_u148	Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk's gone bad.
s03_e14_c14_u149	Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
s03_e14_c14_u150	So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
s03_e14_c14_u151	Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness.
s03_e14_c14_u152	Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package.
s03_e14_c14_u153	Joey told you about the leg, huh?
s03_e14_c14_u154	Uh-huh.
s03_e14_c14_u155	Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.
s03_e14_c14_u156	(entering from his bedroom) Morning.
s03_e14_c14_u157	(to Monica) Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
s03_e14_c14_u158	(to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
s03_e14_c14_u159	It came up.
s03_e14_c14_u160	Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
s03_e14_c15_u161	(entering) So I nodded off a little.
s03_e14_c15_u162	Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
s03_e14_c15_u163	Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
s03_e14_c15_u164	Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
s03_e14_c15_u165	First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly.
s03_e14_c15_u166	Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
s03_e14_c15_u167	Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.
s03_e14_c15_u168	Oh, that is so...
s03_e14_c15_u169	No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake it off, thinking it's alive and attacking him.)
s03_e14_c15_u170	Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
s03_e14_c15_u171	No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it.
s03_e14_c15_u172	It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
s03_e14_c15_u173	That's a little clearer.
s03_e14_c15_u174	Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
s03_e14_c15_u175	Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)
s03_e14_c16_u176	Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
s03_e14_c16_u177	No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
s03_e14_c16_u178	It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: How much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
s03_e14_c16_u179	No. No. I don't think so.
s03_e14_c16_u180	Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.
s03_e14_c16_u181	What's that?
s03_e14_c16_u182	That's-that's my nubbin.
s03_e14_c16_u183	What's a nubbin?
s03_e14_c16_u184	It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
s03_e14_c16_u185	You have three nipples?
s03_e14_c16_u186	Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?
s03_e14_c16_u187	Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.
s03_e14_c16_u188	You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
s03_e14_c16_u189	Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay. (She leaves and in the hall we see her shake her shoulders like when someone runs their fingernails across a blackboard.)
s03_e14_c17_u190	(to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?
s03_e14_c17_u191	Come here, come here. (they go to the side of the stage) Okay, don't get mad, okay.
s03_e14_c17_u192	Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay
s03_e14_c17_u193	I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
s03_e14_c17_u194	No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
s03_e14_c17_u195	No, no, I don't want to forget it.
s03_e14_c17_u196	Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?
s03_e14_c18_u197	(in the background their singing Smelly Cat) Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
s03_e14_c18_u198	Sorry, Pheebs.
s03_e14_c18_u199	Yeah. You okay?
s03_e14_c18_u200	Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
s03_e14_c18_u201	Yeah.
s03_e14_c18_u202	We'd love too.
s03_e14_c18_u203	Okay. (singing) Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
s03_e14_c19_u204	(entering, happily) Well hello!
s03_e14_c19_u205	Where have you been?
s03_e14_c19_u206	The doctor.
s03_e14_c19_u207	Is everything okay?
s03_e14_c19_u208	Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
s03_e14_c19_u209	Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
s03_e14_c19_u210	What?!!
s03_e14_c19_u211	Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
s03_e07_c01_u001	So I told Carl, Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
s03_e07_c01_u002	I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
s03_e07_c01_u003	Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
s03_e07_c01_u004	If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
s03_e07_c01_u005	What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
s03_e07_c01_u006	Who's singing?
s03_e07_c02_u007	Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
s03_e07_c02_u008	I was always Joanne.
s03_e07_c02_u009	Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
s03_e07_c02_u010	Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
s03_e07_c02_u011	Booo!!
s03_e07_c02_u012	(to Janice) Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
s03_e07_c02_u013	Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
s03_e07_c02_u014	(on TV) Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
s03_e07_c02_u015	What a wank!
s03_e07_c02_u016	Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
s03_e07_c02_u017	I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I'm appalled for you by the way.
s03_e07_c02_u018	(on TV) I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
s03_e07_c03_u019	Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. (listens) Okay bye-bye.' (hangs up)
s03_e07_c03_u020	We?
s03_e07_c03_u021	Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
s03_e07_c03_u022	Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
s03_e07_c03_u023	Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
s03_e07_c03_u024	Please, he refers to me as wethead'.
s03_e07_c03_u025	But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
s03_e07_c03_u026	(leaning in) I'll go.
s03_e07_c03_u027	Fine.
s03_e07_c03_u028	Thank you.
s03_e07_c03_u029	Hi Gunther.
s03_e07_c03_u030	Yeah, we'll see!
s03_e07_c03_u031	(entering) Hey, you guys!
s03_e07_c03_u032	Hey!
s03_e07_c03_u033	Guess what?
s03_e07_c03_u034	What?
s03_e07_c03_u035	I got a gig!
s03_e07_c03_u036	Yay!!
s03_e07_c03_u037	See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
s03_e07_c03_u038	Yeah, I can't say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!
s03_e07_c03_u039	What's the part?
s03_e07_c03_u040	Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
s03_e07_c03_u041	Come on! That's great.
s03_e07_c03_u042	Wow!
s03_e07_c03_u043	Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
s03_e07_c03_u044	Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
s03_e07_c03_u045	(glares at him) I know!
s03_e07_c04_u046	Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
s03_e07_c04_u047	Not at these prices.
s03_e07_c04_u048	(sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the that went right over your head' motion) Woo!
s03_e07_c04_u049	(lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
s03_e07_c04_u050	Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... (hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
s03_e07_c05_u051	Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
s03_e07_c06_u052	Hi!
s03_e07_c06_u053	Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
s03_e07_c06_u054	Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
s03_e07_c06_u055	Ooooh, nice.
s03_e07_c06_u056	Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
s03_e07_c06_u057	Oh, yay!
s03_e07_c06_u058	Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
s03_e07_c06_u059	Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black delievery guy.)
s03_e07_c06_u060	Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. (to Phoebe) You Miss Geller?
s03_e07_c06_u061	Okay.
s03_e07_c06_u062	Sign here. (hands her a clipboard)
s03_e07_c06_u063	Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there. (points to Monica's room)
s03_e07_c06_u064	Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
s03_e07_c06_u065	Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
s03_e07_c06_u066	You want me to lie to Chandler?
s03_e07_c06_u067	Is that a problem?
s03_e07_c06_u068	No.
s03_e07_c06_u069	Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)
s03_e07_c06_u070	Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
s03_e07_c06_u071	Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
s03_e07_c06_u072	Ahh!
s03_e07_c06_u073	Hey now!
s03_e07_c06_u074	Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
s03_e07_c06_u075	Oh! Oh! Oh!
s03_e07_c06_u076	Okay, great.
s03_e07_c06_u077	Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
s03_e07_c06_u078	Okay.
s03_e07_c06_u079	Kay, put your head back.
s03_e07_c06_u080	All right. I can't see.
s03_e07_c06_u081	All right, I have ya. Oh God.
s03_e07_c06_u082	Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
s03_e07_c06_u083	Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
s03_e07_c06_u084	Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.)
s03_e07_c07_u085	Hi Daddy!
s03_e07_c07_u086	This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
s03_e07_c07_u087	You remember Ross.
s03_e07_c07_u088	Um-hmm.
s03_e07_c07_u089	Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
s03_e07_c07_u090	So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green is successful.) (to Ross) How's the library?
s03_e07_c07_u091	Ugh, museum.
s03_e07_c07_u092	What happened to the library?
s03_e07_c07_u093	There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
s03_e07_c07_u094	You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
s03_e07_c07_u095	Yeah, if you're really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a joke, I made a joke.
s03_e07_c07_u096	Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
s03_e07_c07_u097	What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
s03_e07_c07_u098	It's not a library...
s03_e07_c07_u099	(interrupting him) I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I don't know to the waiter.)
s03_e07_c08_u100	So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
s03_e07_c08_u101	They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
s03_e07_c08_u102	It gives it a nice antiquey look.
s03_e07_c08_u103	(he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
s03_e07_c08_u104	Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel giggles at that)
s03_e07_c08_u105	Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
s03_e07_c08_u106	Okay.
s03_e07_c08_u107	Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
s03_e07_c08_u108	Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
s03_e07_c08_u109	Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
s03_e07_c08_u110	Yeah. That's Daddy.
s03_e07_c08_u111	That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
s03_e07_c08_u112	Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
s03_e07_c08_u113	So?
s03_e07_c08_u114	So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
s03_e07_c08_u115	You really serve people sneezers?
s03_e07_c08_u116	Well um, I don't.
s03_e07_c08_u117	You kids ready?
s03_e07_c08_u118	Thanks again, Dr. Green.
s03_e07_c08_u119	All right.
s03_e07_c08_u120	Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
s03_e07_c08_u121	Oh, ah, you don't need that.
s03_e07_c08_u122	Why not?
s03_e07_c08_u123	The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
s03_e07_c08_u124	(gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
s03_e07_c08_u125	Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
s03_e07_c08_u126	Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something about that.
s03_e07_c08_u127	I know.
s03_e07_c08_u128	Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
s03_e07_c08_u129	Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
s03_e07_c08_u130	Nothing I do means anything, really.
s03_e07_c08_u131	This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips up the bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)
s03_e07_c08_u132	Well Mr. Big Shot is better than wethead'.
s03_e07_c09_u133	Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
s03_e07_c09_u134	Hey, Mr. Trib.
s03_e07_c09_u135	Hey-hey.
s03_e07_c09_u136	Guess what, I got an audition!
s03_e07_c09_u137	Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
s03_e07_c09_u138	I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
s03_e07_c09_u139	You bet! What's the part?
s03_e07_c09_u140	Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
s03_e07_c10_u141	You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
s03_e07_c10_u142	Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
s03_e07_c10_u143	Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
s03_e07_c10_u144	Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
s03_e07_c10_u145	Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
s03_e07_c10_u146	I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
s03_e07_c10_u147	Um. yeah.
s03_e07_c10_u148	I am soo dead. (goes to Monica's room)
s03_e07_c10_u149	All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
s03_e07_c10_u150	Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
s03_e07_c10_u151	Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
s03_e07_c10_u152	Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
s03_e07_c10_u153	Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
s03_e07_c10_u154	Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
s03_e07_c10_u155	Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)
s03_e07_c10_u156	Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I'll get the bagels.
s03_e07_c11_u157	(sees the bed) What's this?
s03_e07_c11_u158	Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
s03_e07_c11_u159	This is not the bed I ordered!
s03_e07_c11_u160	I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
s03_e07_c11_u161	Phoebe!
s03_e07_c11_u162	Why is this car in my bedroom?
s03_e07_c11_u163	I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
s03_e07_c11_u164	When did I sign for it?
s03_e07_c11_u165	When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, cause he left his nose open!
s03_e07_c11_u166	Did you make brownies today?
s03_e07_c11_u167	Knock, knock.
s03_e07_c11_u168	(to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
s03_e07_c11_u169	Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
s03_e07_c11_u170	It's Monica's bed. What?
s03_e07_c11_u171	Okay. (to Monica) It's a racecar.
s03_e07_c11_u172	So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
s03_e07_c11_u173	Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
s03_e07_c11_u174	Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.)
s03_e07_c12_u175	Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
s03_e07_c12_u176	Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?
s03_e07_c12_u177	No.
s03_e07_c12_u178	Whoa. That was really good.
s03_e07_c12_u179	Thanks, any suggestions?
s03_e07_c13_u180	You told him to play the boxer gay!!
s03_e07_c13_u181	Well, I-I might've said supergay.
s03_e07_c13_u182	You totally screwed him over.
s03_e07_c13_u183	Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
s03_e07_c13_u184	Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
s03_e07_c13_u185	Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
s03_e07_c14_u186	(opening the door) Hi Daddy.
s03_e07_c14_u187	Baby. Ross.
s03_e07_c14_u188	Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on it.)
s03_e07_c14_u189	Thanks for dinner last night.
s03_e07_c14_u190	Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
s03_e07_c14_u191	Nice hair. What'd ya do? Swim here?
s03_e07_c14_u192	(to Rachel) Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
s03_e07_c14_u193	What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
s03_e07_c14_u194	Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go. (starts to leave rubbing his neck)
s03_e07_c14_u195	What?!
s03_e07_c14_u196	Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
s03_e07_c14_u197	Ross? What's with the neck?
s03_e07_c14_u198	He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
s03_e07_c14_u199	You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
s03_e07_c14_u200	Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
s03_e07_c14_u201	Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
s03_e07_c14_u202	Uh.
s03_e07_c14_u203	Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
s03_e07_c14_u204	Well that's his last name.
s03_e07_c14_u205	And his first name.
s03_e07_c14_u206	He's Bobby Bobby?
s03_e07_c14_u207	It's Robert Bobby.
s03_e07_c14_u208	Oh.
s03_e07_c14_u209	And um, excuse me, he helps me.
s03_e07_c14_u210	Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
s03_e07_c14_u211	What do you need help for?
s03_e07_c14_u212	With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
s03_e07_c14_u213	Oh God!
s03_e07_c14_u214	Argue with that.
s03_e07_c14_u215	What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
s03_e07_c14_u216	Come on! You're just titling! (to Ross) Her legs are fine!
s03_e07_c14_u217	I know that!
s03_e07_c14_u218	So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
s03_e07_c14_u219	I'm sorry, let her?
s03_e07_c14_u220	What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
s03_e07_c14_u221	Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
s03_e07_c14_u222	No.
s03_e07_c14_u223	Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
s03_e07_c14_u224	Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
s03_e07_c14_u225	I'd love some juice. Thanks.
s03_e07_c14_u226	Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
s03_e07_c14_u227	Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
s03_e07_c14_u228	Excellent!
s03_e07_c15_u229	(sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) Thank you.
s03_e07_c16_u230	Uh, may I help you?
s03_e07_c16_u231	Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
s03_e07_c16_u232	Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
s03_e07_c16_u233	All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
s03_e07_c16_u234	Nobody sees the king!
s03_e07_c16_u235	Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)
s03_e07_c16_u236	Hey! You can't go back there!
s03_e07_c16_u237	Oh my God.
s03_e07_c17_u238	Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin'! (honks the bed's little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops) All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
s06_e21_c01_u001	Okay, Chandler!
s06_e21_c01_u002	Okay.
s06_e21_c01_u003	And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
s06_e21_c01_u004	(To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)
s06_e21_c01_u005	Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat.
s06_e21_c01_u006	(To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
s06_e21_c01_u007	Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
s06_e21_c01_u008	(entering) Hey guys!
s06_e21_c01_u009	Hey!!
s06_e21_c01_u010	(ecstatic) Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
s06_e21_c01_u011	Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
s06_e21_c01_u012	Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
s06_e21_c01_u013	No! Joey, you're going to be great!
s06_e21_c01_u014	But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only cause it's right there when you turn it on!
s06_e21_c01_u015	I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
s06_e21_c01_u016	(in a sexy voice to Chandler) I'll be waiting.
s06_e21_c02_u017	Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
s06_e21_c02_u018	No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!
s06_e21_c02_u019	Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
s06_e21_c02_u020	Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
s06_e21_c02_u021	(entering) Hey!
s06_e21_c02_u022	Hey!
s06_e21_c02_u023	Hey!
s06_e21_c02_u024	What are you guys doing later?
s06_e21_c02_u025	Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
s06_e21_c02_u026	(To Phoebe) We do?
s06_e21_c02_u027	I want to see what he wants first.
s06_e21_c02_u028	Okay.
s06_e21_c02_u029	(continuing) I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
s06_e21_c02_u030	Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!
s06_e21_c02_u031	Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
s06_e21_c02_u032	Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
s06_e21_c02_u033	Thanks!
s06_e21_c02_u034	We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
s06_e21_c03_u035	(walking into Mac's office) So uh, here's your office set!
s06_e21_c03_u036	Wow! Huh? (Picks up the phone) Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
s06_e21_c03_u037	(checking his watch) Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.
s06_e21_c03_u038	Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
s06_e21_c03_u039	I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here. (Points to a guy.)
s06_e21_c03_u040	Okay.
s06_e21_c03_u041	Joey Tribbiani, this is
s06_e21_c03_u042	Oh wow! He's so lifelike! (Starts touching the guy's cheeks) Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
s06_e21_c03_u043	This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
s06_e21_c03_u044	(slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)
s06_e21_c03_u045	I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh? (Walks away.)
s06_e21_c03_u046	Okay. Sorry about that-(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.) Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
s06_e21_c03_u047	C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here. (He puts on his headset, picks up the controller, and wheels C.H.E.E.S.E. in. C.H.E.E.S.E. is just a plain old robot on tracks; he kinda looks like No. 5 in the movie Short Circuit.)
s06_e21_c03_u048	(Wayne with a computerized voice) Nice to meet you Mac!
s06_e21_c03_u049	(laughs) This is like the temporary robot, right?
s06_e21_c03_u050	No. Why?
s06_e21_c03_u051	Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.
s06_e21_c03_u052	I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.
s06_e21_c03_u053	I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
s06_e21_c03_u054	It can do this. (He moves C.H.E.E.S.E.'s arm close to Joey's special area and he jumps back.)
s06_e21_c04_u055	This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
s06_e21_c04_u056	It-it's great to meet you Paul.
s06_e21_c04_u057	I usually prefer Elizabeth's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
s06_e21_c04_u058	Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
s06_e21_c04_u059	So Ross, what your problem?
s06_e21_c04_u060	Eh-wh-Excuse me?
s06_e21_c04_u061	Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
s06_e21_c04_u062	That's funny. Umm-. (Pause, then serious) It's not funny.
s06_e21_c04_u063	I don't like you going out with my daughter Ross.
s06_e21_c04_u064	Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
s06_e21_c04_u065	Okay.
s06_e21_c04_u066	What?
s06_e21_c04_u067	Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind. (Ross laughs in relief) You got one minute. (Ross suddenly gets worried.)
s06_e21_c04_u068	Daddy!
s06_e21_c04_u069	Fine! Two minutes. Go.
s06_e21_c04_u070	This is-you-(Ross starts laughing.)
s06_e21_c04_u071	(laughs then checking his watch) 1 minute 50 seconds.
s06_e21_c04_u072	Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. (Paul is not amused.) Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
s06_e21_c04_u073	I'm Irish.
s06_e21_c04_u074	And the Irish guy wins the joke!
s06_e21_c04_u075	Ross!!
s06_e21_c04_u076	Ross!
s06_e21_c04_u077	How crazy that we'd run into you!
s06_e21_c04_u078	Oh God, thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
s06_e21_c04_u079	You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
s06_e21_c04_u080	(obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
s06_e21_c04_u081	There's a Mr. Bing!
s06_e21_c04_u082	No, unfortunately Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.
s06_e21_c04_u083	I get that a lot.
s06_e21_c04_u084	Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees-(He goes to pull out Elizabeth's chair, but Paul steps in)-Yeah, why don't you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)
s06_e21_c04_u085	Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, cause usually he's got the children's hospital.
s06_e21_c04_u086	Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)
s06_e21_c04_u087	So uh, Monica is Ross's sister.
s06_e21_c04_u088	And he's a great brother!
s06_e21_c04_u089	I had a sister.
s06_e21_c04_u090	Ohh!
s06_e21_c04_u091	She passed away.
s06_e21_c04_u092	Oh, you don't have to do that every time.
s06_e21_c04_u093	But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story- (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn't happy.) You're roommate in college died didn't he?
s06_e21_c04_u094	A part of him did yes.
s06_e21_c04_u095	(returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
s06_e21_c04_u096	Yes, we were just
s06_e21_c04_u097	Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?
s06_e21_c04_u098	I'm already here.
s06_e21_c04_u099	Oh! Ross is sooo great!
s06_e21_c05_u100	Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
s06_e21_c05_u101	No, you said the baby creeps you out.
s06_e21_c05_u102	No, the little girl creeps me out.
s06_e21_c05_u103	You said the baby.
s06_e21_c05_u104	Why would the baby creep me out?
s06_e21_c05_u105	Why would the little girl creep you out?
s06_e21_c05_u106	(writing frantically) You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
s06_e21_c05_u107	This is going in your book?
s06_e21_c05_u108	Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
s06_e21_c05_u109	What?! Excuse me!
s06_e21_c05_u110	And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. (Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
s06_e21_c06_u111	(seeing him) Oh hi!
s06_e21_c06_u112	Hi! Hi. (He's looking around.) I think I left my keys here somewhere.
s06_e21_c06_u113	Oh! Well let's look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch cushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
s06_e21_c06_u114	No.
s06_e21_c06_u115	All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)
s06_e21_c06_u116	Oh, here they are right here. (Picks them up from underneath the corner of the couch.)
s06_e21_c06_u117	Oh good.
s06_e21_c06_u118	Thanks for your help. (Starts to leave.)
s06_e21_c06_u119	(chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
s06_e21_c06_u120	Just call me Paul.
s06_e21_c06_u121	Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
s06_e21_c06_u122	Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. (Rachel laughs then starts looking at him.) Are you okay?
s06_e21_c06_u123	You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
s06_e21_c06_u124	Well, we were very young when we had her.
s06_e21_c06_u125	Oh. We?
s06_e21_c06_u126	Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to- (He taps his index fingers together.)
s06_e21_c06_u127	Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a We' or are you just You?'
s06_e21_c06_u128	I'm just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
s06_e21_c06_u129	(sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
s06_e21_c06_u130	Yes I did.
s06_e21_c06_u131	Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!
s06_e21_c07_u132	Hey!
s06_e21_c07_u133	Hey!
s06_e21_c07_u134	Hey!
s06_e21_c07_u135	How was your first day?
s06_e21_c07_u136	Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
s06_e21_c07_u137	Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!
s06_e21_c07_u138	Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
s06_e21_c07_u139	Well, why don't you just get him fired?
s06_e21_c07_u140	I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phone rings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani.
s06_e21_c07_u141	(on the other end) Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
s06_e21_c07_u142	Wow!
s06_e21_c07_u143	The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
s06_e21_c07_u144	I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
s06_e21_c07_u145	Uh-oh!
s06_e21_c08_u146	Joey?!
s06_e21_c08_u147	Hi Ross.
s06_e21_c08_u148	I was just getting him to like you.
s06_e21_c09_u149	Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)
s06_e21_c09_u150	Ross, Joey is not here.
s06_e21_c09_u151	Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
s06_e21_c09_u152	Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
s06_e21_c09_u153	Yeah Ross it's okay, it's me, Mr. Stevens.
s06_e21_c09_u154	(coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
s06_e21_c09_u155	Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach. (Kisses her.)
s06_e21_c09_u156	Bye!
s06_e21_c09_u157	I'll call you later. Bye Ross. (Leaves)
s06_e21_c09_u158	What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
s06_e21_c09_u159	Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them
s06_e21_c09_u160	(incredulous) In your mouth?!
s06_e21_c09_u161	No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
s06_e21_c09_u162	You were at the coffeehouse!
s06_e21_c09_u163	Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
s06_e21_c09_u164	He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!
s06_e21_c09_u165	Wh-You dated my sister!
s06_e21_c09_u166	That was different!
s06_e21_c09_u167	What? Why?!
s06_e21_c09_u168	This is weird for me!
s06_e21_c09_u169	Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
s06_e21_c09_u170	How is that important?
s06_e21_c09_u171	Oh it's important!
s06_e21_c10_u172	Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
s06_e21_c10_u173	Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.
s06_e21_c10_u174	Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
s06_e21_c10_u175	No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
s06_e21_c10_u176	That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but stops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. (Exits.)
s06_e21_c10_u177	So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?
s06_e21_c10_u178	Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
s06_e21_c10_u179	Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
s06_e21_c10_u180	(writing in her book) "You wish."
s06_e21_c10_u181	Phoebe, stop writing about us!
s06_e21_c10_u182	I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
s06_e21_c10_u183	Who?
s06_e21_c10_u184	Marcia and Chester.
s06_e21_c10_u185	Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
s06_e21_c10_u186	Hmm.
s06_e21_c10_u187	(writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
s06_e21_c10_u188	Oh.
s06_e21_c10_u189	I see what you're doing!
s06_e21_c10_u190	(still writing) Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
s06_e21_c10_u191	Oh-oh.
s06_e21_c10_u192	Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
s06_e21_c11_u193	Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! (Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)
s06_e21_c11_u194	Don't touch him!
s06_e21_c11_u195	Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.'s arm and pulls it off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it. Meanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I can't believe it! God! (A very beautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin'? (He and her go over to talk and Wayne looks on with envy.)
s06_e21_c12_u196	So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
s06_e21_c12_u197	What a nice story!
s06_e21_c12_u198	So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
s06_e21_c12_u199	Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
s06_e21_c12_u200	Yeah, take your time.
s06_e21_c12_u201	(to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as
s06_e21_c12_u202	Ross, look, I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, (pause) many stories that Rachel has told me that, well (pause) you're not (pause) all bad.
s06_e21_c12_u203	Not all bad.
s06_e21_c12_u204	And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I (pause) still look at Lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl.
s06_e21_c12_u205	Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
s06_e21_c12_u206	I beg your pardon?
s06_e21_c12_u207	No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
s06_e21_c12_u208	You have a son?
s06_e21_c12_u209	Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! (Realizes) Oh, I'm sorry! (To Elizabeth) It's unbelievable!
s06_e21_c12_u210	Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married. (Rachel returns and hears that.)
s06_e21_c12_u211	Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
s06_e21_c12_u212	You're back.
s06_e21_c12_u213	You two were married?!
s06_e21_c12_u214	Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!
s06_e21_c13_u215	Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
s06_e21_c13_u216	We said seven!
s06_e21_c13_u217	We said six!
s06_e21_c13_u218	The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.
s06_e21_c13_u219	Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"
s06_e21_c13_u220	(Turning around in the chair) Hi!
s06_e21_c13_u221	Oh my good God.
s06_e21_c13_u222	Ugh!
s06_e21_c13_u223	I know what time you said.
s06_e21_c13_u224	What?!
s06_e21_c13_u225	Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
s06_e21_c13_u226	What time?
s06_e21_c13_u227	Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
s06_e21_c13_u228	(disgusted) What does it say?!
s06_e21_c13_u229	I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
s06_e21_c13_u230	Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
s06_e21_c13_u231	Thanks! So are you.
s06_e21_c13_u232	(To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He's wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
s06_e21_c13_u233	(reading from her book) Mon- (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven.
s06_e21_c13_u234	So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
s06_e21_c13_u235	That's right.
s06_e21_c13_u236	Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
s06_e21_c13_u237	(writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
s06_e21_c14_u238	I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
s06_e21_c14_u239	Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
s06_e21_c14_u240	Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
s06_e21_c14_u241	Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
s06_e21_c14_u242	Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)
s06_e21_c14_u243	Hi, how are ya?
s06_e21_c14_u244	Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.
s06_e21_c14_u245	(incredulous) Why should I help you?!
s06_e21_c14_u246	(whispering in Joey's ear) The reason he just said.
s06_e21_c14_u247	(happily) What do you need?
s06_e21_c14_u248	I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?
s06_e21_c14_u249	Yeah?
s06_e21_c14_u250	I wish I could talk to her.
s06_e21_c14_u251	What are you in love with her or something?
s06_e21_c14_u252	Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
s06_e21_c14_u253	Yeah, I've been there my friend.
s06_e21_c14_u254	Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
s06_e21_c14_u255	Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you-(Off Chandler's look)-You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it.
s06_e21_c15_u256	I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
s06_e21_c15_u257	How to make the next one even shorter?
s06_e21_c15_u258	Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. (Everyone looks at her, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)
s06_e21_c15_u259	Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
s06_e21_c15_u260	Y'know what? I-I-I- I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly
s06_e21_c15_u261	Are you yelling at me?!
s06_e21_c15_u262	God no!
s06_e21_c15_u263	Y'know what daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm gonna go out with him anyway.
s06_e21_c15_u264	Really?! (She nods in the affirmative.)
s06_e21_c15_u265	Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! (to Paul) Still not yelling!
s06_e21_c15_u266	Wow. What can I say? (Pause, pointing at Ross) This doesn't make me like you any better!
s06_e21_c15_u267	That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
s06_e21_c15_u268	Then we agree?
s06_e21_c15_u269	Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so.
s06_e21_c15_u270	Neither of us like Ross!
s06_e21_c15_u271	I like Ross.
s06_e21_c15_u272	Ohhh! Kids!
s06_e21_c15_u273	(returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
s06_e21_c15_u274	That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now.
s06_e21_c15_u275	Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
s06_e21_c16_u276	Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
s06_e21_c16_u277	The shipment never made it through Omaha?
s06_e21_c16_u278	You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.'s next line.) It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging it's arms and advancing on Joey behind the desk.) Wayne! Wayne!!
s05_e18_c01_u001	Okay, pick a card.
s05_e18_c01_u002	Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)
s05_e18_c01_u003	All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?
s05_e18_c01_u004	Oh yes.
s05_e18_c01_u005	(holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)
s05_e18_c01_u006	(pause) Yes.
s05_e18_c01_u007	(entering with Ben and Ross) Hey guys!
s05_e18_c01_u008	Hi!
s05_e18_c01_u009	Hi there!
s05_e18_c01_u010	Hi!!
s05_e18_c01_u011	Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
s05_e18_c01_u012	What are you talking about?!
s05_e18_c01_u013	(sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
s05_e18_c01_u014	(reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! (Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
s05_e18_c01_u015	I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings
s05_e18_c01_u016	I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
s05_e18_c01_u017	That.
s05_e18_c02_u018	(entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
s05_e18_c02_u019	Luck!
s05_e18_c02_u020	Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
s05_e18_c02_u021	Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day
s05_e18_c02_u022	Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
s05_e18_c02_u023	Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
s05_e18_c02_u024	Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
s05_e18_c02_u025	Good luck! Go get 'em! (Rachel exits.)
s05_e18_c02_u026	Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
s05_e18_c02_u027	Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
s05_e18_c02_u028	Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
s05_e18_c02_u029	I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
s05_e18_c02_u030	Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
s05_e18_c02_u031	(from the bathroom) Okay!!
s05_e18_c02_u032	Done.
s05_e18_c02_u033	Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
s05_e18_c02_u034	I would love to do it together!
s05_e18_c02_u035	They're gonna do it together.
s05_e18_c02_u036	Dude! That's my girlfriend!
s05_e18_c02_u037	What, so I gotta shut it down now?
s05_e18_c02_u038	All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
s05_e18_c02_u039	It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
s05_e18_c02_u040	Yeah.
s05_e18_c02_u041	Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in agreement.)
s05_e18_c02_u042	Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
s05_e18_c02_u043	Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
s05_e18_c02_u044	Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
s05_e18_c02_u045	You're not his godfather.
s05_e18_c02_u046	What?! Are you kidding?!
s05_e18_c02_u047	(Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather.
s05_e18_c02_u048	All right!
s05_e18_c03_u049	Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
s05_e18_c03_u050	Really? That's great!
s05_e18_c03_u051	I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
s05_e18_c03_u052	(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of Variety to read) Hey, that kid looks familiar.
s05_e18_c03_u053	Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad-.
s05_e18_c03_u054	Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)
s05_e18_c03_u055	That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
s05_e18_c03_u056	Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
s05_e18_c03_u057	I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)
s05_e18_c03_u058	Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
s05_e18_c04_u059	So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
s05_e18_c04_u060	Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On the other one.) Sorry.
s05_e18_c04_u061	Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
s05_e18_c04_u062	She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
s05_e18_c04_u063	(laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.
s05_e18_c04_u064	I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
s05_e18_c04_u065	(at the door) Rachel? Do you smoke?
s05_e18_c04_u066	Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories-(stops and tries to change directions)-about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
s05_e18_c05_u067	and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
s05_e18_c05_u068	That doesn't seem fair.
s05_e18_c05_u069	I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
s05_e18_c05_u070	Yeah, it is the best.
s05_e18_c05_u071	I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
s05_e18_c05_u072	Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
s05_e18_c05_u073	Yeah, I can do that.
s05_e18_c05_u074	Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
s05_e18_c05_u075	(entering) Hey!
s05_e18_c05_u076	Hey!
s05_e18_c05_u077	Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
s05_e18_c05_u078	I would love to!
s05_e18_c05_u079	Oh good!
s05_e18_c05_u080	Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
s05_e18_c05_u081	Oh good.
s05_e18_c05_u082	Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)
s05_e18_c05_u083	Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)
s05_e18_c05_u084	Oh, look at that.
s05_e18_c05_u085	All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
s05_e18_c05_u086	What happened to the intimate dinner party?
s05_e18_c05_u087	Oh, we're not doing that. Okay
s05_e18_c05_u088	So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
s05_e18_c05_u089	What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
s05_e18_c05_u090	Like what?
s05_e18_c05_u091	(Thinks) Cups.
s05_e18_c05_u092	Cups? You're giving me cups?
s05_e18_c05_u093	And ice!
s05_e18_c05_u094	Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of something) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
s05_e18_c05_u095	Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant
s05_e18_c05_u096	I got it! Mine!
s05_e18_c05_u097	(entering, downtrodden) Hi.
s05_e18_c05_u098	Hey! How'd the audition go?!
s05_e18_c05_u099	Not so good.
s05_e18_c05_u100	Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) "Audition didn't go so well. (Happily) Yeah it did?"
s05_e18_c05_u101	(Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
s05_e18_c05_u102	(also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
s05_e18_c05_u103	You got a callback too didn't you?
s05_e18_c05_u104	(Happily) Yeah I did!
s05_e18_c06_u105	Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
s05_e18_c06_u106	Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
s05_e18_c06_u107	Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
s05_e18_c06_u108	Oh great!
s05_e18_c06_u109	So anyway we really- (Someone exhales and Rachel turns and coughs.) Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
s05_e18_c06_u110	Oh, sorry!
s05_e18_c06_u111	Oh that's okay.
s05_e18_c06_u112	No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. (They walk away.)
s05_e18_c06_u113	So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
s05_e18_c06_u114	Oh that's great! You are the best!
s05_e18_c06_u115	Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know what, actually- (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
s05_e18_c06_u116	I thought you didn't smoke.
s05_e18_c06_u117	Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
s05_e18_c06_u118	We get high.
s05_e18_c06_u119	Oh, me too.
s05_e18_c06_u120	I'm kidding.
s05_e18_c06_u121	(Laughs) Oh, me too.
s05_e18_c07_u122	Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
s05_e18_c07_u123	Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
s05_e18_c07_u124	Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
s05_e18_c07_u125	Who knows?
s05_e18_c07_u126	(entering) Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
s05_e18_c07_u127	Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long! Later!
s05_e18_c07_u128	Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
s05_e18_c07_u129	Yeah!
s05_e18_c07_u130	Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two (Points to Joey and Raymond) or you two. (Points to Kyle and Ben.) (Exits.)
s05_e18_c07_u131	Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
s05_e18_c07_u132	Yeah, it is.
s05_e18_c07_u133	No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
s05_e18_c08_u134	(entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!
s05_e18_c08_u135	Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
s05_e18_c08_u136	Ah sure. What's in 'em?
s05_e18_c08_u137	Umm, cups.
s05_e18_c08_u138	Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
s05_e18_c08_u139	Seriously that's a lot of cups.
s05_e18_c08_u140	Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
s05_e18_c08_u141	Y'know I rued the day once-didn't get a whole lot else done.
s05_e18_c08_u142	Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!
s05_e18_c08_u143	Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!
s05_e18_c08_u144	Hey!
s05_e18_c08_u145	Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
s05_e18_c08_u146	What's up?
s05_e18_c08_u147	Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
s05_e18_c08_u148	Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
s05_e18_c08_u149	That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
s05_e18_c08_u150	Well, you just
s05_e18_c08_u151	I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
s05_e18_c08_u152	What?!
s05_e18_c08_u153	What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
s05_e18_c08_u154	(shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)
s05_e18_c08_u155	Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
s05_e18_c08_u156	At least I care about his feelings!
s05_e18_c08_u157	What?!
s05_e18_c08_u158	Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
s05_e18_c08_u159	And why wouldn't he get it?
s05_e18_c08_u160	Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
s05_e18_c08_u161	Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
s05_e18_c08_u162	You just give him a spoon baby!
s05_e18_c08_u163	Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
s05_e18_c08_u164	Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
s05_e18_c08_u165	You're kid's name is Raymond!
s05_e18_c08_u166	Yeah?! So's yours!
s05_e18_c09_u167	(To Rachel) How did work go?
s05_e18_c09_u168	Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
s05_e18_c09_u169	You stink!
s05_e18_c09_u170	Thanks!
s05_e18_c09_u171	No, I'm-I'm serious!
s05_e18_c09_u172	Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
s05_e18_c09_u173	Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
s05_e18_c09_u174	I did not!
s05_e18_c09_u175	Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
s05_e18_c09_u176	All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
s05_e18_c09_u177	I wish I had smoked for my career
s05_e18_c09_u178	That's so gross!
s05_e18_c09_u179	No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
s05_e18_c09_u180	Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
s05_e18_c09_u181	Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)
s05_e18_c09_u182	I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)
s05_e18_c10_u183	So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
s05_e18_c10_u184	Absolutely!
s05_e18_c10_u185	I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
s05_e18_c10_u186	Rachel didn't you just light that?
s05_e18_c10_u187	Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.
s05_e18_c10_u188	I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
s05_e18_c10_u189	Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like (Mimics chain smoking.)
s05_e18_c10_u190	Tell me about it!
s05_e18_c10_u191	Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
s05_e18_c10_u192	It does sound appealing.
s05_e18_c10_u193	Oh, I never could do it.
s05_e18_c10_u194	Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
s05_e18_c10_u195	Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
s05_e18_c10_u196	Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)
s05_e18_c10_u197	My late husband gave me that lighter. (Rachel laughs.) I'm not kidding.
s05_e18_c10_u198	Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's lighter.)
s05_e18_c11_u199	Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!
s05_e18_c11_u200	Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
s05_e18_c11_u201	Oh yeah, no problem.
s05_e18_c11_u202	Thanks. (Exits.)
s05_e18_c11_u203	(goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
s05_e18_c11_u204	(entering, angrily) Joey!
s05_e18_c11_u205	(angrily) Ross!
s05_e18_c11_u206	(angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!
s05_e18_c11_u207	(entering) Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
s05_e18_c11_u208	Hi!
s05_e18_c11_u209	Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready. (Some dude puts down a couple bowls of soup in front of them.)
s05_e18_c11_u210	Uh-oh.
s05_e18_c11_u211	Is there a problem?
s05_e18_c11_u212	Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
s05_e18_c11_u213	Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
s05_e18_c11_u214	Oh, what did I say?
s05_e18_c11_u215	Hmm, noodle soup.
s05_e18_c11_u216	How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!
s05_e18_c11_u217	All right, let's try one.
s05_e18_c11_u218	Hmm, noodle soup.
s05_e18_c11_u219	Okay. Let's do it again.
s05_e18_c11_u220	Okay.
s05_e18_c11_u221	Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
s05_e18_c11_u222	COME ON!!!!
s05_e18_c11_u223	Y'know what? We need to move on.
s05_e18_c11_u224	No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful) Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)
s05_e18_c12_u225	Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
s05_e18_c12_u226	Uh-oh, busted!
s05_e18_c12_u227	Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
s05_e18_c12_u228	Yeah. That didn't work out.
s05_e18_c12_u229	Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
s05_e18_c12_u230	Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
s05_e18_c12_u231	No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
s05_e18_c12_u232	Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
s05_e18_c12_u233	Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
s05_e18_c12_u234	Okay. (Starts to walk away.)
s05_e18_c12_u235	(to Nancy) So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
s05_e18_c12_u236	(hearing that) Oh man!
s05_e18_c13_u237	(To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)
s05_e18_c13_u238	Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
s05_e18_c13_u239	(overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!
s05_e18_c13_u240	(following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!
s05_e18_c13_u241	Awesome!
s05_e18_c13_u242	Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
s05_e18_c13_u243	There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
s05_e18_c13_u244	Y'know-go! Go! Right there! (Points)
s05_e18_c13_u245	Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)
s05_e18_c13_u246	(noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!
s05_e18_c13_u247	Surprise!!
s05_e18_c13_u248	What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
s05_e18_c13_u249	That's the surprise!
s05_e18_c13_u250	Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
s05_e18_c13_u251	Surprise!
s05_e18_c13_u252	Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
s05_e18_c13_u253	I was in charge of cups.
s05_e18_c13_u254	Oh, okay, not so weird.
s05_e18_c13_u255	Hey!
s05_e18_c13_u256	Hey.
s05_e18_c13_u257	Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
s05_e18_c13_u258	Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
s05_e18_c13_u259	No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
s05_e18_c13_u260	Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." (Nods his head in disgust.)
s05_e18_c13_u261	Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
s05_e18_c13_u262	What you do mean?
s05_e18_c13_u263	I think, sub-consciously
s05_e18_c13_u264	Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
s05_e18_c13_u265	(pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
s05_e18_c13_u266	Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor
s05_e18_c13_u267	No!
s05_e18_c13_u268	No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
s05_e18_c13_u269	There you go. Thank you!
s05_e18_c13_u270	Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
s05_e18_c13_u271	No.
s05_e18_c13_u272	Eh, what are you gonna do?
s05_e18_c14_u273	(to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
s05_e18_c14_u274	Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
s05_e18_c14_u275	Okay, great.
s05_e18_c14_u276	(to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette) whole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would be enough (Closer) to get a take on the trip (Still closer) and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!" (She's interrupted by Chandler who has reached his goal and takes a drag from her cancer stick.)
s05_e18_c14_u277	I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)
s08_e20_c01_u001	(entering) Hi!
s08_e20_c01_u002	Hey!
s08_e20_c01_u003	Hey!
s08_e20_c01_u004	So what's the final head count on my baby shower?
s08_e20_c01_u005	About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
s08_e20_c01_u006	Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
s08_e20_c01_u007	What?! You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and there's no booze?! That's shocking! I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
s08_e20_c01_u008	Oh my God, your mother!
s08_e20_c01_u009	What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
s08_e20_c01_u010	Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
s08_e20_c01_u011	My God!
s08_e20_c01_u012	Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
s08_e20_c01_u013	Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people
s08_e20_c01_u014	(interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!
s08_e20_c01_u015	So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
s08_e20_c01_u016	No. (Pause) Neither is mine.
s08_e20_c01_u017	Okay, y'know what? Don't worry, okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her. Just go home and get ready.
s08_e20_c01_u018	Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!
s08_e20_c01_u019	I know. I know, what's her number?
s08_e20_c01_u020	I don't know.
s08_e20_c01_u021	Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs. Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If you're in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her-Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.
s08_e20_c01_u022	Oh, hello Monica.
s08_e20_c01_u023	(on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
s08_e20_c01_u024	I know, my daughter's told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
s08_e20_c01_u025	Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
s08_e20_c01_u026	For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
s08_e20_c01_u027	(To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four.
s08_e20_c01_u028	Well all right. I'll see you at four.
s08_e20_c01_u029	Thank you. (Hangs up.)
s08_e20_c01_u030	Isn't it at three?
s08_e20_c01_u031	Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)
s08_e20_c02_u032	Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
s08_e20_c02_u033	Oh no, I can't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
s08_e20_c02_u034	Oh cool!
s08_e20_c02_u035	That's great.
s08_e20_c02_u036	Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I'll (In a sexy voice) Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be (In an announcer's voice) Joey Trrrribbiani!
s08_e20_c02_u037	You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
s08_e20_c02_u038	But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
s08_e20_c02_u039	Well do you want some help?
s08_e20_c02_u040	Oh really? That'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
s08_e20_c02_u041	Awesome!
s08_e20_c02_u042	Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
s08_e20_c02_u043	(announcer voice) All right! Let's play Bamboozled!
s08_e20_c02_u044	Bamboozled?
s08_e20_c02_u045	Yeah, isn't that a cool name?
s08_e20_c02_u046	(simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!
s08_e20_c02_u047	(simultaneously with Ross) No!
s08_e20_c02_u048	All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
s08_e20_c02_u049	Well uh, I-I'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh
s08_e20_c02_u050	I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
s08_e20_c02_u051	Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)
s08_e20_c02_u052	Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
s08_e20_c02_u053	Bogota.
s08_e20_c02_u054	It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
s08_e20_c02_u055	What does a Wicked Wango card do?
s08_e20_c02_u056	I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
s08_e20_c02_u057	Higher or lower than what?
s08_e20_c02_u058	This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)
s08_e20_c02_u059	(To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?
s08_e20_c02_u060	I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
s08_e20_c03_u061	Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?
s08_e20_c03_u062	You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
s08_e20_c03_u063	What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi Mrs. Green!
s08_e20_c03_u064	Hi!
s08_e20_c03_u065	I'm so glad you could make it.
s08_e20_c03_u066	Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
s08_e20_c03_u067	Try. There's my little girl. (Goes over to Rachel.)
s08_e20_c03_u068	She's still mad.
s08_e20_c03_u069	Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
s08_e20_c03_u070	Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
s08_e20_c03_u071	No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
s08_e20_c03_u072	Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.
s08_e20_c03_u073	Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn't know better I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let's get some tea.
s08_e20_c03_u074	Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
s08_e20_c03_u075	Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don't want you to use your housekeeper cause it would just split her focus.
s08_e20_c03_u076	Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
s08_e20_c03_u077	It's like you're a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don't know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.
s08_e20_c03_u078	Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think that's your mother's crazy.)
s08_e20_c03_u079	Such a sweet woman.
s08_e20_c03_u080	Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
s08_e20_c03_u081	Oh Rachel!
s08_e20_c03_u082	What?
s08_e20_c03_u083	I just had the greatest idea! I'm gonna come live with you!
s08_e20_c03_u084	Wh-wh-what? What?
s08_e20_c03_u085	Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.
s08_e20_c03_u086	Yes. Yes I do.
s08_e20_c04_u087	All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
s08_e20_c04_u088	The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I'll take another question.
s08_e20_c04_u089	Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
s08_e20_c04_u090	It's okay, I'm ready.
s08_e20_c04_u091	No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.
s08_e20_c04_u092	This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath- (Ross cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)
s08_e20_c04_u093	Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris-Holy cow, that's a big word. Trisc- Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
s08_e20_c04_u094	Let me see that.
s08_e20_c04_u095	This one right here. (Ross whines.)
s08_e20_c04_u096	Triscadecaphobia.
s08_e20_c04_u097	(exhaling) The fear of Triscuts!
s08_e20_c04_u098	No! No, fear of the number 13.
s08_e20_c04_u099	Fear of Triscuts?
s08_e20_c04_u100	It's possible, they have really sharp edges.
s08_e20_c04_u101	All right Chandler, you're up.
s08_e20_c04_u102	Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
s08_e20_c04_u103	This game makes no sense!
s08_e20_c04_u104	Y'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
s08_e20_c04_u105	Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.
s08_e20_c04_u106	All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
s08_e20_c04_u107	Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
s08_e20_c04_u108	You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
s08_e20_c04_u109	Either, it makes no difference.
s08_e20_c04_u110	Choose, you jackass!
s08_e20_c04_u111	I'll take a card.
s08_e20_c04_u112	Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!
s08_e20_c04_u113	What?!
s08_e20_c04_u114	This game is kinda fun.
s08_e20_c04_u115	(To Chandler) You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you
s08_e20_c04_u116	I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
s08_e20_c05_u117	Why did you invite my mother?!
s08_e20_c05_u118	What?
s08_e20_c05_u119	She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
s08_e20_c05_u120	For how long?
s08_e20_c05_u121	Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
s08_e20_c05_u122	I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
s08_e20_c05_u123	She can't hear you.
s08_e20_c05_u124	What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
s08_e20_c05_u125	Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
s08_e20_c05_u126	You're right. You're right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
s08_e20_c05_u127	That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
s08_e20_c05_u128	Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)
s08_e20_c05_u129	(To Phoebe) This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel! Y'know what? And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
s08_e20_c05_u130	I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
s08_e20_c05_u131	Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. And in the world!
s08_e20_c05_u132	Well uh, I don't have a gift because I wasn't invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone's attention.
s08_e20_c05_u133	How about you less important people, let's open your presents!
s08_e20_c05_u134	Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
s08_e20_c05_u135	Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
s08_e20_c05_u136	Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
s08_e20_c05_u137	Sweetheart I know you're gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
s08_e20_c05_u138	But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
s08_e20_c05_u139	Really? Remember Twinkles?
s08_e20_c05_u140	He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
s08_e20_c05_u141	Okay, come on Rach it's present time! Y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together. It's kinda falling apart here.
s08_e20_c05_u142	Oh look.
s08_e20_c05_u143	Wow!
s08_e20_c05_u144	Okay, this is from your friend at work.
s08_e20_c05_u145	Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (She's holding an item with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and bottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can't be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
s08_e20_c05_u146	Darling, that's a breast pump!
s08_e20_c05_u147	Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?
s08_e20_c05_u148	It's a diaper genie.
s08_e20_c05_u149	Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
s08_e20_c05_u150	No! It's where you put the dirty ones!
s08_e20_c05_u151	Well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
s08_e20_c05_u152	Oh you're gonna do that ten times a day?
s08_e20_c05_u153	What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
s08_e20_c05_u154	No dear, that's what babies do.
s08_e20_c05_u155	Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
s08_e20_c05_u156	Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you're trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
s08_e20_c05_u157	I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? (Everyone gasps.) What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!
s08_e20_c05_u158	You can't leave a baby alone!
s08_e20_c05_u159	Oh come-(Stutters)-Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would-she wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y'know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
s08_e20_c05_u160	It's actually a bassinet.
s08_e20_c05_u161	Okay mommy, don't ever leave me. (Hugs her.)
s08_e20_c06_u162	(To Chandler) In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!"
s08_e20_c06_u163	Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
s08_e20_c06_u164	Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!
s08_e20_c06_u165	Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
s08_e20_c06_u166	Yes!
s08_e20_c06_u167	I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
s08_e20_c06_u168	Wise choice, how many rungs?
s08_e20_c06_u169	Six!
s08_e20_c06_u170	(makes a sound like a monkey) That noise can only me one thing.
s08_e20_c06_u171	(disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.
s08_e20_c06_u172	(excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler) Haaa! (To Joey) I'd like a Wicked Wango card!
s08_e20_c06_u173	Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song. (Starts humming the theme to I Dream of Genie.)
s08_e20_c06_u174	(thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
s08_e20_c06_u175	Tell it to the Time Turtle!
s08_e20_c06_u176	Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
s08_e20_c06_u177	Yes! Yes, you're back in the lead!
s08_e20_c06_u178	I'd like to spin the wheel!
s08_e20_c06_u179	(annoyed) Oh come on!!
s08_e20_c06_u180	All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
s08_e20_c06_u181	Is there a hopping bonus?
s08_e20_c06_u182	Of course!
s08_e20_c06_u183	Who invented bifocals?
s08_e20_c06_u184	Ben Franklin.
s08_e20_c06_u185	Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
s08_e20_c06_u186	Queen Victoria.
s08_e20_c06_u187	Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
s08_e20_c06_u188	Noooo!!! Every time!!!
s08_e20_c06_u189	Now, over to Chandler.
s08_e20_c06_u190	I'd like a Google Card.
s08_e20_c06_u191	Are you sure?
s08_e20_c06_u192	Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!
s08_e20_c06_u193	Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!
s08_e20_c06_u194	Nooo!!
s08_e20_c06_u195	Yeah!!
s08_e20_c06_u196	This is the best game ever!!!
s08_e20_c07_u197	So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
s08_e20_c07_u198	Of course I am!
s08_e20_c07_u199	Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot. I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby's coming and I don't know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
s08_e20_c07_u200	No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine. (Starts to get up.)
s08_e20_c07_u201	Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
s08_e20_c07_u202	I'm going to the bathroom.
s08_e20_c07_u203	Okay.
s08_e20_c07_u204	Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay. (Hugs Rachel while she is standing and Rachel is sitting, seeing this Monica decides to join in on the hugging by hugging Mrs. Green from behind her back.)
s08_e20_c07_u205	It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder and glares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot.
s08_e20_c07_u206	(entering, out of breath) Hey!
s08_e20_c07_u207	Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
s08_e20_c07_u208	I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at him.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
s08_e20_c07_u209	Not if you were here.
s08_e20_c07_u210	Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
s08_e20_c07_u211	Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
s08_e20_c07_u212	(excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
s08_e20_c07_u213	No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
s08_e20_c07_u214	Uh, what?
s08_e20_c07_u215	Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that Ross isn't happy.)
s08_e20_c07_u216	What-You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy.
s08_e20_c07_u217	(entering from bathroom) Hi Ross!
s08_e20_c07_u218	Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
s08_e20_c08_u219	Hey Joey, hi! I'm Ray; I'm the producer of the show.
s08_e20_c08_u220	(announcer voice) It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
s08_e20_c08_u221	And this is Duncan (points to the cameraman) and Erin, they're gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let's get the camera rolling.
s08_e20_c08_u222	(announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!
s08_e20_c08_u223	Whenever you're ready.
s08_e20_c08_u224	(to the camera) Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
s08_e20_c08_u225	Wayne Gretzky.
s08_e20_c08_u226	Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
s08_e20_c08_u227	Uh Joey, didn't your agents give you the revised rules? We've eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
s08_e20_c08_u228	What-Why?!
s08_e20_c08_u229	Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it.
s08_e20_c08_u230	Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
s08_e20_c08_u231	Yeah all that's gone. It's basically just a simple question and answer game now.
s08_e20_c08_u232	Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
s08_e20_c08_u233	Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
s08_e20_c08_u234	(announcer voice to the camera) Let's play Bamboozled!
s08_e20_c09_u235	and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.
s08_e20_c09_u236	Well we-we don't have a garage.
s08_e20_c09_u237	Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
s08_e20_c09_u238	Y'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
s08_e20_c09_u239	Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
s08_e20_c09_u240	I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
s08_e20_c09_u241	I'm-I'm sure that's not true.
s08_e20_c09_u242	Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
s08_e20_c09_u243	No, not a thing.
s08_e20_c09_u244	It's frightening.
s08_e20_c09_u245	Well uh, y'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
s08_e20_c09_u246	That's true. You do have another child.
s08_e20_c09_u247	Yeah.
s08_e20_c09_u248	With another woman. Have you no control Ross?
s08_e20_c09_u249	That's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to-to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
s08_e20_c09_u250	Well then you really don't need me to live with you.
s08_e20_c09_u251	Yes! Yes, you're gonna be so missed.
s08_e20_c09_u252	You're gonna be a great father.
s08_e20_c09_u253	Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)
s08_e20_c09_u254	Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
s08_e20_c09_u255	Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you're gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn't believe that.) Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?
s08_e20_c09_u256	I hope you're going somewhere with this.
s08_e20_c09_u257	Look at you! What-You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
s08_e20_c09_u258	Really?
s08_e20_c09_u259	I'm telling you.
s08_e20_c09_u260	Thank you. (Hugs him.)
s08_e20_c09_u261	All right you two, I'm gonna get going.
s08_e20_c09_u262	Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)
s08_e20_c09_u263	Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here, which I almost wasn't.
s08_e20_c09_u264	(laughs) You're still so funny. You're so funny. (To Phoebe) What do I do?
s08_e20_c09_u265	Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.
s08_e20_c09_u266	Y'know what? You're-you're right.
s08_e20_c09_u267	Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.
s08_e20_c09_u268	Really?
s08_e20_c09_u269	Uh-huh!
s08_e20_c09_u270	Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica follows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!
s08_e20_c09_u271	Spiteful?!
s08_e20_c09_u272	That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady-old lady-lady!
s08_e20_c09_u273	(To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up
s08_e20_c09_u274	So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunned Mrs. Green.) I can't feel my legs!
s08_e20_c09_u275	You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!
s08_e20_c09_u276	Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
s08_e20_c09_u277	You should be!
s08_e20_c09_u278	Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
s08_e20_c09_u279	You got it!
s08_e20_c09_u280	Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs. Green.) Mrs. Green! Okay I'm really sorry!! I'm apologizing for the-(She trips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!
s08_e20_c10_u281	(closing a book) Okay! I'm ready.
s08_e20_c10_u282	You sure?
s08_e20_c10_u283	Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
s08_e20_c10_u284	All right then. (Gets up, in an announcer's voice) Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
s08_e20_c10_u285	Uh, put your elbow in it.
s08_e20_c10_u286	Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
s08_e20_c10_u287	Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
s08_e20_c10_u288	That's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)
s08_e20_c10_u289	Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!
s08_e20_c10_u290	Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
s08_e20_c10_u291	A card! A card! I pick a card!
s08_e20_c10_u292	Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I've lost sight of why we're doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)
s07_e21_c01_u001	Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
s07_e21_c01_u002	Do you realize you get louder each week?
s07_e21_c01_u003	There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
s07_e21_c01_u004	I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow. (Laughs)
s07_e21_c01_u005	Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
s07_e21_c01_u006	Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
s07_e21_c01_u007	No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
s07_e21_c01_u008	Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
s07_e21_c01_u009	(handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart. (She goes back, sits down, and starts feverishly writing.)
s07_e21_c01_u010	(watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
s07_e21_c02_u011	(writing) Monica, there are no words- (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!
s07_e21_c02_u012	All right, uh- (To Ross) Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
s07_e21_c02_u013	Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
s07_e21_c02_u014	I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
s07_e21_c03_u015	Monica what?
s07_e21_c03_u016	What?!
s07_e21_c03_u017	What is the emergency?!
s07_e21_c03_u018	You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this! (Shows them what she's been working on.)
s07_e21_c03_u019	Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
s07_e21_c03_u020	Thank you.
s07_e21_c03_u021	Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)
s07_e21_c03_u022	Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)
s07_e21_c03_u023	Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
s07_e21_c03_u024	Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
s07_e21_c03_u025	Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
s07_e21_c03_u026	...everyone, this is Chandler!
s07_e21_c03_u027	Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
s07_e21_c03_u028	(seeing her) Okay.
s07_e21_c03_u029	Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
s07_e21_c03_u030	All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
s07_e21_c03_u031	Ennnh.
s07_e21_c03_u032	Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
s07_e21_c03_u033	Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like- (They all try to think about one example and don't succeed.) Or all the things you taught him.
s07_e21_c03_u034	Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there's more than three), five, six, and seven!
s07_e21_c03_u035	(shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That's one?
s07_e21_c03_u036	It's kind of an important one!
s07_e21_c03_u037	Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
s07_e21_c03_u038	Well, y'know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could've meant.)
s07_e21_c03_u039	All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 -7..-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)
s07_e21_c03_u040	Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica
s07_e21_c03_u041	(writing) Monica
s07_e21_c03_u042	"-when I look back over our time together-"
s07_e21_c03_u043	(writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
s07_e21_c03_u044	Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
s07_e21_c03_u045	Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
s07_e21_c03_u046	No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
s07_e21_c03_u047	You'll get one.
s07_e21_c03_u048	Oh yeah? When?
s07_e21_c03_u049	All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
s07_e21_c03_u050	Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
s07_e21_c03_u051	Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
s07_e21_c03_u052	Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
s07_e21_c03_u053	No, no, no.
s07_e21_c03_u054	What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
s07_e21_c03_u055	(trapped) Uh, uh.
s07_e21_c03_u056	Well?
s07_e21_c03_u057	Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
s07_e21_c03_u058	Nice try.
s07_e21_c03_u059	Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
s07_e21_c03_u060	Look, Monica
s07_e21_c03_u061	Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
s07_e21_c03_u062	This is not going to work.
s07_e21_c03_u063	I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
s07_e21_c03_u064	You are so great! I love you!
s07_e21_c03_u065	What?
s07_e21_c03_u066	Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
s07_e21_c03_u067	You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
s07_e21_c03_u068	No I didn't!
s07_e21_c03_u069	Yes, you did!
s07_e21_c03_u070	No I didn't!
s07_e21_c03_u071	You love me!
s07_e21_c03_u072	No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
s07_e21_c03_u073	Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
s07_e21_c03_u074	Then all your stuff would be here.
s07_e21_c03_u075	Well, what if all my stuff was here?
s07_e21_c03_u076	Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
s07_e21_c03_u077	Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
s07_e21_c03_u078	You wanted it to be a surprise.
s07_e21_c03_u079	Oh my God.
s07_e21_c03_u080	Chandler- In all my life- I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As to-fall in love with my best-my best- There's a reason why girls don't do this!
s07_e21_c03_u081	Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought- (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?
s07_e21_c03_u082	Yes.
s07_e21_c03_u083	(yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
s07_e21_c03_u084	Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We're engaged!!!
s07_e21_c04_u085	Hey!
s07_e21_c04_u086	Hey!
s07_e21_c04_u087	Hey!
s07_e21_c04_u088	Hey!
s07_e21_c04_u089	Hey, what have you guys been up to?
s07_e21_c04_u090	Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
s07_e21_c04_u091	How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
s07_e21_c04_u092	How's Monica coming along with her vows?
s07_e21_c04_u093	Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, cause she's not so good at the writing.
s07_e21_c04_u094	I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
s07_e21_c04_u095	Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
s07_e21_c04_u096	Phoebe that's not true.
s07_e21_c04_u097	Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
s07_e21_c04_u098	I can't believe they've been together for three years.
s07_e21_c04_u099	(shocked) Has it been that long?!
s07_e21_c04_u100	Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
s07_e21_c04_u101	Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
s07_e21_c04_u102	I've had a very long, hard day.
s07_e21_c04_u103	Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
s07_e21_c04_u104	Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
s07_e21_c04_u105	Okay.
s07_e21_c04_u106	Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
s07_e21_c04_u107	Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
s07_e21_c04_u108	Hey Joe!
s07_e21_c04_u109	Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke.
s07_e21_c04_u110	I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
s07_e21_c04_u111	I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
s07_e21_c04_u112	(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
s07_e21_c04_u113	Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
s07_e21_c04_u114	How?! When?!
s07_e21_c04_u115	It happened in London.
s07_e21_c04_u116	IN LONDON!!!
s07_e21_c04_u117	The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
s07_e21_c04_u118	But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
s07_e21_c04_u119	No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
s07_e21_c04_u120	Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
s07_e21_c04_u121	All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
s07_e21_c04_u122	(on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
s07_e21_c04_u123	(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
s07_e21_c04_u124	(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
s07_e21_c04_u125	Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
s07_e21_c04_u126	(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
s07_e21_c04_u127	What?!
s07_e21_c04_u128	(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
s07_e21_c04_u129	Oh my God!
s07_e21_c04_u130	CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
s07_e21_c04_u131	OH MY GOD!!!
s07_e21_c04_u132	OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
s07_e21_c04_u133	Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
s07_e21_c04_u134	NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
s07_e21_c04_u135	I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
s07_e21_c04_u136	YOU KNOW?!!!
s07_e21_c04_u137	Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
s07_e21_c04_u138	(entering) What's going on?
s07_e21_c04_u139	(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!
s07_e21_c04_u140	What?! What?!
s07_e21_c04_u141	Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
s07_e21_c04_u142	Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
s07_e21_c04_u143	(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)
s07_e21_c04_u144	Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
s07_e21_c04_u145	Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
s07_e21_c04_u146	Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
s07_e21_c04_u147	All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
s07_e21_c04_u148	Bye!
s07_e21_c04_u149	Bye!
s07_e21_c04_u150	Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
s07_e21_c04_u151	(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
s07_e21_c04_u152	Actually, I did!
s07_e21_c04_u153	Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
s07_e21_c04_u154	Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
s07_e21_c04_u155	Phoebe knows about us!
s07_e21_c04_u156	Well I didn't tell them!
s07_e21_c04_u157	Them?! Who's them?
s07_e21_c04_u158	Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
s07_e21_c04_u159	Joey!
s07_e21_c04_u160	And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
s07_e21_c04_u161	Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So
s07_e21_c04_u162	Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
s07_e21_c04_u163	I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
s07_e21_c04_u164	Are you kidding?!
s07_e21_c04_u165	No!
s07_e21_c04_u166	I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?
s07_e21_c04_u167	No.
s07_e21_c04_u168	Joey!
s07_e21_c04_u169	They know you know.
s07_e21_c04_u170	Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
s07_e21_c04_u171	God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!
s07_e21_c04_u172	I couldn't even if I wanted too.
s07_e21_c04_u173	Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
s07_e21_c04_u174	She's bluffing!
s07_e21_c04_u175	Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
s07_e21_c04_u176	He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
s07_e21_c04_u177	(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
s07_e21_c04_u178	Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
s07_e21_c04_u179	Ooh!
s07_e21_c04_u180	Okay!
s07_e21_c04_u181	I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
s07_e21_c04_u182	Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
s07_e21_c04_u183	It's not my first time.
s07_e21_c04_u184	You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
s07_e21_c04_u185	Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
s07_e21_c04_u186	Of course.
s07_e21_c04_u187	Oh, you're-you're going?
s07_e21_c04_u188	Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
s07_e21_c04_u189	(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
s07_e21_c04_u190	You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
s07_e21_c04_u191	Not if I kiss you first.
s07_e21_c04_u192	Ooh.
s07_e21_c04_u193	Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
s07_e21_c04_u194	Here it comes. Our first kiss.
s07_e21_c04_u195	Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
s07_e21_c04_u196	And why not?!
s07_e21_c04_u197	Because I'm in love with Monica!!
s07_e21_c04_u198	You're-you're what?!
s07_e21_c04_u199	Love her! That's right, I-LOVE-HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
s07_e21_c04_u200	I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
s07_e21_c04_u201	I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
s07_e21_c04_u202	So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
s07_e21_c04_u203	Well actually, Ross doesn't.
s07_e21_c04_u204	Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
s07_e21_c04_u205	(He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh- What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
s07_e21_c05_u206	Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
s07_e21_c05_u207	You really think it would be that different?
s07_e21_c05_u208	How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
s07_e21_c05_u209	Well, things change.
s07_e21_c05_u210	I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
s07_e21_c05_u211	It'll be okay Joe.
s07_e21_c05_u212	I'm sorry, I just-I like things the way they are.
s07_e21_c05_u213	Hey, who's this little naked guy?
s07_e21_c05_u214	That little naked guy would be me.
s07_e21_c05_u215	Aww, look at the little thing.
s07_e21_c05_u216	Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
s07_e21_c05_u217	Who are those people?
s07_e21_c05_u218	Got me.
s07_e21_c05_u219	Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
s07_e21_c05_u220	Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
s07_e21_c05_u221	Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
s07_e21_c05_u222	Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
s07_e21_c05_u223	Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
s07_e21_c05_u224	(looking) Nono, that would be me again.
s07_e21_c05_u225	Hey, you guys!
s07_e21_c05_u226	Hey.
s07_e21_c05_u227	Hey.
s07_e21_c05_u228	What's going on?
s07_e21_c05_u229	Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
s07_e21_c05_u230	Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
s07_e21_c05_u231	Oh that's so sweet.
s07_e21_c05_u232	So we both finished our vows.
s07_e21_c05_u233	Oh!
s07_e21_c05_u234	Hey!
s07_e21_c05_u235	Oh, can we read them?
s07_e21_c05_u236	Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
s07_e21_c05_u237	Okay.
s07_e21_c05_u238	Okay.
s07_e21_c05_u239	(To Monica) Oh, that's beautiful.
s07_e21_c05_u240	(To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! That's good!
s07_e21_c05_u241	(To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?
s07_e21_c05_u242	What? I don't get it.
s07_e21_c05_u243	(To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious.
s07_e21_c05_u244	Chandler!!
s07_e21_c05_u245	Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
s07_e21_c06_u246	Okay, what do you guys think?
s07_e21_c06_u247	(quietly) Dude!
s07_e21_c06_u248	(starting to cry) I have never known love like this.
s07_e21_c06_u249	You really like it?
s07_e21_c06_u250	Dude! How-how did you write this?
s07_e21_c06_u251	I stole Monica's and changed the name.
s07_e21_c06_u252	You can't do that!
s07_e21_c06_u253	If he goes first he can!
s09_e17_c01_u001	Hey! Ready to go?
s09_e17_c01_u002	Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
s09_e17_c01_u003	Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!
s09_e17_c01_u004	What are you doin'?
s09_e17_c01_u005	Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
s09_e17_c01_u006	Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
s09_e17_c01_u007	It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
s09_e17_c01_u008	The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
s09_e17_c01_u009	Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
s09_e17_c01_u010	Bet she'd sleep with you now...
s09_e17_c01_u011	No... I already e-mailed her.
s09_e17_c01_u012	Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
s09_e17_c01_u013	You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
s09_e17_c01_u014	Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
s09_e17_c01_u015	(he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
s09_e17_c01_u016	Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
s09_e17_c01_u017	(he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
s09_e17_c01_u018	(he comes back) Alright, let's go!
s09_e17_c01_u019	Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)
s09_e17_c01_u020	I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
s09_e17_c01_u021	(after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)
s09_e17_c02_u022	Hey! How was basketball?
s09_e17_c02_u023	Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
s09_e17_c02_u024	Oh, no! Who did that?
s09_e17_c02_u025	Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)
s09_e17_c02_u026	She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
s09_e17_c02_u027	(still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
s09_e17_c02_u028	Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
s09_e17_c02_u029	Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
s09_e17_c02_u030	All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
s09_e17_c02_u031	Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
s09_e17_c03_u032	Hi.
s09_e17_c03_u033	Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
s09_e17_c03_u034	Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
s09_e17_c03_u035	Oh, I'm so sorry!
s09_e17_c03_u036	Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
s09_e17_c03_u037	You're not gonna need my help?
s09_e17_c03_u038	Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
s09_e17_c03_u039	Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)
s09_e17_c03_u040	Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
s09_e17_c03_u041	Ok, you got it!
s09_e17_c03_u042	(after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
s09_e17_c03_u043	Really? If that's what you want...
s09_e17_c03_u044	That was a test and you just failed.
s09_e17_c03_u045	Damn it! Rookie mistake!
s09_e17_c03_u046	(yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??
s09_e17_c03_u047	I believe I read that somewhere!
s09_e17_c03_u048	That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... (pause) It's not funny!!
s09_e17_c03_u049	I respectfully disagree.
s09_e17_c03_u050	I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
s09_e17_c03_u051	Who cares? Nobody reads those things
s09_e17_c03_u052	You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
s09_e17_c03_u053	I don't have a page.
s09_e17_c03_u054	Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
s09_e17_c04_u055	Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)
s09_e17_c04_u056	(threatening Joey with a scrunchy): Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
s09_e17_c04_u057	It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
s09_e17_c04_u058	What are you doing?
s09_e17_c04_u059	Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
s09_e17_c04_u060	Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
s09_e17_c04_u061	(placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie... (to Emma) This isn't over.
s09_e17_c05_u062	Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) "gay as the day is long"?
s09_e17_c05_u063	Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
s09_e17_c05_u064	But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)
s09_e17_c05_u065	Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
s09_e17_c05_u066	(On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
s09_e17_c05_u067	Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).
s09_e17_c05_u068	What are you doing?
s09_e17_c05_u069	Oh, you'll see my friend.
s09_e17_c05_u070	(visibly upset) I'm dead?
s09_e17_c05_u071	(faking sympathy) And so young.
s09_e17_c05_u072	Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
s09_e17_c05_u073	Well, how you died was funny.
s09_e17_c05_u074	Oh please, hit by a blimp?
s09_e17_c05_u075	It kills over one americans every year.
s09_e17_c05_u076	Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
s09_e17_c05_u077	You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
s09_e17_c05_u078	You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
s09_e17_c06_u079	God, I wish Mike were here.
s09_e17_c06_u080	Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
s09_e17_c06_u081	What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
s09_e17_c06_u082	I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
s09_e17_c06_u083	Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.
s09_e17_c06_u084	Here.
s09_e17_c06_u085	And now your cell.
s09_e17_c06_u086	Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)
s09_e17_c06_u087	This is your cellphone?
s09_e17_c06_u088	Yes.
s09_e17_c06_u089	This is your current cellphone?
s09_e17_c06_u090	Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
s09_e17_c06_u091	Phoebe, where's your purse?
s09_e17_c06_u092	No, no! Give it to me!
s09_e17_c06_u093	You can't have it.
s09_e17_c06_u094	Give it to me!
s09_e17_c06_u095	No (tucks it in her pants)
s09_e17_c06_u096	I'll go in there.
s09_e17_c06_u097	(disbelievingly) Oh yeah.
s09_e17_c06_u098	Phoebe come here
s09_e17_c06_u099	Haha!
s09_e17_c06_u100	Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
s09_e17_c07_u101	Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
s09_e17_c07_u102	Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
s09_e17_c07_u103	No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
s09_e17_c07_u104	Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
s09_e17_c07_u105	No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
s09_e17_c07_u106	Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
s09_e17_c07_u107	Make the transfer! (She does so)
s09_e17_c07_u108	Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
s09_e17_c07_u109	Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
s09_e17_c07_u110	Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
s09_e17_c07_u111	But he's the same.
s09_e17_c07_u112	Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
s09_e17_c07_u113	But he's the same.
s09_e17_c07_u114	Joey, come on!
s09_e17_c07_u115	He's the same!
s09_e17_c07_u116	(to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!
s09_e17_c08_u117	Haha!
s09_e17_c08_u118	You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
s09_e17_c08_u119	So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
s09_e17_c08_u120	Those are my shoes.
s09_e17_c08_u121	Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
s09_e17_c08_u122	Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
s09_e17_c08_u123	Who's that? (goes to open door)
s09_e17_c08_u124	I ordered Chinese food.
s09_e17_c08_u125	What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
s09_e17_c08_u126	(To Mike) What are you doing here?
s09_e17_c08_u127	Phoebe called me.
s09_e17_c08_u128	Phoebe!
s09_e17_c08_u129	I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
s09_e17_c08_u130	Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
s09_e17_c08_u131	There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
s09_e17_c08_u132	Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
s09_e17_c08_u133	Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
s09_e17_c08_u134	(to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!
s09_e17_c08_u135	Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
s09_e17_c08_u136	Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
s09_e17_c08_u137	Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
s09_e17_c08_u138	Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).
s09_e17_c08_u139	Sit down.
s09_e17_c08_u140	Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
s09_e17_c08_u141	(to Phoebe) So how've you been?
s09_e17_c08_u142	I've been pretty good!
s09_e17_c08_u143	(to Phoebe) You look really beautiful.
s09_e17_c08_u144	Thanks, you look good too.
s09_e17_c08_u145	Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
s09_e17_c08_u146	So how's the piano playing going?
s09_e17_c08_u147	Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
s09_e17_c08_u148	I've missed you too.
s09_e17_c08_u149	You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
s09_e17_c09_u150	Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
s09_e17_c09_u151	uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)
s09_e17_c09_u152	Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
s09_e17_c09_u153	Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
s09_e17_c09_u154	No, come on, you know that's not true.
s09_e17_c09_u155	What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
s09_e17_c09_u156	Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
s09_e17_c09_u157	I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
s09_e17_c09_u158	Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
s09_e17_c09_u159	You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
s09_e17_c09_u160	Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
s09_e17_c09_u161	Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
s09_e17_c09_u162	Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
s09_e17_c09_u163	No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
s09_e17_c09_u164	Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
s09_e17_c09_u165	oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
s09_e17_c10_u166	I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
s09_e17_c10_u167	Original or crappy?
s09_e17_c10_u168	Original.
s09_e17_c10_u169	No, sorry haven't seen him.
s09_e17_c10_u170	Then what's that big lump under your covers?
s09_e17_c10_u171	It's Monica, ok?
s09_e17_c10_u172	That's not Monica!
s09_e17_c10_u173	Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
s09_e17_c10_u174	(to herself) Oh God.
s09_e17_c10_u175	... she's being unreasonable!
s09_e17_c10_u176	(yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
s09_e17_c10_u177	It does?
s09_e17_c10_u178	Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
s09_e17_c10_u179	Really? She... she loves me?
s09_e17_c10_u180	Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).
s09_e17_c10_u181	Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
s09_e17_c10_u182	Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!
s09_e17_c10_u183	Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
s09_e17_c10_u184	Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
s09_e17_c10_u185	How do you think I got him in the first place?
s09_e17_c11_u186	Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
s09_e17_c11_u187	I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
s09_e17_c11_u188	I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
s09_e17_c11_u189	It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.
s09_e17_c11_u190	(running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!
s09_e17_c11_u191	What?
s09_e17_c11_u192	Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
s09_e17_c11_u193	Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)
s09_e17_c11_u194	(he bounds into the house) I knew you'd be here!
s09_e17_c11_u195	Oh, crap!
s09_e17_c11_u196	Who is this?
s09_e17_c11_u197	My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
s09_e17_c11_u198	Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
s09_e17_c11_u199	Well, you are not doing a very good job!
s09_e17_c11_u200	Excuse me?
s09_e17_c11_u201	What's with the kissing?
s09_e17_c11_u202	Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
s09_e17_c11_u203	Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
s09_e17_c11_u204	You didn't hear the speech!
s09_e17_c11_u205	I've heard the speech: (in a mocking voice) "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... "
s09_e17_c11_u206	Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
s09_e17_c11_u207	You're weak!
s09_e17_c11_u208	You're... weird!
s09_e17_c11_u209	Your pants are undone!
s09_e17_c11_u210	Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
s09_e17_c11_u211	(looking at the sofa) Where did they go?
s09_e17_c11_u212	Damn it!
s09_e17_c11_u213	Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
s09_e17_c11_u214	And I blame you too.
s09_e17_c12_u215	It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
s09_e17_c12_u216	There you go! Someone came!
s09_e17_c12_u217	Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)
s09_e17_c12_u218	Hi, glad you could come.
s09_e17_c12_u219	(in a mournful voice) Please, come in.
s09_e17_c12_u220	Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
s09_e17_c12_u221	Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
s09_e17_c12_u222	Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
s09_e17_c12_u223	At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
s09_e17_c12_u224	Who is he?
s09_e17_c12_u225	Some guy, Tom Gordon.
s09_e17_c12_u226	I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)
s09_e17_c12_u227	So, did you know Ross well?
s09_e17_c12_u228	Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
s09_e17_c12_u229	(a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.
s09_e17_c12_u230	What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
s09_e17_c12_u231	(entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)
s09_e17_c12_u232	(before leaving) Hey, listen. Call me.
s09_e17_c12_u233	Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)
s09_e17_c12_u234	(coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?
s09_e17_c12_u235	I look like a man??
s09_e17_c12_u236	Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
s09_e17_c12_u237	It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
s09_e17_c12_u238	You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
s09_e17_c12_u239	Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
s09_e17_c12_u240	Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
s09_e17_c12_u241	(sceptical) Yeah...
s09_e17_c12_u242	I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)
s09_e17_c12_u243	Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
s09_e17_c12_u244	Kori? Kori Weston?
s09_e17_c12_u245	Yeah...
s09_e17_c12_u246	Wow! You look amazing!
s09_e17_c12_u247	And you are...
s09_e17_c12_u248	Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
s09_e17_c12_u249	You are married though.
s09_e17_c12_u250	Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)
s09_e17_c12_u251	I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
s09_e17_c12_u252	I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
s09_e17_c12_u253	We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
s09_e17_c12_u254	I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
s09_e17_c12_u255	I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
s09_e17_c12_u256	(he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
s09_e17_c12_u257	You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)
s09_e17_c12_u258	Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
s09_e17_c13_u259	(on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?
s01_e06_c01_u001	(reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
s01_e06_c01_u002	You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
s01_e06_c01_u003	The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
s01_e06_c01_u004	Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
s01_e06_c01_u005	Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)
s01_e06_c02_u006	God. I feel violated.
s01_e06_c02_u007	Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
s01_e06_c02_u008	(staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.
s01_e06_c02_u009	Is it? Feels like two.
s01_e06_c02_u010	No, ten o'clock.
s01_e06_c02_u011	What?
s01_e06_c02_u012	(sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
s01_e06_c02_u013	Oh. Hel-lo!
s01_e06_c02_u014	She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
s01_e06_c02_u015	Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
s01_e06_c02_u016	Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
s01_e06_c02_u017	Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
s01_e06_c02_u018	Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
s01_e06_c02_u019	He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
s01_e06_c02_u020	Thank you, buddy.
s01_e06_c02_u021	Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
s01_e06_c02_u022	You could do that!
s01_e06_c02_u023	Y'think?
s01_e06_c02_u024	Yeah!
s01_e06_c02_u025	Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
s01_e06_c02_u026	C'mon! C'mon!
s01_e06_c02_u027	Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
s01_e06_c02_u028	...Yes?
s01_e06_c02_u029	Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
s01_e06_c02_u030	Yes, you said that.
s01_e06_c02_u031	Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
s01_e06_c02_u032	Chandler?
s01_e06_c02_u033	Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
s01_e06_c02_u034	Whadja think?
s01_e06_c02_u035	...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
s01_e06_c02_u036	C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
s01_e06_c02_u037	(admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.
s01_e06_c02_u038	(running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
s01_e06_c02_u039	What is it?
s01_e06_c02_u040	The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
s01_e06_c02_u041	Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
s01_e06_c03_u042	Hey, kids.
s01_e06_c03_u043	Hey.
s01_e06_c03_u044	(reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
s01_e06_c03_u045	Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
s01_e06_c03_u046	Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
s01_e06_c03_u047	It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
s01_e06_c03_u048	Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
s01_e06_c03_u049	We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
s01_e06_c03_u050	Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
s01_e06_c03_u051	'We' would be me and Rick.
s01_e06_c03_u052	Who's Rick?
s01_e06_c03_u053	My husband.
s01_e06_c03_u054	Ooooohhh.
s01_e06_c03_u055	No.
s01_e06_c03_u056	Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
s01_e06_c03_u057	No, I'm still married.
s01_e06_c03_u058	So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
s01_e06_c03_u059	Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
s01_e06_c03_u060	Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
s01_e06_c03_u061	Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
s01_e06_c03_u062	What?!
s01_e06_c03_u063	I suppose mainly sexual.
s01_e06_c03_u064	...Hm.
s01_e06_c03_u065	Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
s01_e06_c03_u066	What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
s01_e06_c03_u067	Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
s01_e06_c03_u068	Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
s01_e06_c03_u069	Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
s01_e06_c03_u070	No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
s01_e06_c03_u071	What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
s01_e06_c03_u072	I couldn't do it.
s01_e06_c03_u073	Good for you, Joey.
s01_e06_c03_u074	When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
s01_e06_c03_u075	Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
s01_e06_c03_u076	Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
s01_e06_c03_u077	We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
s01_e06_c03_u078	Yeah! C'mon!
s01_e06_c03_u079	Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
s01_e06_c04_u080	Tah-daaah!
s01_e06_c04_u081	Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
s01_e06_c04_u082	Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
s01_e06_c04_u083	Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
s01_e06_c04_u084	Well, whaddya think?
s01_e06_c04_u085	Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
s01_e06_c04_u086	...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
s01_e06_c04_u087	Uh-oh...
s01_e06_c04_u088	How-how did that happen?
s01_e06_c04_u089	I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
s01_e06_c04_u090	Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
s01_e06_c04_u091	(to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
s01_e06_c04_u092	Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
s01_e06_c04_u093	You guys, I am not that bad!
s01_e06_c04_u094	Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
s01_e06_c04_u095	That is so unfair!
s01_e06_c04_u096	Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
s01_e06_c04_u097	Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
s01_e06_c04_u098	Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
s01_e06_c04_u099	Why not?
s01_e06_c04_u100	Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
s01_e06_c04_u101	I could do that.
s01_e06_c04_u102	Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
s01_e06_c04_u103	Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
s01_e06_c04_u104	Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
s01_e06_c04_u105	STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
s01_e06_c04_u106	Monica? You're Mom.
s01_e06_c04_u107	Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
s01_e06_c04_u108	(on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
s01_e06_c04_u109	Oh my God! Whoah!
s01_e06_c04_u110	Well, what's the part?
s01_e06_c04_u111	Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
s01_e06_c04_u112	Seriously, what-what's the part?
s01_e06_c04_u113	"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
s01_e06_c04_u114	C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
s01_e06_c04_u115	...I'm his (mumbles)
s01_e06_c04_u116	..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
s01_e06_c04_u117	...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
s01_e06_c04_u118	(trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
s01_e06_c04_u119	C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
s01_e06_c04_u120	Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
s01_e06_c04_u121	Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
s01_e06_c04_u122	You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
s01_e06_c05_u123	Alright, alright, alright...
s01_e06_c05_u124	Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
s01_e06_c05_u125	For what?
s01_e06_c05_u126	Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
s01_e06_c05_u127	Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
s01_e06_c05_u128	Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
s01_e06_c05_u129	Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
s01_e06_c05_u130	He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
s01_e06_c05_u131	C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
s01_e06_c05_u132	I warned you...
s01_e06_c05_u133	Who is being loud?
s01_e06_c05_u134	Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
s01_e06_c05_u135	Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
s01_e06_c05_u136	Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)
s01_e06_c05_u137	Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
s01_e06_c05_u138	No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)
s01_e06_c05_u139	Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
s01_e06_c06_u140	Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
s01_e06_c06_u141	Lose the robe.
s01_e06_c06_u142	Me?
s01_e06_c06_u143	That would work.
s01_e06_c06_u144	Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is lost.
s01_e06_c06_u145	Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action.
s01_e06_c06_u146	And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
s01_e06_c06_u147	Well, I'm- I'm showering.
s01_e06_c06_u148	No, that was clenching.
s01_e06_c06_u149	Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
s01_e06_c06_u150	I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?
s01_e06_c06_u151	I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
s01_e06_c07_u152	God, I love these fingers...
s01_e06_c07_u153	Thank you.
s01_e06_c07_u154	No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
s01_e06_c07_u155	(moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She starts to get up.)
s01_e06_c07_u156	Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)
s01_e06_c07_u157	Okay.
s01_e06_c07_u158	Don't go.
s01_e06_c07_u159	Okay. Oh no, I have to.
s01_e06_c07_u160	(to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.
s01_e06_c07_u161	(getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
s01_e06_c07_u162	Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
s01_e06_c07_u163	It's not Rick.
s01_e06_c07_u164	What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
s01_e06_c07_u165	No, it's-it's Andrew.
s01_e06_c07_u166	I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
s01_e06_c07_u167	He's... new.
s01_e06_c07_u168	Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
s01_e06_c07_u169	No, that's not exactly what I was..
s01_e06_c07_u170	Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
s01_e06_c07_u171	So what do you want?
s01_e06_c07_u172	You.
s01_e06_c07_u173	You have me!
s01_e06_c07_u174	Nono, just you.
s01_e06_c07_u175	Whaddyou mean?
s01_e06_c07_u176	Lose the other guys.
s01_e06_c07_u177	...Like, ...all of them?
s01_e06_c07_u178	C'mon, we're great together, why not?
s01_e06_c07_u179	Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
s01_e06_c07_u180	...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
s01_e06_c07_u181	So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
s01_e06_c07_u182	I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
s01_e06_c07_u183	Which one?
s01_e06_c07_u184	...The second guy.
s01_e06_c07_u185	(gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.
s01_e06_c07_u186	Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
s01_e06_c08_u187	Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
s01_e06_c08_u188	Hey!
s01_e06_c08_u189	Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
s01_e06_c08_u190	Nope.
s01_e06_c08_u191	No? What happened, big guy?
s01_e06_c08_u192	(to Ross) "Big guy?"
s01_e06_c08_u193	It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
s01_e06_c08_u194	I got fired.
s01_e06_c08_u195	Oh!
s01_e06_c08_u196	Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
s01_e06_c08_u197	Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
s01_e06_c08_u198	My mom will.
s01_e06_c08_u199	Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
s01_e06_c08_u200	Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
s01_e06_c08_u201	Maybe this wasn't your shot.
s01_e06_c08_u202	Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
s01_e06_c08_u203	Hard to tell, I was naked.
s01_e06_c08_u204	No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
s01_e06_c08_u205	Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
s01_e06_c08_u206	I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
s01_e06_c08_u207	Night.
s01_e06_c08_u208	Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
s01_e06_c08_u209	(determined) Uh-huh!
s01_e06_c08_u210	Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
s01_e06_c08_u211	Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her room.)
s01_e06_c08_u212	She is a kook.
s01_e06_c09_u213	(hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)
s09_e14_c01_u001	Morning, roomie!
s09_e14_c01_u002	Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
s09_e14_c01_u003	Fifth day's a charm.
s09_e14_c01_u004	Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
s09_e14_c01_u005	Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
s09_e14_c01_u006	Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
s09_e14_c01_u007	Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...
s09_e14_c01_u008	She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
s09_e14_c01_u009	Bye!
s09_e14_c01_u010	Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
s09_e14_c01_u011	No, hey, it's been great.
s09_e14_c01_u012	Yeah?
s09_e14_c01_u013	Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
s09_e14_c01_u014	Yeah, that'll do it.
s09_e14_c01_u015	Wow! So, how are you?
s09_e14_c01_u016	I'm, I'm okay.
s09_e14_c01_u017	Really?
s09_e14_c01_u018	Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
s09_e14_c01_u019	Well, actually it...
s09_e14_c01_u020	No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
s09_e14_c01_u021	Wow, really?
s09_e14_c01_u022	Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
s09_e14_c01_u023	Sure, I know lots of girls.
s09_e14_c01_u024	Yeah? Any names come to mind?
s09_e14_c01_u025	Ooh, names?
s09_e14_c02_u026	Hey.
s09_e14_c02_u027	Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
s09_e14_c02_u028	What you got?
s09_e14_c02_u029	Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.
s09_e14_c02_u030	I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
s09_e14_c02_u031	Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
s09_e14_c02_u032	Why are they doing this?
s09_e14_c02_u033	I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
s09_e14_c02_u034	You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
s09_e14_c02_u035	I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
s09_e14_c02_u036	I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
s09_e14_c02_u037	I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
s09_e14_c02_u038	Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
s09_e14_c02_u039	You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
s09_e14_c02_u040	Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
s09_e14_c02_u041	So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
s09_e14_c02_u042	I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
s09_e14_c02_u043	Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.
s09_e14_c02_u044	Ooh, that's a great plan!
s09_e14_c02_u045	Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh." (A maniacal laugh follows.)
s09_e14_c02_u046	Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
s09_e14_c03_u047	Hey!
s09_e14_c03_u048	Hey!
s09_e14_c03_u049	You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
s09_e14_c03_u050	See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
s09_e14_c03_u051	I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
s09_e14_c03_u052	Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
s09_e14_c03_u053	Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
s09_e14_c03_u054	Oh my god.
s09_e14_c03_u055	Wow.
s09_e14_c03_u056	Why? What's the big deal?
s09_e14_c03_u057	Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
s09_e14_c03_u058	What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
s09_e14_c03_u059	Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
s09_e14_c03_u060	You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
s09_e14_c03_u061	So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
s09_e14_c03_u062	Oh, it's perfect.
s09_e14_c03_u063	Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
s09_e14_c04_u064	Ooh, Joey.
s09_e14_c04_u065	Hey.
s09_e14_c04_u066	Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
s09_e14_c04_u067	All right! Who is he?
s09_e14_c04_u068	Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
s09_e14_c04_u069	Oh, yeah.
s09_e14_c04_u070	She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
s09_e14_c04_u071	A teacher?
s09_e14_c04_u072	Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
s09_e14_c04_u073	Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
s09_e14_c04_u074	Oh my god, you're right!
s09_e14_c04_u075	Yeah.
s09_e14_c04_u076	She even reads for pleasure!
s09_e14_c04_u077	How do you even know a woman like that?
s09_e14_c04_u078	What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
s09_e14_c04_u079	Joey.
s09_e14_c04_u080	I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
s09_e14_c04_u081	So now what do we do?
s09_e14_c04_u082	Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
s09_e14_c04_u083	What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
s09_e14_c04_u084	Ooh...I hear that's bad.
s09_e14_c04_u085	Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
s09_e14_c04_u086	Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)
s09_e14_c04_u087	It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real "plan-laugh.")
s09_e14_c04_u088	Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
s09_e14_c04_u089	No, I think we killed it.
s09_e14_c05_u090	Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
s09_e14_c05_u091	No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
s09_e14_c05_u092	Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
s09_e14_c05_u093	I don't do that.
s09_e14_c05_u094	I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
s09_e14_c05_u095	Yeah.
s09_e14_c05_u096	Today is the sixth.
s09_e14_c05_u097	No, it's not.
s09_e14_c05_u098	Yes, it's also 2003.
s09_e14_c05_u099	Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
s09_e14_c05_u100	It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
s09_e14_c05_u101	Okay.
s09_e14_c05_u102	Tough crib.
s09_e14_c05_u103	Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
s09_e14_c05_u104	I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
s09_e14_c05_u105	Chandler!
s09_e14_c05_u106	I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
s09_e14_c06_u107	Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
s09_e14_c06_u108	Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
s09_e14_c06_u109	Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
s09_e14_c06_u110	Can I get you another glass of wine?
s09_e14_c06_u111	Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
s09_e14_c06_u112	Got stood up, huh?
s09_e14_c06_u113	Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
s09_e14_c06_u114	Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
s09_e14_c06_u115	No!
s09_e14_c07_u116	We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
s09_e14_c07_u117	Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
s09_e14_c07_u118	So, let's do this.
s09_e14_c07_u119	I - I don't think I can.
s09_e14_c07_u120	Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
s09_e14_c07_u121	Because of Emma.
s09_e14_c07_u122	Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
s09_e14_c07_u123	Sorry.
s09_e14_c07_u124	Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
s09_e14_c07_u125	Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
s09_e14_c07_u126	Canoodling?
s09_e14_c07_u127	Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
s09_e14_c07_u128	I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
s09_e14_c07_u129	Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
s09_e14_c07_u130	I guess you're right.
s09_e14_c07_u131	You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
s09_e14_c07_u132	But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
s09_e14_c08_u133	Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
s09_e14_c08_u134	Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
s09_e14_c08_u135	I'm kind of funny looking.
s09_e14_c08_u136	What?
s09_e14_c08_u137	Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
s09_e14_c08_u138	I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't gonna happen.
s09_e14_c08_u139	Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
s09_e14_c08_u140	I lost it. To drugs.
s09_e14_c08_u141	I silk-screen t-shirts now.
s09_e14_c08_u142	Really? What's that like?
s09_e14_c08_u143	It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
s09_e14_c08_u144	I do like my hair.
s09_e14_c08_u145	Really?
s09_e14_c09_u146	Hello?
s09_e14_c09_u147	Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
s09_e14_c09_u148	Hey, Rach!
s09_e14_c09_u149	This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
s09_e14_c09_u150	You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
s09_e14_c09_u151	I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
s09_e14_c09_u152	Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
s09_e14_c09_u153	He's not stoned.
s09_e14_c09_u154	Did he go out for a cigarette?
s09_e14_c09_u155	Yeah, four times.
s09_e14_c09_u156	My dear, sweet Rach.
s09_e14_c09_u157	Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
s09_e14_c09_u158	By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
s09_e14_c10_u159	She's asleep. Chandler?
s09_e14_c10_u160	What are you doing?
s09_e14_c10_u161	Emma was doing it!
s09_e14_c10_u162	She's asleep.
s09_e14_c10_u163	Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
s09_e14_c10_u164	Yes, but we have to be fast.
s09_e14_c10_u165	Hello?
s09_e14_c10_u166	Emma? Hey! Hi!
s09_e14_c10_u167	How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
s09_e14_c10_u168	You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
s09_e14_c11_u169	I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
s09_e14_c11_u170	Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
s09_e14_c11_u171	Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
s09_e14_c11_u172	Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
s09_e14_c11_u173	Ooh...
s09_e14_c11_u174	Just the crab cakes.
s09_e14_c11_u175	What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.
s09_e14_c11_u176	Just get out of here, okay?
s09_e14_c11_u177	What's - what's going on?
s09_e14_c11_u178	Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.
s09_e14_c11_u179	What? You - you're making money off my misery?
s09_e14_c11_u180	Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
s09_e14_c11_u181	This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
s09_e14_c12_u182	Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
s09_e14_c12_u183	I think we may have really done it this time.
s09_e14_c12_u184	Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
s09_e14_c12_u185	You may wanna get some more of those too.
s09_e14_c12_u186	Where's Emma?
s09_e14_c12_u187	Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
s09_e14_c12_u188	Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
s09_e14_c12_u189	Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
s09_e14_c12_u190	Okay. (Runs out.)
s09_e14_c12_u191	Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
s09_e14_c13_u192	No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
s09_e14_c13_u193	Really?
s09_e14_c13_u194	Don't touch my coat!
s09_e14_c13_u195	Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
s09_e14_c13_u196	Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
s09_e14_c13_u197	Hey, did you stop by here?
s09_e14_c13_u198	No.
s09_e14_c13_u199	Oh my god, then...
s09_e14_c13_u200	Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
s09_e14_c13_u201	What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
s09_e14_c13_u202	Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.
s09_e14_c13_u203	Because you two were having sex!
s09_e14_c13_u204	No, we weren't!
s09_e14_c13_u205	Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.) You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
s09_e14_c13_u206	All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
s09_e14_c13_u207	Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
s09_e14_c13_u208	No, no, no.
s09_e14_c13_u209	No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
s09_e14_c13_u210	Hey, I gotta! Unless...
s09_e14_c13_u211	Unless what?
s09_e14_c13_u212	Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
s09_e14_c13_u213	What? Why?
s09_e14_c13_u214	Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
s09_e14_c13_u215	Your family name is Tribbiani.
s09_e14_c13_u216	(BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.
s09_e14_c14_u217	Well, uh...
s09_e14_c14_u218	Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you like to make love to me?
s09_e14_c14_u219	Really, really not.
s09_e14_c14_u220	Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.
s09_e14_c14_u221	All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
s09_e14_c14_u222	Hey, what's wrong?
s09_e14_c14_u223	I just had a rough night.
s09_e14_c14_u224	Oh. Crab cake?
s09_e14_c14_u225	Eww!
s09_e14_c14_u226	Well, what happened?
s09_e14_c14_u227	Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
s09_e14_c14_u228	Monica told me you had a blind date.
s09_e14_c14_u229	Yeah.
s09_e14_c14_u230	I did, too.
s09_e14_c14_u231	Oh.
s09_e14_c14_u232	But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
s09_e14_c14_u233	Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
s09_e14_c14_u234	Why does everyone keep saying that?
s09_e14_c14_u235	Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
s09_e14_c14_u236	That bad?
s09_e14_c14_u237	Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
s09_e14_c14_u238	Female body inspector? What size is that?
s09_e14_c14_u239	Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
s09_e14_c14_u240	Uh-huh.
s09_e14_c14_u241	How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
s09_e14_c14_u242	It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
s09_e14_c14_u243	Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
s09_e14_c14_u244	Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.
s09_e14_c14_u245	Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
s09_e14_c14_u246	The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
s09_e14_c14_u247	Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
s09_e14_c14_u248	We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
s09_e14_c14_u249	Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
s09_e14_c14_u250	Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!
s09_e14_c14_u251	Where?
s09_e14_c14_u252	Mexico!
s09_e14_c15_u253	Can you believe they're still not here?
s09_e14_c15_u254	I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
s09_e14_c15_u255	I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
s09_e14_c15_u256	What?
s09_e14_c15_u257	We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.
s09_e14_c15_u258	Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.
s09_e14_c15_u259	I have such fat hands!
s06_e23_c01_u001	Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
s06_e23_c01_u002	Now, have you told anyone else?
s06_e23_c01_u003	No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
s06_e23_c01_u004	You told me.
s06_e23_c01_u005	Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
s06_e23_c01_u006	Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
s06_e23_c01_u007	Me too.
s06_e23_c01_u008	Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)
s06_e23_c01_u009	Hey.
s06_e23_c01_u010	Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
s06_e23_c01_u011	Oh all right.
s06_e23_c01_u012	Yeah, coffeehouse.
s06_e23_c01_u013	Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
s06_e23_c01_u014	Oh well, we don't because we got-the-other pl-place.
s06_e23_c01_u015	How rude.
s06_e23_c01_u016	Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)
s06_e23_c02_u017	So how are things going with Paul?
s06_e23_c02_u018	Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
s06_e23_c02_u019	That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
s06_e23_c02_u020	So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
s06_e23_c02_u021	No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
s06_e23_c02_u022	(entering) Hi honey.
s06_e23_c02_u023	Hi!
s06_e23_c02_u024	(To Rachel) Watch this.
s06_e23_c02_u025	(To Rachel) How are you?
s06_e23_c02_u026	(To Phoebe) Okay.
s06_e23_c02_u027	Hi Paul!
s06_e23_c02_u028	Hi Phoebe.
s06_e23_c02_u029	So how are things going with you?
s06_e23_c02_u030	Can't complain.
s06_e23_c02_u031	(whispering) Come on.
s06_e23_c02_u032	Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)
s06_e23_c02_u033	(To Ross) Hey!
s06_e23_c02_u034	Hi!
s06_e23_c02_u035	Ross!
s06_e23_c02_u036	Great to see you!
s06_e23_c02_u037	Good to see you too!
s06_e23_c02_u038	How you doing?
s06_e23_c02_u039	Good. Bye! (Starts to leave.)
s06_e23_c02_u040	Okay! You take care!
s06_e23_c02_u041	Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
s06_e23_c02_u042	Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
s06_e23_c02_u043	Phoebe, why'd you do it?
s06_e23_c02_u044	I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's- He's mad at you!
s06_e23_c02_u045	What?! Why?!
s06_e23_c02_u046	Please, I think you know why.
s06_e23_c02_u047	I can't think of anything.
s06_e23_c02_u048	Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
s06_e23_c02_u049	Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
s06_e23_c02_u050	Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
s06_e23_c02_u051	I guess it could.
s06_e23_c02_u052	Well then I think that's it.
s06_e23_c02_u053	Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
s06_e23_c02_u054	Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
s06_e23_c03_u055	Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
s06_e23_c03_u056	Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
s06_e23_c03_u057	It was fine.
s06_e23_c03_u058	Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
s06_e23_c03_u059	I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
s06_e23_c03_u060	Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what-(Puts her hands on his shoulders)-Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
s06_e23_c03_u061	Are you talking about having sex?
s06_e23_c03_u062	No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
s06_e23_c03_u063	Normal.
s06_e23_c03_u064	Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
s06_e23_c03_u065	Nope! That never happened to me!
s06_e23_c03_u066	Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm- The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
s06_e23_c03_u067	Nope.
s06_e23_c03_u068	All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
s06_e23_c03_u069	Okay.
s06_e23_c03_u070	Okay.
s06_e23_c03_u071	Okay.
s06_e23_c03_u072	All right.
s06_e23_c03_u073	When I was six years old.
s06_e23_c03_u074	Hm-mmm.
s06_e23_c03_u075	I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
s06_e23_c03_u076	That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go. (Gets up to leave, but Paul doesn't move.)
s06_e23_c03_u077	It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
s06_e23_c03_u078	Oh!
s06_e23_c03_u079	And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here (points to it) you can see it.
s06_e23_c03_u080	Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
s06_e23_c03_u081	Oh, I couldn't eat now.
s06_e23_c03_u082	What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
s06_e23_c03_u083	Chicken? (Pointing to himself.) Chicken boy!
s06_e23_c03_u084	My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
s06_e23_c04_u085	Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) It's a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)
s06_e23_c04_u086	Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
s06_e23_c04_u087	Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
s06_e23_c04_u088	Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
s06_e23_c04_u089	Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display counter.) Oh, this one's nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
s06_e23_c04_u090	(coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
s06_e23_c04_u091	Can I help you?
s06_e23_c04_u092	Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
s06_e23_c04_u093	Or not, whatever.
s06_e23_c04_u094	This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
s06_e23_c04_u095	Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you-hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
s06_e23_c04_u096	Okay. (Holds out the ring, deadpan.) Will you marry me?
s06_e23_c04_u097	(choking up) Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
s06_e23_c04_u098	Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?
s06_e23_c04_u099	8,600.
s06_e23_c04_u100	We will give you $10.
s06_e23_c04_u101	(angrily) Are you interested in this ring?!
s06_e23_c04_u102	Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
s06_e23_c04_u103	Okay, I can let it go at eight.
s06_e23_c04_u104	We stand firm at $10.
s06_e23_c04_u105	(ignoring her) How would you like to pay?
s06_e23_c04_u106	Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
s06_e23_c04_u107	Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
s06_e23_c04_u108	Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills. (Holds them up from his pocket.)
s06_e23_c04_u109	I'll give you $1 for them.
s06_e23_c05_u110	Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
s06_e23_c05_u111	No.
s06_e23_c05_u112	Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
s06_e23_c05_u113	Yeah.
s06_e23_c05_u114	Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
s06_e23_c05_u115	Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
s06_e23_c05_u116	Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
s06_e23_c05_u117	Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
s06_e23_c05_u118	(handing them the bill) Here you go.
s06_e23_c05_u119	Oh. (Starts to get his money)
s06_e23_c05_u120	Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther Chandler's card.) Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
s06_e23_c05_u121	All the time?
s06_e23_c05_u122	All the time!
s06_e23_c06_u123	Oh my God! Oh my God!!
s06_e23_c06_u124	Still crying?
s06_e23_c06_u125	Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
s06_e23_c06_u126	Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
s06_e23_c06_u127	What's the other one?
s06_e23_c06_u128	I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
s06_e23_c06_u129	Oh that's right. You're the talker. (They both reflect on that briefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
s06_e23_c06_u130	Oh, we have some
s06_e23_c06_u131	No you don't!
s06_e23_c07_u132	Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too much?
s06_e23_c07_u133	A tad.
s06_e23_c07_u134	Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something's missing. It's not- Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
s06_e23_c07_u135	(to the female jeweler) Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
s06_e23_c07_u136	I just sold it to that gentleman. (Points to the one walking out the store.)
s06_e23_c07_u137	Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which locks the store's door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)
s06_e23_c08_u138	Rachel?
s06_e23_c08_u139	No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)
s06_e23_c08_u140	(acting manly to try and cover up his crying) Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
s06_e23_c08_u141	No, did he hug you?!
s06_e23_c08_u142	No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
s06_e23_c08_u143	Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
s06_e23_c08_u144	Hey Chandler?
s06_e23_c08_u145	Yeah?
s06_e23_c08_u146	Would you--.Would you hug me?
s06_e23_c08_u147	I'm a little busy here Paul.
s06_e23_c08_u148	That's exactly what my dad used to say! (Starts to breakdown again.)
s06_e23_c08_u149	Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)
s06_e23_c08_u150	Five more seconds.
s06_e23_c08_u151	Okay! (Pushes him away.)
s06_e23_c08_u152	(entering) Hey!
s06_e23_c08_u153	Joey! (Goes over and hugs Joey and picks him off of his feet.)
s06_e23_c08_u154	Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, "What's going on?") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)
s06_e23_c08_u155	Do you have my credit card?
s06_e23_c08_u156	Yes, it's in my- In-in my pocket. (Paul hasn't dropped him yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!
s06_e23_c08_u157	Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
s06_e23_c08_u158	Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
s06_e23_c08_u159	Oh, I can't go.
s06_e23_c08_u160	Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and- Paul probably
s06_e23_c09_u161	Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)
s06_e23_c09_u162	Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
s06_e23_c09_u163	Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
s06_e23_c09_u164	What?
s06_e23_c09_u165	Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!
s06_e23_c09_u166	They put you in jail?
s06_e23_c09_u167	The little jail between the doors!
s06_e23_c09_u168	Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
s06_e23_c09_u169	I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
s06_e23_c09_u170	Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
s06_e23_c09_u171	Maybe it was the guy.
s06_e23_c09_u172	It was the ring!
s06_e23_c10_u173	Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
s06_e23_c10_u174	No! He blew us off!
s06_e23_c10_u175	What?!
s06_e23_c10_u176	I know!
s06_e23_c10_u177	I can't believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
s06_e23_c10_u178	Can I tell you something? Me too.
s06_e23_c10_u179	Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
s06_e23_c10_u180	Ooooh! Freeze him out.
s06_e23_c10_u181	That's right!
s06_e23_c10_u182	I like it!
s06_e23_c10_u183	Eh? We'll show him!
s06_e23_c10_u184	From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake hands.) Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
s06_e23_c11_u185	Hi. I'm back.
s06_e23_c11_u186	Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
s06_e23_c11_u187	Ah that's great. No actually that's- (In a sexy voice) That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
s06_e23_c11_u188	Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! (Flips a couple pages and points to something.) Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
s06_e23_c11_u189	A lover?
s06_e23_c11_u190	A surfer.
s06_e23_c11_u191	Oh yeah surfer?
s06_e23_c11_u192	I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
s06_e23_c11_u193	Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
s06_e23_c11_u194	(barely glancing at her) No. What ever happened to that little dude. (Pause) So full of dreams
s06_e23_c11_u195	I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
s06_e23_c11_u196	What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
s06_e23_c11_u197	Oh- I'm sorry. I- I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I- This is all just a little overwhelming.
s06_e23_c11_u198	Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you- (Starts to breakdown.) Hard to close em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
s06_e23_c11_u199	I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.) And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm- (Nods in the direction of the bedroom.)
s06_e23_c11_u200	I would really like that. (They kiss.)
s06_e23_c12_u201	That was-so good. (Starts crying again.)
s06_e23_c13_u202	(entering from her room) Hey.
s06_e23_c13_u203	I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
s06_e23_c13_u204	It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
s06_e23_c13_u205	No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
s06_e23_c13_u206	Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
s06_e23_c13_u207	I can't do that.
s06_e23_c13_u208	Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
s06_e23_c14_u209	There he is! (Points.)
s06_e23_c14_u210	Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
s06_e23_c14_u211	Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
s06_e23_c14_u212	Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
s06_e23_c14_u213	Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
s06_e23_c14_u214	Who is it?
s06_e23_c14_u215	It is your office.
s06_e23_c14_u216	Do you know who at my office?
s06_e23_c14_u217	John?
s06_e23_c14_u218	Oh John! Great!
s06_e23_c14_u219	(To Chandler) Here he is.
s06_e23_c14_u220	(to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. (The guy isn't sure.) But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.
s06_e23_c14_u221	Wow! I would trade.
s06_e23_c14_u222	It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
s06_e23_c14_u223	No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
s06_e23_c14_u224	Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
s06_e23_c14_u225	You're dying?!
s06_e23_c14_u226	Yeah, she's dying- Of a cough apparently.
s06_e23_c14_u227	Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity
s06_e23_c14_u228	(interrupting her) Okay, that's enough honey!
s06_e23_c14_u229	I don't know. (Pause) Let me see the ring.
s06_e23_c14_u230	Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)
s06_e23_c14_u231	(looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)
s06_e23_c14_u232	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and he's horrified.) Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
s06_e23_c15_u233	Guys? (They ignore him.) I've got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
s06_e23_c15_u234	(To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.
s06_e23_c15_u235	Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
s06_e23_c15_u236	Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)
s06_e23_c15_u237	Oh my God!!
s06_e23_c15_u238	So you two are really serious?!
s06_e23_c15_u239	Yep, pretty much.
s06_e23_c15_u240	You-you're gonna get married?! I mean- We're gonna be brothers-in-law! (They hug.)
s06_e23_c15_u241	And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
s06_e23_c15_u242	(goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy-What?
s06_e23_c15_u243	Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
s06_e23_c15_u244	Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
s06_e23_c15_u245	I think I'm gonna cry!
s06_e23_c15_u246	(who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
s06_e23_c15_u247	I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
s06_e23_c15_u248	Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so happy!
s06_e23_c15_u249	I know.
s06_e23_c15_u250	(holding an empty tissue box) Where's all the tissues?! (Throws the box down in disgust.)
s06_e23_c16_u251	Check out the ring.
s06_e23_c16_u252	(gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.
s06_e23_c16_u253	(entering) Hi.
s06_e23_c16_u254	Hey-hey Pheebs!
s06_e23_c16_u255	What?
s06_e23_c16_u256	Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
s06_e23_c16_u257	Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
s06_e23_c16_u258	You told her before you told us?
s06_e23_c16_u259	Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)
s04_e01_c01_u001	(surprised) Hi!
s04_e01_c01_u002	Hi!
s04_e01_c01_u003	Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
s04_e01_c01_u004	Awww.
s04_e01_c01_u005	(to Rachel) Thanks a million.
s04_e01_c01_u006	Oh, you're welcome a million.
s04_e01_c01_u007	(getting up and leaving) (to Ross) Okay, I'll see you in our room.
s04_e01_c01_u008	Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)
s04_e01_c01_u009	(softly) Oh my God.
s04_e01_c01_u010	I know.
s04_e01_c01_u011	(stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.
s04_e01_c01_u012	Whoa! What?! Why?!
s04_e01_c01_u013	Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
s04_e01_c01_u014	Here?! Now?!
s04_e01_c01_u015	Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff.
s04_e01_c01_u016	Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
s04_e01_c01_u017	No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
s04_e01_c01_u018	(interrupting) Whoa-ho.
s04_e01_c01_u019	Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?
s04_e01_c01_u020	I don't know.
s04_e01_c01_u021	Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn't every morning.
s04_e01_c01_u022	Oh, making it worse!
s04_e01_c01_u023	Okay.
s04_e01_c02_u024	So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
s04_e01_c02_u025	I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
s04_e01_c02_u026	Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.
s04_e01_c02_u027	How close?
s04_e01_c02_u028	Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.
s04_e01_c02_u029	I don't even know how that would work!
s04_e01_c02_u030	Well, we were...
s04_e01_c02_u031	(interrupting) I'm not asking!
s04_e01_c02_u032	Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
s04_e01_c02_u033	Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
s04_e01_c02_u034	Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
s04_e01_c02_u035	Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
s04_e01_c02_u036	Wait!
s04_e01_c02_u037	I don't ever want to see you again!
s04_e01_c02_u038	(walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where's my purse?
s04_e01_c03_u039	(closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We're out of soda.
s04_e01_c03_u040	(jumping up) Oh, I'll go out and get you some.
s04_e01_c03_u041	Really?!
s04_e01_c03_u042	Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who's entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
s04_e01_c03_u043	Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
s04_e01_c03_u044	I found a dried up seashores.
s04_e01_c03_u045	Sweety, what are you talking about?
s04_e01_c03_u046	Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)
s04_e01_c03_u047	Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
s04_e01_c03_u048	No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
s04_e01_c03_u049	(turning around, insistently) Monica!
s04_e01_c03_u050	Oh.
s04_e01_c04_u051	It's over.
s04_e01_c04_u052	Oh, was it awful?
s04_e01_c04_u053	Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
s04_e01_c04_u054	I wrote you a letter.
s04_e01_c04_u055	Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)
s04_e01_c04_u056	(handing him the letter) It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
s04_e01_c04_u057	Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So, I'd better get cracking on this baby.
s04_e01_c04_u058	Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
s04_e01_c04_u059	Okay, I'll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
s04_e01_c05_u060	Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)
s04_e01_c05_u061	(coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
s04_e01_c05_u062	Done!
s04_e01_c05_u063	You just finished?
s04_e01_c05_u064	Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
s04_e01_c05_u065	So umm, does it?
s04_e01_c05_u066	I'm sorry.
s04_e01_c05_u067	Does it?
s04_e01_c05_u068	Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it?' part just another glance.
s04_e01_c05_u069	What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
s04_e01_c05_u070	(interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does.
s04_e01_c05_u071	Are you sure?
s04_e01_c05_u072	Oh, sure! I'm sure.
s04_e01_c05_u073	I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)
s04_e01_c06_u074	All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
s04_e01_c06_u075	Ennnh.
s04_e01_c06_u076	I've got canned goods.
s04_e01_c06_u077	(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
s04_e01_c06_u078	Excellent hole, Joe.
s04_e01_c06_u079	Oh no! No!! My hole!!
s04_e01_c06_u080	(screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!
s04_e01_c06_u081	(climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!
s04_e01_c06_u082	Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
s04_e01_c06_u083	Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
s04_e01_c06_u084	It's like two miles!
s04_e01_c06_u085	Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
s04_e01_c06_u086	Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
s04_e01_c06_u087	We've got to do something!
s04_e01_c06_u088	Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
s04_e01_c06_u089	What?! What is it?!
s04_e01_c06_u090	You're gonna have to pee on it.
s04_e01_c06_u091	What?!! Gross!!
s04_e01_c06_u092	Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
s04_e01_c06_u093	Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
s04_e01_c06_u094	Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!
s04_e01_c06_u095	If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
s04_e01_c07_u096	Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod Yes.') Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod No.') But for you, yay! Ohh.
s04_e01_c07_u097	Hey!
s04_e01_c07_u098	How was the beach?
s04_e01_c07_u099	Nothing, I don't know.
s04_e01_c07_u100	What happened?
s04_e01_c07_u101	Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
s04_e01_c07_u102	Me too!!
s04_e01_c07_u103	Me too.
s04_e01_c07_u104	Okay, I'm gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.
s04_e01_c07_u105	Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?
s04_e01_c07_u106	It does. It really and truly does.
s04_e01_c07_u107	(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!
s04_e01_c08_u108	She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say Well...) (yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
s04_e01_c08_u109	Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!
s04_e01_c08_u110	Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) If you accept full responsibility... (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! ...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!
s04_e01_c08_u111	No?
s04_e01_c08_u112	Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
s04_e01_c08_u113	(calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
s04_e01_c08_u114	Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler) ever talk about.
s04_e01_c08_u115	What the hell happened on that beach?!
s04_e01_c08_u116	It's between us and the sea, Ross!
s04_e01_c09_u117	(to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.
s04_e01_c09_u118	Hey!
s04_e01_c09_u119	Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
s04_e01_c09_u120	Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
s04_e01_c09_u121	(shocked) You know her?!
s04_e01_c09_u122	No, I umm, I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
s04_e01_c09_u123	There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods Yes.') Well, do you still have it?
s04_e01_c09_u124	(disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door in Phoebe's face.)
s04_e01_c09_u125	I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
s04_e01_c09_u126	Yeah. So how have you been doing?
s04_e01_c09_u127	I, umm, shut up!
s04_e01_c09_u128	(reading from the note) Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this!
s04_e01_c09_u129	Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
s04_e01_c09_u130	Noooo!!
s04_e01_c09_u131	All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartment and slams the door shut.)
s04_e01_c10_u132	Pass the cheese, please.
s04_e01_c10_u133	My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?
s04_e01_c10_u134	Nope.
s04_e01_c10_u135	(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
s04_e01_c10_u136	No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
s04_e01_c10_u137	I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
s04_e01_c10_u138	(coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
s04_e01_c10_u139	NO!!!
s04_e01_c10_u140	All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?
s04_e01_c10_u141	What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
s04_e01_c10_u142	Come on!
s04_e01_c10_u143	What happened? Joey?
s04_e01_c10_u144	All right. (gets up)
s04_e01_c10_u145	(stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!
s04_e01_c10_u146	(running over and joining Monica) They'll never understand!
s04_e01_c10_u147	Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
s04_e01_c10_u148	(interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
s04_e01_c10_u149	(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica's shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
s04_e01_c10_u150	I was in too much pain.
s04_e01_c10_u151	And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
s04_e01_c10_u152	And then Joey remembered something.
s04_e01_c10_u153	I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
s04_e01_c10_u154	Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
s04_e01_c10_u155	Ewwww!!
s04_e01_c10_u156	You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So... (looks at Joey.)
s04_e01_c10_u157	(turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!
s04_e01_c10_u158	That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
s04_e01_c10_u159	(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
s04_e01_c10_u160	(laughs) That's cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
s04_e01_c11_u161	(singing) ...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm. (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you. You go away.
s04_e01_c11_u162	I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
s04_e01_c11_u163	Okay, bye.
s04_e01_c11_u164	No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?
s04_e01_c11_u165	No.
s04_e01_c11_u166	Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done. (starts to leave)
s04_e01_c11_u167	But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?
s04_e01_c11_u168	Yeah, I guess you're right.
s04_e01_c11_u169	It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
s04_e01_c11_u170	Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
s04_e01_c11_u171	I-I like pizza!
s04_e01_c11_u172	You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
s04_e01_c11_u173	Oh my God, so do I!
s04_e01_c11_u174	I knew it, wow!!
s04_e01_c11_u175	Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
s04_e01_c11_u176	Ohh, so cute.
s04_e01_c11_u177	Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you.
s04_e01_c11_u178	I know. I'm mad at me too.
s04_e01_c11_u179	Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
s04_e01_c11_u180	Hey! Me too!
s04_e01_c11_u181	All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
s04_e01_c12_u182	Oh-hooo, I missed you.
s04_e01_c12_u183	I missed you too.
s04_e01_c12_u184	Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?
s04_e01_c12_u185	(getting miffed) I suppose.
s04_e01_c12_u186	You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater.
s04_e01_c12_u187	(getting angry) Umm-hmm.
s04_e01_c12_u188	Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
s04_e01_c12_u189	(yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
s04_e01_c12_u190	(entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
s04_e01_c12_u191	You bet.
s04_e01_c12_u192	And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
s04_e01_c12_u193	Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
s04_e01_c12_u194	I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
s04_e01_c12_u195	What?!!
s04_e01_c12_u196	I fell asleep!
s04_e01_c12_u197	You fell asleep?!
s04_e01_c12_u198	It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means you are,' Y-O-U-R means your!'
s04_e01_c12_u199	Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
s04_e01_c12_u200	(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
s04_e01_c12_u201	Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
s04_e01_c12_u202	Hey!!
s04_e01_c12_u203	(to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
s04_e01_c12_u204	Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
s04_e01_c12_u205	And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
s04_e01_c12_u206	I KNEW IT!!!!
s04_e01_c13_u207	(sets down some cards) Gin.
s04_e01_c13_u208	We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
s04_e01_c13_u209	Will you stop!
s04_e01_c13_u210	Okay. All right.
s04_e01_c13_u211	Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
s03_e15_c01_u001	(to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
s03_e15_c01_u002	I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.
s03_e15_c01_u003	Done.
s03_e15_c01_u004	(entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
s03_e15_c01_u005	Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?
s03_e15_c01_u006	I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is.
s03_e15_c01_u007	Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN.
s03_e15_c01_u008	Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.
s03_e15_c01_u009	Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
s03_e15_c01_u010	Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a g' in there.
s03_e15_c01_u011	Where's that?
s03_e15_c01_u012	In your atlas!
s03_e15_c01_u013	I don't have an atlas.
s03_e15_c01_u014	Oh.
s03_e15_c01_u015	Oh, but wait I do have a globe.
s03_e15_c01_u016	Oh.
s03_e15_c01_u017	Hold on.
s03_e15_c01_u018	So Pheebs what's this guy like?
s03_e15_c01_u019	Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
s03_e15_c01_u020	Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)
s03_e15_c01_u021	What is this?
s03_e15_c01_u022	It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
s03_e15_c01_u023	(entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place.
s03_e15_c01_u024	Oh, no thanks.
s03_e15_c01_u025	Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
s03_e15_c01_u026	Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
s03_e15_c01_u027	Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
s03_e15_c01_u028	Yeah! You wanna come?
s03_e15_c01_u029	Yeah!
s03_e15_c02_u030	Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
s03_e15_c02_u031	(to Chandler and Joey) Can I help you?
s03_e15_c02_u032	Uh-oh.
s03_e15_c02_u033	Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
s03_e15_c02_u034	Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you.
s03_e15_c02_u035	(to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.
s03_e15_c02_u036	Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
s03_e15_c02_u037	Well ah, ........y'know.
s03_e15_c02_u038	Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
s03_e15_c02_u039	Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)
s03_e15_c02_u040	Maybe. Does that scare ya?
s03_e15_c02_u041	Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
s03_e15_c02_u042	We'll be there.
s03_e15_c02_u043	Great. I'll ah, see ya then.
s03_e15_c02_u044	All right, rock on. (Does the Hang 10' sign, then hides his face in shame.)
s03_e15_c03_u045	(something in Russian or Polish)
s03_e15_c03_u046	He's says, Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'
s03_e15_c03_u047	Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.
s03_e15_c03_u048	(leaning in) Your eyes are very pretty.
s03_e15_c03_u049	(to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!
s03_e15_c03_u050	(leaning in) He would like to kiss you.
s03_e15_c03_u051	(to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. (Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! (Mischa tells Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment's over.
s03_e15_c03_u052	Oh.
s03_e15_c03_u053	Oy!
s03_e15_c04_u054	(pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.
s03_e15_c04_u055	Wow! It's small.
s03_e15_c04_u056	Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
s03_e15_c04_u057	So you had fun, huh?
s03_e15_c04_u058	Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way.
s03_e15_c04_u059	No.
s03_e15_c04_u060	(entering) Hey.
s03_e15_c04_u061	Hey.
s03_e15_c04_u062	What is ah, Rach in her room?
s03_e15_c04_u063	Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
s03_e15_c04_u064	Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
s03_e15_c04_u065	All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. (holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.
s03_e15_c04_u066	What's that on the bottom?
s03_e15_c04_u067	Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe) She's fancy.
s03_e15_c04_u068	(answering her phone at work) Hello.
s03_e15_c04_u069	Hey, honey.
s03_e15_c04_u070	Oh, hi.
s03_e15_c04_u071	Hey, what's going on?
s03_e15_c04_u072	Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
s03_e15_c04_u073	What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?
s03_e15_c04_u074	No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with.
s03_e15_c04_u075	(to Monica) Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.
s03_e15_c04_u076	Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
s03_e15_c04_u077	Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
s03_e15_c05_u078	Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
s03_e15_c05_u079	Uh, 10:30.
s03_e15_c05_u080	What time is it now?
s03_e15_c05_u081	4:30.
s03_e15_c05_u082	Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.
s03_e15_c05_u083	Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
s03_e15_c05_u084	Yes. Vividly.
s03_e15_c05_u085	She was kidding about that right?
s03_e15_c05_u086	Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...
s03_e15_c05_u087	God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
s03_e15_c05_u088	Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
s03_e15_c05_u089	Dude, I don't know.
s03_e15_c05_u090	She was kidding.
s03_e15_c05_u091	Yeah.
s03_e15_c05_u092	She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
s03_e15_c05_u093	Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
s03_e15_c05_u094	Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)
s03_e15_c05_u095	Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?
s03_e15_c05_u096	Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
s03_e15_c05_u097	Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
s03_e15_c05_u098	Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
s03_e15_c06_u099	(on the phone) No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We're holding.
s03_e15_c06_u100	(entering, carrying a basket) Hi!
s03_e15_c06_u101	(startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
s03_e15_c06_u102	Well you said you couldn't go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the basket)
s03_e15_c06_u103	You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That's it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
s03_e15_c06_u104	Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.
s03_e15_c06_u105	Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
s03_e15_c06_u106	Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
s03_e15_c06_u107	Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here. (lights a candle)
s03_e15_c06_u108	But I don't, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?! (listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the phone!
s03_e15_c06_u109	I love Mark. (to Ross) Do you know Mark?
s03_e15_c06_u110	Yeah!!
s03_e15_c06_u111	Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)
s03_e15_c06_u112	(stopping grinding) Pepper?
s03_e15_c06_u113	(angrily) None for me.
s03_e15_c06_u114	Okay sorry, whew.
s03_e15_c06_u115	I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... (notices a fire that Ross's candle has started) Oh my God!!
s03_e15_c06_u116	(putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
s03_e15_c06_u117	(on phone) Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?
s03_e15_c06_u118	I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
s03_e15_c06_u119	Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
s03_e15_c06_u120	Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
s03_e15_c06_u121	I don't have ten minutes!!
s03_e15_c06_u122	What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
s03_e15_c06_u123	Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
s03_e15_c06_u124	Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
s03_e15_c06_u125	Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later. (storms out)
s03_e15_c06_u126	Yeah, but wait...
s03_e15_c06_u127	Good bye!
s03_e15_c06_u128	Actually, that's our three hole punch.
s03_e15_c07_u129	Hey.
s03_e15_c07_u130	Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
s03_e15_c07_u131	No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
s03_e15_c07_u132	(throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
s03_e15_c07_u133	For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
s03_e15_c07_u134	You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
s03_e15_c07_u135	Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
s03_e15_c07_u136	But I told you, I didn't have the time!
s03_e15_c07_u137	Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
s03_e15_c07_u138	Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
s03_e15_c07_u139	No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
s03_e15_c07_u140	Just a job!
s03_e15_c07_u141	Yes.
s03_e15_c07_u142	Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
s03_e15_c07_u143	No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
s03_e15_c07_u144	Well neither do I!
s03_e15_c07_u145	Is this about Mark?
s03_e15_c07_u146	(shocked) Oh my God.
s03_e15_c07_u147	Okay, it's not, it's not.
s03_e15_c07_u148	Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
s03_e15_c07_u149	Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
s03_e15_c07_u150	I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
s03_e15_c07_u151	Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, (goes to the door) let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)
s03_e15_c07_u152	No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
s03_e15_c08_u153	And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
s03_e15_c08_u154	(seeing Ross enter) Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. (runs over to Ross) Hi, Ross.
s03_e15_c08_u155	Oh, hi Chloe.
s03_e15_c08_u156	I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and Joey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say let's Ross it!'
s03_e15_c08_u157	And that's the only colour that comes in.
s03_e15_c08_u158	Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
s03_e15_c08_u159	Oh! (storms off)
s03_e15_c08_u160	So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
s03_e15_c08_u161	Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
s03_e15_c09_u162	Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?
s03_e15_c09_u163	Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
s03_e15_c09_u164	Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
s03_e15_c09_u165	(laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
s03_e15_c09_u166	You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
s03_e15_c09_u167	(to Sergei) Boutros Boutros Gali.
s03_e15_c09_u168	He says he was too.
s03_e15_c09_u169	Interesting.
s03_e15_c09_u170	(to Monica) So I was wondering....
s03_e15_c09_u171	Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
s03_e15_c09_u172	(to Phoebe, very quickly) Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. (to Monica) So you're a chef?
s03_e15_c09_u173	I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
s03_e15_c09_u174	Oh, really.
s03_e15_c09_u175	Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What are you doing?
s03_e15_c09_u176	Well, I was having a conversation.
s03_e15_c09_u177	Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
s03_e15_c09_u178	What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
s03_e15_c09_u179	That would be great. Thank you.
s03_e15_c10_u180	(jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!
s03_e15_c10_u181	Oh, hi. It's Mark.
s03_e15_c10_u182	(disappointed) Oh.
s03_e15_c10_u183	What? Is it my breath?
s03_e15_c10_u184	No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!
s03_e15_c10_u185	Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
s03_e15_c10_u186	Yeah. Well, umm.....
s03_e15_c10_u187	Rach, are you okay?
s03_e15_c10_u188	(on the verge of tears) Yeah, I'm fine.
s03_e15_c10_u189	You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
s03_e15_c10_u190	No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
s03_e15_c10_u191	All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
s03_e15_c10_u192	Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
s03_e15_c10_u193	It's for me.
s03_e15_c10_u194	Oh. Okay, bye.
s03_e15_c11_u195	So what are you gonna do?
s03_e15_c11_u196	What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
s03_e15_c11_u197	Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
s03_e15_c11_u198	Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
s03_e15_c11_u199	Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
s03_e15_c11_u200	Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
s03_e15_c11_u201	Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
s03_e15_c11_u202	Why? What happened to him?
s03_e15_c11_u203	Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
s03_e15_c12_u204	Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
s03_e15_c12_u205	Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
s03_e15_c12_u206	No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
s03_e15_c12_u207	Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
s03_e15_c12_u208	Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
s03_e15_c12_u209	Hello.
s03_e15_c12_u210	Hi! It's me.
s03_e15_c12_u211	Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
s03_e15_c12_u212	Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
s03_e15_c12_u213	Hey, what do you want to drink?
s03_e15_c12_u214	Who's that?
s03_e15_c12_u215	Nobody.
s03_e15_c12_u216	Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
s03_e15_c12_u217	Is that Mark?
s03_e15_c12_u218	Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
s03_e15_c12_u219	Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)
s03_e15_c12_u220	Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
s03_e15_c12_u221	Ah, that's okay, thanks.
s03_e15_c12_u222	Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
s03_e15_c12_u223	Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
s03_e15_c12_u224	Oh, okay. (to the bartender) Hey, two beers. (sits down next to him)
s03_e15_c13_u225	(to Monica) And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
s03_e15_c13_u226	Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?
s03_e15_c13_u227	Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
s03_e15_c13_u228	(to Phoebe) Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
s03_e15_c13_u229	Well, tell him, apology accepted.
s03_e15_c13_u230	(to Monica) Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! (to Sergei) You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
s03_e15_c13_u231	Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
s03_e15_c13_u232	Hey, the man's dog just died.
s03_e15_c13_u233	(to Monica) I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
s03_e15_c13_u234	It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons. (they leave)
s03_e15_c13_u235	Uh, (picks up a plate) plate?
s03_e15_c13_u236	Plate! Yes, plate.
s03_e15_c13_u237	Plate. Plate. Plate.
s03_e15_c13_u238	See, we don't need them.
s03_e15_c13_u239	(picking up a cup) Plate?
s03_e15_c13_u240	Yeah.
s03_e15_c14_u241	(to Chloe) I like this song.
s03_e15_c14_u242	Well, you're practically dancing already. Why don't you just do it over here?
s03_e15_c14_u243	Oh, no, no.
s03_e15_c14_u244	What? Are you married? Cause that's okay.
s03_e15_c15_u245	(picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
s03_e15_c16_u246	Still no smile?
s03_e15_c17_u247	(singing) Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. (stops to correct Phoebe) Ameri-ccan.
s03_e15_c17_u248	Ameri-can.
s03_e15_c17_u249	Ameri-ccan.
s03_e15_c17_u250	Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
s03_e15_c17_u251	(to the rest of Central Perk) Everybody!! (In his language, and continues.)
s03_e21_c01_u001	So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
s03_e21_c01_u002	Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
s03_e21_c01_u003	Oh my God, they took my idea!
s03_e21_c01_u004	That was you?!
s03_e21_c01_u005	Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)
s03_e21_c01_u006	(bringing Rachel a mug) Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
s03_e21_c01_u007	Oh my God, are you guys okay?
s03_e21_c01_u008	Are you all right?
s03_e21_c01_u009	(leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is moaning in pain.) Oh my.
s03_e21_c02_u010	(sporting a goatee) Hey.
s03_e21_c02_u011	Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
s03_e21_c02_u012	Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. (there's no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
s03_e21_c02_u013	Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?
s03_e21_c02_u014	(entering) Hey!
s03_e21_c02_u015	Hey.
s03_e21_c02_u016	(triumphantly) I'm gonna be on TV!!
s03_e21_c02_u017	No way!
s03_e21_c02_u018	Yeah! They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it!
s03_e21_c02_u019	Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
s03_e21_c02_u020	Thanks. You ready to go?
s03_e21_c02_u021	Yeah. (they start to leave)
s03_e21_c02_u022	Saw a girl with that vest.
s03_e21_c02_u023	Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
s03_e21_c02_u024	(on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey is intrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a little baby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
s03_e21_c02_u025	(on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
s03_e21_c03_u026	Hi!
s03_e21_c03_u027	Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to skate over to him)
s03_e21_c03_u028	Wow! Skates!
s03_e21_c03_u029	Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
s03_e21_c03_u030	Well... (he holds up a gift he brought her)
s03_e21_c03_u031	Oh, what'd ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
s03_e21_c03_u032	Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
s03_e21_c03_u033	(popping back up) Regular or decaf?
s03_e21_c03_u034	Ah, which ever is closest.
s03_e21_c03_u035	Okay. (hands him a cup)
s03_e21_c03_u036	So ask me what I did today.
s03_e21_c03_u037	So what did you do today Pete?
s03_e21_c03_u038	I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
s03_e21_c03_u039	What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)
s03_e21_c04_u040	Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
s03_e21_c04_u041	What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
s03_e21_c04_u042	I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
s03_e21_c04_u043	And you're still not attracted to him at all?
s03_e21_c04_u044	Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
s03_e21_c04_u045	Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
s03_e21_c04_u046	Oh, please.
s03_e21_c04_u047	What? Honey.
s03_e21_c04_u048	Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
s03_e21_c04_u049	Oh God, I'm so sorry.
s03_e21_c04_u050	I know.
s03_e21_c04_u051	Ow!!
s03_e21_c04_u052	Oh God!
s03_e21_c04_u053	(entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys! Guess what?
s03_e21_c04_u054	(looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?
s03_e21_c04_u055	Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
s03_e21_c04_u056	Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
s03_e21_c04_u057	Right.
s03_e21_c04_u058	Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
s03_e21_c04_u059	(to Monica) You like it right?
s03_e21_c04_u060	Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. (Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
s03_e21_c04_u061	Yeah, come here!
s03_e21_c04_u062	What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
s03_e21_c04_u063	Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
s03_e21_c04_u064	Okay, good bye! (leaves)
s03_e21_c05_u065	So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
s03_e21_c05_u066	Umm, oh, about three months.
s03_e21_c05_u067	Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
s03_e21_c05_u068	(entering carrying a box) Hey!!
s03_e21_c05_u069	Hey!
s03_e21_c05_u070	I got you something! Open it! Open it!
s03_e21_c05_u071	Okay. (He opens it and it's a baby chick) It's a chicken.
s03_e21_c05_u072	It's cute, huh?
s03_e21_c05_u073	Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
s03_e21_c05_u074	Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
s03_e21_c05_u075	Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
s03_e21_c05_u076	Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight, and talks to it like it's a little baby.)
s03_e21_c05_u077	Easy Lenny.
s03_e21_c06_u078	So? I mean have you thought about it?
s03_e21_c06_u079	Okay. Here's the thing.
s03_e21_c06_u080	Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
s03_e21_c06_u081	I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
s03_e21_c06_u082	Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
s03_e21_c06_u083	Huh?
s03_e21_c06_u084	No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
s03_e21_c06_u085	Oh?
s03_e21_c06_u086	Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
s03_e21_c06_u087	Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
s03_e21_c06_u088	I guess you can.
s03_e21_c06_u089	Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
s03_e21_c06_u090	All right.
s03_e21_c06_u091	Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?
s03_e21_c06_u092	Yeah, sure. Good luck!
s03_e21_c06_u093	(rolling towards the office) I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the door the other way.) I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
s03_e21_c06_u094	(to Pete) Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
s03_e21_c06_u095	What?
s03_e21_c06_u096	I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
s03_e21_c06_u097	Why would you say that?
s03_e21_c06_u098	Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
s03_e21_c06_u099	You're good. You're good!
s03_e21_c06_u100	Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
s03_e21_c06_u101	Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
s03_e21_c06_u102	Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
s03_e21_c06_u103	Thanks a lot.
s03_e21_c06_u104	No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
s03_e21_c07_u105	Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.
s03_e21_c07_u106	Hey.
s03_e21_c07_u107	Hey.
s03_e21_c07_u108	How's she doing?
s03_e21_c07_u109	She?
s03_e21_c07_u110	Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
s03_e21_c07_u111	I don't know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
s03_e21_c07_u112	Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
s03_e21_c07_u113	Excuse me?
s03_e21_c07_u114	What?
s03_e21_c07_u115	I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
s03_e21_c07_u116	Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
s03_e21_c07_u117	You don't think I get up when you get up?
s03_e21_c07_u118	Ohhh, here it comes.
s03_e21_c07_u119	Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
s03_e21_c07_u120	Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
s03_e21_c07_u121	And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
s03_e21_c07_u122	That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
s03_e21_c07_u123	I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
s03_e21_c07_u124	I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
s03_e21_c07_u125	I'll take her back tomorrow.
s03_e21_c07_u126	Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
s03_e21_c07_u127	(entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!
s03_e21_c07_u128	Hey!
s03_e21_c07_u129	(sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This blue suit, or this brown one?
s03_e21_c07_u130	Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
s03_e21_c07_u131	Really? (Joey gives him a Like I would know' look)
s03_e21_c08_u132	(she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)
s03_e21_c08_u133	Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
s03_e21_c08_u134	(She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!
s03_e21_c08_u135	Oh my God, is that still...
s03_e21_c08_u136	I'm fine, I'm fine.
s03_e21_c08_u137	No you're not.
s03_e21_c08_u138	Yes I am!
s03_e21_c08_u139	Rach!
s03_e21_c08_u140	Look, I'm fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes) Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.) Whoa-whoa!
s03_e21_c08_u141	(stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
s03_e21_c08_u142	No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.
s03_e21_c08_u143	And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
s03_e21_c08_u144	Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.
s03_e21_c08_u145	Rach...
s03_e21_c08_u146	But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
s03_e21_c08_u147	Rachel...
s03_e21_c08_u148	Look, either help me or go.
s03_e21_c08_u149	Fine. I'll go.
s03_e21_c08_u150	(with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
s03_e21_c08_u151	(He checks his watch) Sure. I'll help you.
s03_e21_c08_u152	(rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
s03_e21_c09_u153	(She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
s03_e21_c09_u154	Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He doesn't like how it tastes.)
s03_e21_c09_u155	(taking the brush back) Okay. Let's use this brush. (Hands him another one.)
s03_e21_c09_u156	Okay. This stuff?
s03_e21_c09_u157	Yeah.
s03_e21_c09_u158	All right.
s03_e21_c09_u159	Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
s03_e21_c09_u160	Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
s03_e21_c09_u161	Oh-ho!
s03_e21_c09_u162	Sorry.
s03_e21_c09_u163	Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
s03_e21_c09_u164	Sorry, I'm sorry. Close, close, close...
s03_e21_c09_u165	Okay, just sweep it.
s03_e21_c09_u166	I'm sweeping...
s03_e21_c09_u167	Right.
s03_e21_c09_u168	Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she has a black eye.)
s03_e21_c09_u169	Okay, now make it even, cause we don't...
s03_e21_c09_u170	What? What?
s03_e21_c09_u171	We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
s03_e21_c09_u172	No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. (Rachel is shocked) What?
s03_e21_c09_u173	Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
s03_e21_c09_u174	Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)
s03_e21_c09_u175	Blow it.
s03_e21_c09_u176	(blows it) Sorry. Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
s03_e21_c09_u177	Sophisticated like a hooker?
s03_e21_c10_u178	Hey!
s03_e21_c10_u179	Hey!
s03_e21_c10_u180	Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
s03_e21_c10_u181	What?
s03_e21_c10_u182	I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
s03_e21_c10_u183	Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
s03_e21_c10_u184	I know.
s03_e21_c10_u185	Ooh, I have to tell you something.
s03_e21_c10_u186	What?
s03_e21_c10_u187	But I can't tell you.
s03_e21_c10_u188	Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
s03_e21_c10_u189	Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
s03_e21_c10_u190	Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
s03_e21_c10_u191	No.
s03_e21_c10_u192	Does it have to do with Joey?
s03_e21_c10_u193	No.
s03_e21_c10_u194	Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
s03_e21_c10_u195	No, but let's come back to that later!
s03_e21_c11_u196	There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
s03_e21_c11_u197	Sure.
s03_e21_c11_u198	Yep?
s03_e21_c11_u199	Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
s03_e21_c11_u200	Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
s03_e21_c11_u201	Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
s03_e21_c11_u202	(checks his watch) Sure, okay.
s03_e21_c11_u203	Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
s03_e21_c11_u204	What?
s03_e21_c11_u205	I don't want you to see me naked!
s03_e21_c11_u206	Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
s03_e21_c11_u207	Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird.
s03_e21_c11_u208	Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
s03_e21_c11_u209	What?
s03_e21_c11_u210	All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!
s03_e21_c11_u211	Ross! Stop that!
s03_e21_c11_u212	Ah, I'm sorry.
s03_e21_c11_u213	Come on! I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
s03_e21_c11_u214	Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!
s03_e21_c11_u215	Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
s03_e21_c11_u216	Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king.
s03_e21_c11_u217	Rosss...
s03_e21_c11_u218	Come on, would you grow up? It's no big deal.
s03_e21_c11_u219	All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.
s03_e21_c11_u220	Yowzah!!!
s03_e21_c11_u221	O-kay!! See what you did, I'm gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
s03_e21_c11_u222	Aww, come on.
s03_e21_c11_u223	That's it. (She crawls onto the bed) Ow!!!
s03_e21_c11_u224	Oh my God!
s03_e21_c11_u225	Oh-ow!
s03_e21_c11_u226	All right.
s03_e21_c11_u227	Ow!
s03_e21_c11_u228	Look...
s03_e21_c11_u229	Ow!
s03_e21_c11_u230	Okay.
s03_e21_c11_u231	Ow!
s03_e21_c11_u232	Rach?
s03_e21_c11_u233	Ow! Ow!
s03_e21_c11_u234	Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
s03_e21_c11_u235	Okay, I do.
s03_e21_c11_u236	Okay.
s03_e21_c11_u237	I really do.
s03_e21_c11_u238	Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.
s03_e21_c11_u239	Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?
s03_e21_c11_u240	(He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
s03_e21_c11_u241	Okay.
s03_e21_c11_u242	Okay? (goes into the living room)
s03_e21_c11_u243	Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain) Oww!!!! God!
s03_e21_c11_u244	(rushing back in) What?! I wh-, what's wrong?
s03_e21_c11_u245	I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this.
s03_e21_c12_u246	Does it involve travel?
s03_e21_c12_u247	Noo!
s03_e21_c12_u248	Does it involve clogs?
s03_e21_c12_u249	Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
s03_e21_c12_u250	Clogs.
s03_e21_c12_u251	No.
s03_e21_c12_u252	Claws?!
s03_e21_c12_u253	No.
s03_e21_c12_u254	Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
s03_e21_c12_u255	(Shaking her head yes) No!
s03_e21_c12_u256	What is it?! What about Pete?
s03_e21_c12_u257	I don't know! (frantically points at Monica)
s03_e21_c12_u258	Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
s03_e21_c12_u259	I can't!!
s03_e21_c12_u260	Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)
s03_e21_c12_u261	I, but you're so close! No!
s03_e21_c12_u262	Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?
s03_e21_c12_u263	Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!
s03_e21_c13_u264	I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
s03_e21_c13_u265	(entering) Hey!
s03_e21_c13_u266	Hey!
s03_e21_c13_u267	(sees he's watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
s03_e21_c13_u268	I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
s03_e21_c13_u269	If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
s03_e21_c13_u270	Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
s03_e21_c13_u271	Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
s03_e21_c13_u272	That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
s03_e21_c13_u273	Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.
s03_e21_c13_u274	Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
s03_e21_c14_u275	I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
s03_e21_c14_u276	So you like it?
s03_e21_c14_u277	Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)
s03_e21_c14_u278	Oh, you're welcome. (He takes a deep breath)
s03_e21_c14_u279	Did you just smell my hair?
s03_e21_c14_u280	Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
s03_e21_c14_u281	Oh God.
s03_e21_c14_u282	What?
s03_e21_c14_u283	You still have feelings for me don't you?
s03_e21_c14_u284	Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
s03_e21_c14_u285	Pete.
s03_e21_c14_u286	Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
s03_e21_c14_u287	No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice.
s03_e21_c14_u288	Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
s03_e21_c14_u289	You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
s03_e21_c14_u290	What?
s03_e21_c14_u291	And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry.
s03_e21_c14_u292	Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay.
s03_e21_c14_u293	Okay, bye.
s03_e21_c14_u294	I'm sorry things didn't work out...
s03_e21_c14_u295	All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (She kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and kiss, very passionately.)
s03_e21_c15_u296	Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?
s03_e21_c15_u297	Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
s03_e21_c15_u298	Okay.
s03_e21_c15_u299	Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
s03_e21_c15_u300	(to Chandler) That's a duck.
s03_e21_c15_u301	That's a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
s03_e21_c15_u302	Oh, it was, nah, well....
s03_e21_c15_u303	What thing? What thing?
s03_e21_c15_u304	Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her apartment) Easy.
s03_e21_c15_u305	(to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)
s03_e21_c15_u306	What thing? What is this thing?
s03_e21_c15_u307	I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
s03_e21_c15_u308	Oh my God!
s03_e21_c15_u309	Yeah.
s03_e21_c15_u310	Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
s03_e21_c15_u311	Eh, cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
s03_e21_c15_u312	I cannot believe you.
s03_e21_c15_u313	What?
s03_e21_c15_u314	That is the sweetest thing, I just....
s03_e21_c15_u315	(breaking the silence) You should get some sleep.
s03_e21_c15_u316	Okay.
s03_e21_c15_u317	So, I'll umm...
s03_e21_c15_u318	Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening.
s03_e21_c15_u319	No, that's, no, as long as you're okay. So I'll ah, I'll see you tomorrow.
s03_e21_c15_u320	Um-hmm, yeah.
s03_e21_c15_u321	(After he closes the door) See ya.
s03_e21_c15_u322	(coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you do?
s03_e21_c16_u323	What cha doing?
s03_e21_c16_u324	Having a swim.
s03_e21_c16_u325	What about the chick?
s03_e21_c16_u326	Chicks don't swim.
s03_e21_c16_u327	Are you sure?
s03_e21_c16_u328	I don't know. Should we try it?
s03_e21_c16_u329	Sure.
s03_e21_c16_u330	See, I told you they don't swim. (He goes to take it out)
s03_e21_c16_u331	(stopping him) Wait. Give him a minute.
s03_e21_c16_u332	Noo! (takes him out) Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby.
s04_e02_c01_u001	Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
s04_e02_c01_u002	How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
s04_e02_c01_u003	You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
s04_e02_c01_u004	Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
s04_e02_c01_u005	All right, how about we, how bout we sell it.
s04_e02_c01_u006	All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)
s04_e02_c01_u007	(nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!
s04_e02_c02_u008	(on machine) Hey Monica, it's Chip.
s04_e02_c02_u009	Yesss!!
s04_e02_c02_u010	Who's Chip?
s04_e02_c02_u011	Shhh!
s04_e02_c02_u012	(on machine) Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
s04_e02_c02_u013	Chip, is Chip Matthews.
s04_e02_c02_u014	The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
s04_e02_c02_u015	Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
s04_e02_c02_u016	Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
s04_e02_c02_u017	I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! It's Monica. (listens) Kay. (listens) Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)
s04_e02_c02_u018	(to Rachel) I was just leaving.
s04_e02_c02_u019	Good! Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
s04_e02_c02_u020	Why? Did you write it?
s04_e02_c02_u021	(sees Chip's phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
s04_e02_c02_u022	Well ah, actually...
s04_e02_c02_u023	(interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
s04_e02_c02_u024	Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
s04_e02_c02_u025	Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?
s04_e02_c02_u026	Oh, I'm sure.
s04_e02_c02_u027	(on phone) Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens) Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh.
s04_e02_c02_u028	(whispering in her ear) Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
s04_e02_c03_u029	(screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily) Thank you, thanks.
s04_e02_c03_u030	(reading the newspaper) Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
s04_e02_c03_u031	Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
s04_e02_c03_u032	I'm reading your ad.
s04_e02_c03_u033	Looks good, uh?
s04_e02_c03_u034	Yeah.
s04_e02_c03_u035	(reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)
s04_e02_c03_u036	Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
s04_e02_c03_u037	Why? I love that thing.
s04_e02_c03_u038	You want it?
s04_e02_c03_u039	Oh no.
s04_e02_c03_u040	Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
s04_e02_c03_u041	Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
s04_e02_c03_u042	All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
s04_e02_c03_u043	What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
s04_e02_c03_u044	(looks at him) Nooo.
s04_e02_c03_u045	Oh. What do you do?
s04_e02_c03_u046	I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
s04_e02_c03_u047	Yeah, I actually don't know...
s04_e02_c03_u048	Good, so do I
s04_e02_c03_u049	Something to do with numbers?
s04_e02_c03_u050	Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat's eyes) Oh my God.
s04_e02_c03_u051	What?
s04_e02_c03_u052	Nothing. Nothing.
s04_e02_c03_u053	What? What's wrong?
s04_e02_c03_u054	I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
s04_e02_c03_u055	You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
s04_e02_c03_u056	No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
s04_e02_c03_u057	Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
s04_e02_c03_u058	No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an Oh my God. gesture) Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
s04_e02_c03_u059	(to Chandler) Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
s04_e02_c03_u060	(interrupting) Let it go!!
s04_e02_c04_u061	Hey!
s04_e02_c04_u062	Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
s04_e02_c04_u063	Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
s04_e02_c04_u064	Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
s04_e02_c04_u065	What, that little thing at the prom?
s04_e02_c04_u066	Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
s04_e02_c04_u067	Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
s04_e02_c04_u068	I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
s04_e02_c04_u069	Look, you and I went to different high schools...
s04_e02_c04_u070	Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
s04_e02_c04_u071	You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
s04_e02_c04_u072	(shocked) They had to have that specially made?!
s04_e02_c04_u073	It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
s04_e02_c04_u074	(stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
s04_e02_c04_u075	Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
s04_e02_c04_u076	Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)
s04_e02_c04_u077	Oh, really?!
s04_e02_c04_u078	Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
s04_e02_c04_u079	I'll try.
s04_e02_c05_u080	So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
s04_e02_c05_u081	Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
s04_e02_c05_u082	Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
s04_e02_c05_u083	(is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
s04_e02_c05_u084	So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
s04_e02_c05_u085	Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
s04_e02_c05_u086	Why can't you use the phone in here?
s04_e02_c05_u087	Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica's room)
s04_e02_c05_u088	So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
s04_e02_c05_u089	Ross, don't start.
s04_e02_c05_u090	Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
s04_e02_c05_u091	I believe it.
s04_e02_c05_u092	No you don't.
s04_e02_c05_u093	Yes, I do.
s04_e02_c05_u094	No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
s04_e02_c05_u095	Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
s04_e02_c05_u096	I do not always have to be-okay, okay. (starts to leave)
s04_e02_c05_u097	Jurassic Park could happen.
s04_e02_c06_u098	Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
s04_e02_c06_u099	Pretty nice?
s04_e02_c06_u100	You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
s04_e02_c06_u101	We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
s04_e02_c06_u102	Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
s04_e02_c06_u103	You gotta take the canoe!
s04_e02_c06_u104	All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
s04_e02_c06_u105	We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe! (starts to leave as Tony chases after him)
s04_e02_c06_u106	(to Peter) Good for you!!
s04_e02_c07_u107	(entering) You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (She's holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?
s04_e02_c07_u108	(taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
s04_e02_c07_u109	You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
s04_e02_c07_u110	(looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
s04_e02_c07_u111	Do we have to tell her?
s04_e02_c07_u112	Yes, we have to tell her!
s04_e02_c07_u113	Oh, but it's made her so happy.
s04_e02_c07_u114	(holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
s04_e02_c07_u115	(disappointed) Yeah.
s04_e02_c07_u116	Thank you.
s04_e02_c07_u117	I hate when Ross is right!
s04_e02_c07_u118	He is right, isn't he?
s04_e02_c07_u119	Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
s04_e02_c07_u120	You think?
s04_e02_c07_u121	Oh-no, he's right.
s04_e02_c08_u122	(entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)
s04_e02_c08_u123	Hi!
s04_e02_c08_u124	Hey!
s04_e02_c08_u125	Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
s04_e02_c08_u126	Yeah?
s04_e02_c08_u127	(pause) How's that going?
s04_e02_c08_u128	So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
s04_e02_c08_u129	That's so sweet. (pause) I'm gonna get some coffee. (gets up and leaves)
s04_e02_c08_u130	(sliding into Joey's place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe) Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)
s04_e02_c08_u131	Pheebs...
s04_e02_c08_u132	I just feel so, uhh.....
s04_e02_c08_u133	All right!!
s04_e02_c08_u134	I'm coming already!!
s04_e02_c08_u135	Jeez!
s04_e02_c09_u136	(running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)
s04_e02_c09_u137	Hello, Chip.
s04_e02_c09_u138	Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?
s04_e02_c09_u139	I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
s04_e02_c09_u140	So ah, Monica ready yet?
s04_e02_c09_u141	She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
s04_e02_c09_u142	Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
s04_e02_c10_u143	This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
s04_e02_c10_u144	What?!
s04_e02_c10_u145	Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
s04_e02_c10_u146	No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
s04_e02_c10_u147	Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
s04_e02_c10_u148	All right, you have yourself a deal. (shakes his hand)
s04_e02_c10_u149	Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya!
s04_e02_c10_u150	Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
s04_e02_c11_u151	Here, we are.
s04_e02_c11_u152	Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
s04_e02_c11_u153	The what?
s04_e02_c11_u154	That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
s04_e02_c11_u155	No, I think it's cute. (kisses her)
s04_e02_c11_u156	Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
s04_e02_c11_u157	So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
s04_e02_c11_u158	Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
s04_e02_c11_u159	Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
s04_e02_c11_u160	Is that all?
s04_e02_c11_u161	Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
s04_e02_c11_u162	Ohh, how is he?
s04_e02_c11_u163	Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
s04_e02_c11_u164	Isn't he an architect now?
s04_e02_c11_u165	Yeah, they still wear underwear.
s04_e02_c12_u166	OH MY GOD!!!
s04_e02_c12_u167	(still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!!
s04_e02_c12_u168	Are you all right?!
s04_e02_c12_u169	Yeah...
s04_e02_c12_u170	(lets him out) What happened?!!
s04_e02_c12_u171	(getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
s04_e02_c12_u172	What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
s04_e02_c12_u173	Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
s04_e02_c12_u174	So-You got in voluntarily?!
s04_e02_c12_u175	I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
s04_e02_c12_u176	BEND OVER?!!!
s04_e02_c13_u177	...and then Zana, just let one rip!! (laughs histerically)
s04_e02_c13_u178	Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
s04_e02_c13_u179	You know where I work!
s04_e02_c13_u180	I do?
s04_e02_c13_u181	The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
s04_e02_c13_u182	You still work at the multiplex?
s04_e02_c13_u183	Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
s04_e02_c13_u184	Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
s04_e02_c13_u185	Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
s04_e02_c14_u186	Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
s04_e02_c14_u187	Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
s04_e02_c14_u188	(looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
s04_e02_c14_u189	(entering) Oh my God! What happened?
s04_e02_c14_u190	Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
s04_e02_c14_u191	(to Monica) So, how was your date?
s04_e02_c14_u192	Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
s04_e02_c14_u193	Um-hmm.
s04_e02_c14_u194	Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
s04_e02_c14_u195	Oh honey, I'm sorry.
s04_e02_c14_u196	No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
s04_e02_c14_u197	Ohh! That's so great!
s04_e02_c14_u198	I know!
s04_e02_c14_u199	(entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
s04_e02_c14_u200	Oh, they said uh, You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us.
s04_e02_c14_u201	(seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn't tell her?! (They all kinda shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?
s04_e02_c14_u202	Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!
s04_e02_c14_u203	Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
s04_e02_c14_u204	I'm sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)
s04_e02_c14_u205	Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
s04_e02_c14_u206	Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
s04_e02_c14_u207	That's a good call. Right.
s04_e02_c14_u208	No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
s04_e02_c14_u209	(she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross, how many parents have you lost?
s04_e02_c14_u210	None.
s04_e02_c14_u211	Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
s04_e02_c14_u212	I'm sorry.
s04_e02_c14_u213	Okay.
s04_e02_c14_u214	I don't know what to say.
s04_e02_c14_u215	You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
s04_e02_c14_u216	I think she would like that.
s04_e02_c14_u217	(goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
s04_e02_c14_u218	Thank you. We both forgive you.
s04_e02_c14_u219	So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
s04_e02_c14_u220	Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
s04_e02_c14_u221	Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)
s04_e02_c14_u222	Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
s04_e02_c14_u223	I'll go with you.
s04_e02_c14_u224	Me too. (they all leave)
s04_e02_c14_u225	Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
s04_e02_c14_u226	Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
s06_e13_c01_u001	Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.
s06_e13_c01_u002	This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
s06_e13_c01_u003	Hi!
s06_e13_c01_u004	Hi!
s06_e13_c01_u005	How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
s06_e13_c01_u006	Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
s06_e13_c01_u007	Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
s06_e13_c01_u008	Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
s06_e13_c01_u009	Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
s06_e13_c01_u010	It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
s06_e13_c01_u011	Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
s06_e13_c01_u012	Yeah Joey that is so gross!
s06_e13_c01_u013	How about a scone on the house baby?
s06_e13_c01_u014	(giggles) I'm pretty.
s06_e13_c02_u015	Hey does anyone have any gum?
s06_e13_c02_u016	Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y'know what? No. (Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming in it.) I know it's in here somewhere.
s06_e13_c02_u017	Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
s06_e13_c02_u018	(entering) Hey!
s06_e13_c02_u019	Hey!
s06_e13_c02_u020	Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
s06_e13_c02_u021	(congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
s06_e13_c02_u022	I'm so sorry you're sick.
s06_e13_c02_u023	I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
s06_e13_c02_u024	Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica's nose, as does Joey.)
s06_e13_c02_u025	(wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.)
s06_e13_c02_u026	I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
s06_e13_c02_u027	I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
s06_e13_c02_u028	When you put a D' at the end of Fine' you're not fine.
s06_e13_c02_u029	I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
s06_e13_c02_u030	Yes?
s06_e13_c02_u031	Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
s06_e13_c02_u032	Oh my God, Jill!
s06_e13_c02_u033	Oh my God, Rachel!
s06_e13_c02_u034	Oh my God, introduce us!
s06_e13_c02_u035	This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
s06_e13_c02_u036	Hi!
s06_e13_c02_u037	And you know Monica and Ross!
s06_e13_c02_u038	Hi Jill.
s06_e13_c02_u039	And that's Phoebe (points), and that's Joey.
s06_e13_c02_u040	Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin'?
s06_e13_c02_u041	Don't!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are you doing here?!
s06_e13_c02_u042	(To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
s06_e13_c02_u043	(To Rachel) Daddy cut me off.
s06_e13_c02_u044	Never mind, I got it.
s06_e13_c02_u045	And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
s06_e13_c02_u046	Wow! What did he say?
s06_e13_c02_u047	That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
s06_e13_c02_u048	Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
s06_e13_c02_u049	Rach? (Points to Jill.)
s06_e13_c02_u050	Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
s06_e13_c02_u051	Okay, I bought a boat.
s06_e13_c02_u052	You bought a boat?
s06_e13_c02_u053	Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
s06_e13_c02_u054	Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.)
s06_e13_c02_u055	Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
s06_e13_c02_u056	Of course, yeah!
s06_e13_c02_u057	Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
s06_e13_c02_u058	Ooh, I like cards.
s06_e13_c03_u059	(to a customer) Are you all finished here?
s06_e13_c03_u060	Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)
s06_e13_c03_u061	Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
s06_e13_c03_u062	What?!
s06_e13_c03_u063	For all the free food you gave away.
s06_e13_c03_u064	Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
s06_e13_c03_u065	We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
s06_e13_c03_u066	Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
s06_e13_c03_u067	No!
s06_e13_c03_u068	(to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)
s06_e13_c03_u069	(entering, carrying a bunch of shopping bags) I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy. (Sets them down.)
s06_e13_c03_u070	Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
s06_e13_c03_u071	Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! (Holds up a red sweater) This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. (Holds up a pair of black pants) And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
s06_e13_c03_u072	I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
s06_e13_c03_u073	Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
s06_e13_c03_u074	Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
s06_e13_c03_u075	So who made her queen of the world?
s06_e13_c03_u076	I would love that job!
s06_e13_c03_u077	(entering) Hey! What's goin' on?
s06_e13_c03_u078	Hey!
s06_e13_c03_u079	(notices Jill's bags) Jill! Did you shop?!
s06_e13_c03_u080	No! They did! (Points to Phoebe and Ross)
s06_e13_c03_u081	You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
s06_e13_c03_u082	Sorry Jill.
s06_e13_c03_u083	Sorry-sorry Jill.
s06_e13_c03_u084	What'd you get?
s06_e13_c03_u085	Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater." (Holds up the same sweater.)
s06_e13_c03_u086	Oh.
s06_e13_c03_u087	And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
s06_e13_c03_u088	Apartment pants?
s06_e13_c03_u089	Yeah, you never heard of them?
s06_e13_c03_u090	No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
s06_e13_c03_u091	Huh? Oh, I got this-(Holds up this pink frilly thing)-this!
s06_e13_c03_u092	A pajmena?
s06_e13_c03_u093	Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
s06_e13_c03_u094	Really?
s06_e13_c03_u095	Ross, wants a pajmena?
s06_e13_c03_u096	It's a rug. (Jill winces.)
s06_e13_c03_u097	Jill?
s06_e13_c03_u098	(covers her eyes and starts crying) I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry
s06_e13_c03_u099	Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
s06_e13_c03_u100	Right! But, I am sorry.
s06_e13_c03_u101	All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.) And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of Jill's stuff.)
s06_e13_c03_u102	She took all my stuff.
s06_e13_c03_u103	Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)
s06_e13_c03_u104	(gasps) That's the best one! Oh my God, (hugs him) thank you so much!
s06_e13_c03_u105	Well. Hey
s06_e13_c03_u106	Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
s06_e13_c03_u107	Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "I'm sorry!"
s06_e13_c03_u108	(hits him) Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
s06_e13_c03_u109	What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
s06_e13_c03_u110	Were you this cute in high school?
s06_e13_c03_u111	Oh stop.
s06_e13_c03_u112	No you stop!
s06_e13_c03_u113	No, you stop!
s06_e13_c03_u114	You stop!
s06_e13_c03_u115	(gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
s06_e13_c04_u116	Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
s06_e13_c04_u117	I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of orange juice.)
s06_e13_c04_u118	Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
s06_e13_c04_u119	That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here. (Points to his nose.)
s06_e13_c04_u120	(wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn't work all that well with the big robe.)
s06_e13_c04_u121	Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
s06_e13_c04_u122	(in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)
s06_e13_c04_u123	Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
s06_e13_c04_u124	I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
s06_e13_c04_u125	That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
s06_e13_c05_u126	Hey!
s06_e13_c05_u127	Hey.
s06_e13_c05_u128	What's up?!
s06_e13_c05_u129	Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
s06_e13_c05_u130	Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
s06_e13_c05_u131	No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
s06_e13_c05_u132	What?!
s06_e13_c05_u133	Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
s06_e13_c05_u134	With Ross and Jill?
s06_e13_c05_u135	Yeah!
s06_e13_c05_u136	With Ross and my sister?
s06_e13_c05_u137	Yeah.
s06_e13_c05_u138	With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
s06_e13_c05_u139	Yeah.
s06_e13_c05_u140	Oh there is no way.
s06_e13_c05_u141	Okay then.
s06_e13_c05_u142	Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
s06_e13_c05_u143	But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
s06_e13_c06_u144	That'll be $3.85.
s06_e13_c06_u145	What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
s06_e13_c06_u146	It's just I can't because my manager said I- (Gets an idea) (Starts singing) "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie
s06_e13_c06_u147	Amy!
s06_e13_c06_u148	(still singing) "-Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
s06_e13_c06_u149	Yeah, not it here it isn't.
s06_e13_c06_u150	(entering) Sorry I'm late, what's up?
s06_e13_c06_u151	(on the couch) Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
s06_e13_c06_u152	Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
s06_e13_c06_u153	That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
s06_e13_c06_u154	Yeah.
s06_e13_c06_u155	Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
s06_e13_c06_u156	Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
s06_e13_c06_u157	I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
s06_e13_c06_u158	No! I mean he's nice.
s06_e13_c06_u159	Yeah.
s06_e13_c06_u160	He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
s06_e13_c06_u161	Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
s06_e13_c06_u162	Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
s06_e13_c06_u163	Are-are you saying he's a geek?
s06_e13_c06_u164	You think so too?
s06_e13_c06_u165	No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
s06_e13_c06_u166	Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
s06_e13_c06_u167	What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
s06_e13_c06_u168	Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
s06_e13_c06_u169	Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
s06_e13_c06_u170	No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
s06_e13_c06_u171	Yeah but, he's not your type.
s06_e13_c06_u172	Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
s06_e13_c06_u173	Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
s06_e13_c06_u174	What?
s06_e13_c06_u175	She-she died Jill.
s06_e13_c07_u176	(still sick) Chandler!
s06_e13_c07_u177	Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. Or at least she's trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!
s06_e13_c07_u178	(trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
s06_e13_c07_u179	Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
s06_e13_c07_u180	How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
s06_e13_c07_u181	I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
s06_e13_c07_u182	Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.)
s06_e13_c07_u183	Would you please get some rest!
s06_e13_c07_u184	I'm fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)
s06_e13_c08_u185	(singing) "Happy birthday to you!"
s06_e13_c08_u186	You're paying for that.
s06_e13_c08_u187	What? No-no it's her birthday!
s06_e13_c08_u188	You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
s06_e13_c08_u189	But it really
s06_e13_c08_u190	You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
s06_e13_c08_u191	Damnit! (Storms off.)
s06_e13_c08_u192	(entering) Rach? Hi!
s06_e13_c08_u193	Hi!
s06_e13_c08_u194	Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
s06_e13_c08_u195	Well yeah
s06_e13_c08_u196	Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
s06_e13_c08_u197	Really?!
s06_e13_c08_u198	Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
s06_e13_c08_u199	Oh so-so not really never.
s06_e13_c08_u200	I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
s06_e13_c08_u201	(overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!
s06_e13_c09_u202	(entering) Chandler, I think I'm sick.
s06_e13_c09_u203	Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
s06_e13_c09_u204	Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)
s06_e13_c09_u205	No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
s06_e13_c09_u206	Come on! I really need your help!
s06_e13_c09_u207	No-no-no-no-no!
s06_e13_c09_u208	Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
s06_e13_c09_u209	Okay.
s06_e13_c09_u210	So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
s06_e13_c09_u211	Yeah?
s06_e13_c09_u212	It's nice.
s06_e13_c09_u213	Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
s06_e13_c09_u214	Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)
s06_e13_c09_u215	I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
s06_e13_c09_u216	It's all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
s06_e13_c09_u217	Not now, I'm sick!
s06_e13_c09_u218	Oh come on you big faker!
s06_e13_c09_u219	What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
s06_e13_c09_u220	Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
s06_e13_c09_u221	Okay, if you really wanna have sex
s06_e13_c09_u222	Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)
s06_e13_c09_u223	Worked like a charm.
s06_e13_c10_u224	(entering) Hi!
s06_e13_c10_u225	Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
s06_e13_c10_u226	This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think? (She spins to show Rachel the outfit she's wearing.)
s06_e13_c10_u227	Well, I-I don't like it.
s06_e13_c10_u228	Really?!
s06_e13_c10_u229	It's kinda slutty.
s06_e13_c10_u230	It's yours!
s06_e13_c10_u231	Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut.
s06_e13_c10_u232	(laughs) Me too.
s06_e13_c10_u233	(entering) Hi Jill!
s06_e13_c10_u234	Hey!
s06_e13_c10_u235	Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
s06_e13_c10_u236	Rachel.
s06_e13_c10_u237	Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here.
s06_e13_c10_u238	Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!
s06_e13_c10_u239	Okay. So well I'll umm, (To Rachel) I'll have her home by midnight.
s06_e13_c11_u240	Why aren't you home yet?!
s06_e13_c11_u241	(calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?
s06_e13_c11_u242	Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!
s06_e13_c11_u243	(calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?
s06_e13_c11_u244	Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
s06_e13_c11_u245	We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
s06_e13_c11_u246	(gasps) Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
s06_e13_c11_u247	(entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Ross's apartment) Is that your sister?
s06_e13_c11_u248	Ugh, she is a slut!
s06_e13_c11_u249	God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
s06_e13_c11_u250	Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!
s06_e13_c11_u251	He's taking off her coat!
s06_e13_c11_u252	Oh, this is just terrible.
s06_e13_c11_u253	Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna-(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)
s06_e13_c11_u254	Oh. (Squeaks again.)
s06_e13_c11_u255	Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well, I'm off to bed! (Goes to bed.)
s04_e18_c01_u001	Hey!
s04_e18_c01_u002	Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
s04_e18_c01_u003	(not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
s04_e18_c01_u004	All right.
s04_e18_c01_u005	Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
s04_e18_c01_u006	Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
s04_e18_c01_u007	I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!
s04_e18_c01_u008	(entering) Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
s04_e18_c01_u009	Hey! What are you doing here?
s04_e18_c01_u010	Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
s04_e18_c01_u011	Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
s04_e18_c01_u012	(laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
s04_e18_c01_u013	Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
s04_e18_c01_u014	Don't get me started. (To Phoebe) Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
s04_e18_c01_u015	Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
s04_e18_c01_u016	You think about it. (Leaves)
s04_e18_c02_u017	I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
s04_e18_c02_u018	Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
s04_e18_c02_u019	(checks the clock) Ohh, it's time to go.
s04_e18_c02_u020	Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
s04_e18_c02_u021	Well that's ambitious.
s04_e18_c02_u022	Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
s04_e18_c02_u023	That's Carol with your son!
s04_e18_c02_u024	Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand.
s04_e18_c02_u025	(knocking on the door) Ross!
s04_e18_c02_u026	I'll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol, Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
s04_e18_c02_u027	Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!
s04_e18_c02_u028	Me too!
s04_e18_c02_u029	Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
s04_e18_c02_u030	Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there.
s04_e18_c02_u031	Oh, well, I'll show you around.
s04_e18_c02_u032	That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions
s04_e18_c02_u033	Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!
s04_e18_c02_u034	Ahh!
s04_e18_c02_u035	Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so
s04_e18_c02_u036	Are you all right?
s04_e18_c02_u037	Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me.
s04_e18_c02_u038	Oh come on! That's-that's- true.
s04_e18_c03_u039	Hi!
s04_e18_c03_u040	Hey!
s04_e18_c03_u041	Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
s04_e18_c03_u042	Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a book) and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon.
s04_e18_c03_u043	Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
s04_e18_c03_u044	Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
s04_e18_c03_u045	No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
s04_e18_c03_u046	Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they're hanging out with Joey."
s04_e18_c03_u047	Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn't think so.) Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.
s04_e18_c03_u048	Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
s04_e18_c03_u049	Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
s04_e18_c03_u050	What do ya say? What do ya say?
s04_e18_c03_u051	Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
s04_e18_c03_u052	I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
s04_e18_c04_u053	Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She's holding two frilly, lace nighties.)
s04_e18_c04_u054	Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
s04_e18_c04_u055	Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
s04_e18_c04_u056	Um-hmm.
s04_e18_c04_u057	What am I making him by the way?
s04_e18_c04_u058	Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
s04_e18_c04_u059	I thought I was making him filet mignon?
s04_e18_c04_u060	Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it, then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
s04_e18_c04_u061	Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
s04_e18_c05_u062	Hey!
s04_e18_c05_u063	Hey!
s04_e18_c05_u064	Hey!
s04_e18_c05_u065	So uh, Emily called last night
s04_e18_c05_u066	And now you're giving me the message!
s04_e18_c05_u067	Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!
s04_e18_c05_u068	God, Susan is so fun!
s04_e18_c05_u069	Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
s04_e18_c05_u070	You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
s04_e18_c05_u071	Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?
s04_e18_c05_u072	No, but I'm gonna!
s04_e18_c05_u073	Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
s04_e18_c05_u074	How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
s04_e18_c05_u075	Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
s04_e18_c05_u076	What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
s04_e18_c05_u077	No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
s04_e18_c05_u078	Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
s04_e18_c05_u079	Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know
s04_e18_c05_u080	Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found- (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian. (Leaves.)
s04_e18_c05_u081	So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
s04_e18_c05_u082	Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
s04_e18_c05_u083	Raymond Chandler.
s04_e18_c05_u084	Someone you didn't make up!
s04_e18_c05_u085	Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
s04_e18_c05_u086	Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
s04_e18_c05_u087	Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?
s04_e18_c05_u088	Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.
s04_e18_c05_u089	All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!
s04_e18_c05_u090	Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
s04_e18_c05_u091	I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.)
s04_e18_c05_u092	Okay.
s04_e18_c05_u093	So I guess it's Joey then!
s04_e18_c06_u094	This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
s04_e18_c06_u095	Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!
s04_e18_c06_u096	Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
s04_e18_c06_u097	(taking a bite) Hmmm!
s04_e18_c06_u098	Oh my God!
s04_e18_c06_u099	Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good.
s04_e18_c06_u100	Behind you?
s04_e18_c06_u101	(sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
s04_e18_c06_u102	(getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It's just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
s04_e18_c06_u103	Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
s04_e18_c06_u104	(answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings them inside.)
s04_e18_c06_u105	All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
s04_e18_c06_u106	Yeah, it's-it's my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would've told you about it, but I didn't know they would be here.
s04_e18_c06_u107	Oh.
s04_e18_c06_u108	So, all right.
s04_e18_c06_u109	Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What? (She sees that Joshua isn't relaxed.)
s04_e18_c06_u110	Nothing I uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
s04_e18_c06_u111	But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
s04_e18_c06_u112	Okay, that's-that's not funny. Uhh.
s04_e18_c06_u113	Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
s04_e18_c06_u114	Oh, they're working on this week, it's a total mess. But uh, I'm staying at my parents' house, we could go there.
s04_e18_c06_u115	Your parents'?
s04_e18_c06_u116	Yeah, they're out of town.
s04_e18_c06_u117	Ohh.
s04_e18_c06_u118	Yeah-yeah, it's this huge place, and-and it's got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
s04_e18_c06_u119	Yeah that works.
s04_e18_c06_u120	They-they-they can smell fear.
s04_e18_c07_u121	(opening the door.) Hey!
s04_e18_c07_u122	Hey! How's Ben?
s04_e18_c07_u123	Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he's sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)
s04_e18_c07_u124	Hey, Ben! Hey!
s04_e18_c07_u125	So umm, any word from Susan?
s04_e18_c07_u126	Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily.
s04_e18_c07_u127	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
s04_e18_c07_u128	What's too much fun?
s04_e18_c07_u129	Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.
s04_e18_c07_u130	Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
s04_e18_c07_u131	Am I?!
s04_e18_c07_u132	Yes!
s04_e18_c07_u133	Am I?!
s04_e18_c07_u134	I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
s04_e18_c07_u135	Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else- There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
s04_e18_c07_u136	Maybe.
s04_e18_c07_u137	OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
s04_e18_c08_u138	and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!
s04_e18_c08_u139	Wow! This place is fabulous!
s04_e18_c08_u140	Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
s04_e18_c08_u141	Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
s04_e18_c08_u142	Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
s04_e18_c08_u143	Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
s04_e18_c08_u144	Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
s04_e18_c08_u145	That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
s04_e18_c08_u146	Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left.
s04_e18_c08_u147	Ah.
s04_e18_c08_u148	Oh, hi, darling!
s04_e18_c08_u149	Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
s04_e18_c08_u150	Oh, well we cut the trip short.
s04_e18_c08_u151	France sucks!
s04_e18_c08_u152	Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
s04_e18_c08_u153	Oh, say no more!
s04_e18_c08_u154	We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair.
s04_e18_c08_u155	Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
s04_e18_c08_u156	Yep, sucks!
s04_e18_c08_u157	Hi you!
s04_e18_c08_u158	Oh my God!
s04_e18_c08_u159	I know, I can do more than cook.
s04_e18_c08_u160	I like her. She sees smart.
s04_e18_c09_u161	Uhh, Rachel, my parents
s04_e18_c09_u162	Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their hands.) Hello.
s04_e18_c09_u163	Hi.
s04_e18_c09_u164	Hello.
s04_e18_c09_u165	Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
s04_e18_c09_u166	What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so- And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
s04_e18_c09_u167	Maybe in L.A?
s04_e18_c09_u168	Yes!
s04_e18_c09_u169	There you go.
s04_e18_c09_u170	So, have you kids eaten yet?
s04_e18_c09_u171	Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next.
s04_e18_c09_u172	Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
s04_e18_c09_u173	Oh, yeah, well- Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house.
s04_e18_c09_u174	So- We go eat.
s04_e18_c09_u175	Yes.
s04_e18_c09_u176	You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that.
s04_e18_c10_u177	Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
s04_e18_c10_u178	No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!
s04_e18_c10_u179	It's not that bad.
s04_e18_c10_u180	Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
s04_e18_c10_u181	So, you're just Bing?
s04_e18_c10_u182	I have no name.
s04_e18_c10_u183	All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
s04_e18_c10_u184	Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
s04_e18_c10_u185	No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
s04_e18_c10_u186	Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
s04_e18_c10_u187	Umm, Gene.
s04_e18_c10_u188	It's Clint. It's Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)
s04_e18_c10_u189	See you later, Gene.
s04_e18_c10_u190	Bye, Gene.
s04_e18_c10_u191	It's Clint! Clint!
s04_e18_c10_u192	What's up with Gene?
s04_e18_c11_u193	So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
s04_e18_c11_u194	Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
s04_e18_c11_u195	Oh my God!
s04_e18_c11_u196	Oh, no!
s04_e18_c11_u197	No, it's all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there heads in agreement.)
s04_e18_c11_u198	(returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
s04_e18_c11_u199	So?
s04_e18_c11_u200	So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
s04_e18_c11_u201	Emily's straight.
s04_e18_c11_u202	Oh, wake up!
s04_e18_c11_u203	Wow, Carol really messed you up!
s04_e18_c11_u204	Excuse me?
s04_e18_c11_u205	Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
s04_e18_c11_u206	Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
s04_e18_c11_u207	Huh.
s04_e18_c11_u208	What?
s04_e18_c11_u209	She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
s04_e18_c11_u210	This totally makes sense!
s04_e18_c11_u211	It does not!
s04_e18_c11_u212	Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
s04_e18_c11_u213	All right, all right, so up until 92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
s04_e18_c11_u214	Absolutely! Absolutely!
s04_e18_c11_u215	This is so much fun!
s04_e18_c11_u216	This is not fun!
s04_e18_c11_u217	Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
s04_e18_c11_u218	Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
s04_e18_c11_u219	Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
s04_e18_c11_u220	What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
s04_e18_c12_u221	Drum roll.
s04_e18_c12_u222	(entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
s04_e18_c12_u223	Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
s04_e18_c12_u224	All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
s04_e18_c12_u225	You're actually going through with this?
s04_e18_c12_u226	Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women- So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
s04_e18_c12_u227	You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, (To Joey) I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
s04_e18_c12_u228	(pleased) Really?!
s04_e18_c12_u229	Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
s04_e18_c12_u230	Okay. Thanks.
s04_e18_c12_u231	Okay!
s04_e18_c12_u232	You wanna hug it out?
s04_e18_c12_u233	Yeah!
s04_e18_c12_u234	Yay!
s04_e18_c12_u235	Yay!
s04_e18_c12_u236	Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
s04_e18_c12_u237	Okay!
s04_e18_c12_u238	Ooh, uh- (She grabs her coat and runs out.)
s04_e18_c12_u239	Bye, Pheebs!
s04_e18_c12_u240	Okay, bye!
s04_e18_c12_u241	Ha! Ha! Ha!
s04_e18_c12_u242	Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby Chandler.)
s04_e18_c13_u243	Nice luggage.
s04_e18_c13_u244	I was gonna say
s04_e18_c13_u245	Hey!
s04_e18_c13_u246	Hi!
s04_e18_c13_u247	Hey! I missed you.
s04_e18_c13_u248	Oh, I missed you too.
s04_e18_c13_u249	(To Emily) Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
s04_e18_c13_u250	Oh, so did I.
s04_e18_c13_u251	(To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)
s03_e19_c01_u001	Here you go.
s03_e19_c01_u002	Thank you.
s03_e19_c01_u003	(In his head) Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.
s03_e19_c01_u004	(entering) Hi!
s03_e19_c01_u005	Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!
s03_e19_c01_u006	Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say.
s03_e19_c01_u007	Oh, okay.
s03_e19_c01_u008	I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now.
s03_e19_c01_u009	Wow! Umm....
s03_e19_c01_u010	I dropped a cup.
s03_e19_c02_u011	...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, Wash my car.' Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying.
s03_e19_c02_u012	Oh, this is so great.
s03_e19_c02_u013	Yeah, it was.
s03_e19_c02_u014	All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.
s03_e19_c02_u015	Hello, people who do not live here.
s03_e19_c02_u016	Hi! Hello!
s03_e19_c02_u017	I gave you a key for emergencies!
s03_e19_c02_u018	We were out of Doritos.
s03_e19_c02_u019	Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
s03_e19_c02_u020	Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
s03_e19_c02_u021	He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!
s03_e19_c02_u022	Still?!
s03_e19_c02_u023	Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
s03_e19_c02_u024	Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
s03_e19_c02_u025	Two.
s03_e19_c02_u026	Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
s03_e19_c02_u027	(entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table and exits)
s03_e19_c02_u028	I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
s03_e19_c02_u029	Oh.
s03_e19_c02_u030	Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
s03_e19_c03_u031	Joe. How's it going?
s03_e19_c03_u032	Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast member.) Hey.
s03_e19_c03_u033	Hi.
s03_e19_c03_u034	Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?
s03_e19_c03_u035	Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
s03_e19_c03_u036	Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni.
s03_e19_c03_u037	Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller.
s03_e19_c03_u038	So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?
s03_e19_c03_u039	Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.
s03_e19_c03_u040	Oh, forget about it. She rocks!
s03_e19_c03_u041	Where do I know you from?
s03_e19_c03_u042	Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
s03_e19_c03_u043	No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?
s03_e19_c03_u044	Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
s03_e19_c03_u045	That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
s03_e19_c03_u046	See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting.
s03_e19_c03_u047	Yeah, that was real.
s03_e19_c04_u048	Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
s03_e19_c04_u049	I know.
s03_e19_c04_u050	What, so what are you gonna tell him?
s03_e19_c04_u051	Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
s03_e19_c04_u052	Huh.
s03_e19_c04_u053	I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
s03_e19_c04_u054	Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
s03_e19_c04_u055	I don't have any issues with my Father.
s03_e19_c04_u056	Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then.
s03_e19_c05_u057	I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me.
s03_e19_c05_u058	(entering) Hello.
s03_e19_c05_u059	Hey!
s03_e19_c05_u060	So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
s03_e19_c05_u061	Wow, what-what do you think she wants?
s03_e19_c05_u062	Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
s03_e19_c05_u063	It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.
s03_e19_c05_u064	Then be supportive like a guy.
s03_e19_c05_u065	(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
s03_e19_c06_u066	Hi.
s03_e19_c06_u067	Hi!
s03_e19_c06_u068	You ah, wanted to see me?
s03_e19_c06_u069	Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)
s03_e19_c06_u070	What?!
s03_e19_c06_u071	Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here.
s03_e19_c06_u072	What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
s03_e19_c06_u073	No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?
s03_e19_c06_u074	Yes.
s03_e19_c06_u075	Yeah?
s03_e19_c06_u076	Yes, I do.
s03_e19_c06_u077	Good.
s03_e19_c06_u078	Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!
s03_e19_c06_u079	Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
s03_e19_c06_u080	It's still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
s03_e19_c06_u081	Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug.
s03_e19_c06_u082	No!! Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours. In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
s03_e19_c06_u083	You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
s03_e19_c06_u084	I'm just trying to help you, move on.
s03_e19_c06_u085	Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
s03_e19_c06_u086	Petty...
s03_e19_c06_u087	Petty... (goes into her room)
s03_e19_c06_u088	Petty...
s03_e19_c06_u089	Petty...
s03_e19_c06_u090	Petty...
s03_e19_c06_u091	Small...
s03_e19_c06_u092	Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)
s03_e19_c06_u093	You are so just doing this out of spite.
s03_e19_c06_u094	Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
s03_e19_c06_u095	Huh?
s03_e19_c06_u096	I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)
s03_e19_c06_u097	You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
s03_e19_c06_u098	Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
s03_e19_c06_u099	(imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
s03_e19_c06_u100	Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It's an old Frankie says relax' T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)
s03_e19_c07_u101	So, you're like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)
s03_e19_c07_u102	And you're our age. You're our age.
s03_e19_c07_u103	Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
s03_e19_c07_u104	What like Pete Dakota?
s03_e19_c07_u105	Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.
s03_e19_c07_u106	Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
s03_e19_c07_u107	That's not a state Joe.
s03_e19_c07_u108	Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?
s03_e19_c07_u109	I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later.
s03_e19_c07_u110	Okay.
s03_e19_c07_u111	You're our age!
s03_e19_c07_u112	(to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?
s03_e19_c07_u113	Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!
s03_e19_c07_u114	Yeah, kinda.
s03_e19_c08_u115	Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
s03_e19_c08_u116	Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. (He kisses her) Nothing.
s03_e19_c08_u117	Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice.
s03_e19_c08_u118	I have a question about this scene.
s03_e19_c08_u119	Yes?
s03_e19_c08_u120	Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.
s03_e19_c08_u121	Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.
s03_e19_c08_u122	Yeah.
s03_e19_c08_u123	I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
s03_e19_c08_u124	Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
s03_e19_c08_u125	It doesn't say that in the script.
s03_e19_c08_u126	It does in mine!
s03_e19_c09_u127	I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?
s03_e19_c09_u128	You bug me.
s03_e19_c09_u129	Is there any chance you didn't see that?
s03_e19_c10_u130	Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
s03_e19_c10_u131	I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
s03_e19_c10_u132	You didn't just break up.
s03_e19_c10_u133	Hey, it's been like three weeks!
s03_e19_c10_u134	You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
s03_e19_c10_u135	Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in.
s03_e19_c10_u136	Okay.
s03_e19_c10_u137	She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!
s03_e19_c10_u138	And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
s03_e19_c10_u139	Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
s03_e19_c10_u140	Stop what?!
s03_e19_c10_u141	I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
s03_e19_c10_u142	No!! You can't!!
s03_e19_c10_u143	Look, they must be stopped!
s03_e19_c10_u144	I need juice! People need juice!!
s03_e19_c10_u145	Look man!
s03_e19_c10_u146	People need juice!
s03_e19_c10_u147	Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)
s03_e19_c10_u148	Juice, I need...
s03_e19_c10_u149	She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over.
s03_e19_c10_u150	Yeah, okay.
s03_e19_c10_u151	Okay.
s03_e19_c10_u152	It's just I miss her so much.
s03_e19_c10_u153	I know. (He rubs Ross's head)
s03_e19_c11_u154	Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
s03_e19_c11_u155	Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Where's number 27?!'
s03_e19_c11_u156	Y'know what?
s03_e19_c11_u157	No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
s03_e19_c11_u158	I can't do this.
s03_e19_c11_u159	Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know.
s03_e19_c11_u160	Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you.
s03_e19_c11_u161	Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!
s03_e19_c11_u162	Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
s03_e19_c11_u163	That's okay.
s03_e19_c11_u164	You sure?
s03_e19_c11_u165	Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
s03_e19_c12_u166	...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...
s03_e19_c12_u167	(to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?
s03_e19_c12_u168	Sure.
s03_e19_c12_u169	Where are we?
s03_e19_c12_u170	(looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo.
s03_e19_c12_u171	Just tell me the truth.
s03_e19_c12_u172	Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.
s03_e19_c12_u173	Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?
s03_e19_c12_u174	So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
s03_e19_c12_u175	Oh, yeah. I know that.
s03_e19_c12_u176	I so wanna be attracted to you.
s03_e19_c12_u177	But you're not. Okay, good.
s03_e19_c12_u178	I'm sorry.
s03_e19_c12_u179	Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, cause it's not so bad.
s03_e19_c12_u180	It's not?
s03_e19_c12_u181	Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too.
s03_e19_c12_u182	Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? Cause this place is kinda depressing. (they start to leave)
s03_e19_c12_u183	And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
s03_e19_c12_u184	(to Monica) One second.
s03_e19_c13_u185	I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)
s03_e19_c13_u186	(to Joey) I wasn't doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?
s03_e19_c13_u187	Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
s03_e19_c13_u188	Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
s03_e19_c13_u189	God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, Oh, I'm so talented.' and Oh, I'm so pretty,' and Ooh, I smell so good.'
s03_e19_c13_u190	I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
s03_e19_c13_u191	Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
s03_e19_c13_u192	I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.
s03_e19_c13_u193	Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind.
s03_e19_c13_u194	Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
s03_e19_c13_u195	Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
s03_e19_c14_u196	Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
s03_e19_c14_u197	Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.
s03_e19_c14_u198	You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
s03_e19_c14_u199	Well, that was ah...
s03_e19_c14_u200	Better?
s03_e19_c14_u201	Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.
s03_e19_c14_u202	Ah, Kate?
s03_e19_c14_u203	Yeah?
s03_e19_c14_u204	You ah, you forgot your shoes.
s03_e19_c14_u205	(she giggles) I'm probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles some more)
s03_e19_c14_u206	Hey, listen you ah....
s03_e19_c14_u207	Hmm?
s03_e19_c14_u208	...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
s03_e19_c14_u209	Umm.
s03_e19_c14_u210	(leaning in) Kate?
s03_e19_c14_u211	Yep.
s03_e19_c14_u212	You ready to go?
s03_e19_c14_u213	Yeah.
s03_e19_c14_u214	(to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)
s03_e19_c14_u215	So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
s03_e19_c14_u216	Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
s03_e19_c15_u217	(to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman...
s03_e19_c15_u218	Cause it's-it's not his last name.
s03_e19_c15_u219	It isn't?
s03_e19_c15_u220	No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man.
s03_e19_c15_u221	Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!
s03_e19_c15_u222	(entering) Hey!
s03_e19_c15_u223	Hey, Rach, how was work?
s03_e19_c15_u224	Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
s03_e19_c15_u225	By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
s03_e19_c15_u226	Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)
s03_e19_c15_u227	Something wrong?
s03_e19_c15_u228	(She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)
s03_e19_c16_u229	So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
s03_e19_c16_u230	Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
s03_e19_c16_u231	What about things that are already gold?
s03_e19_c16_u232	Ahh, his work is done.
s03_e19_c16_u233	Okay, let's play my game now.
s03_e19_c16_u234	Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)
s10_e16_c01_u001	All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
s10_e16_c01_u002	Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
s10_e16_c01_u003	Just flip!
s10_e16_c01_u004	Damnit!
s10_e16_c01_u005	Hey!
s10_e16_c01_u006	Hey!
s10_e16_c01_u007	So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
s10_e16_c01_u008	Oh, that sounds good!
s10_e16_c01_u009	Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
s10_e16_c01_u010	It's all done!
s10_e16_c01_u011	Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
s10_e16_c01_u012	I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
s10_e16_c01_u013	Ok, so you've done some good work! (pause) What about your carry-ons?
s10_e16_c01_u014	Oh, well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
s10_e16_c01_u015	Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! (they hug)
s10_e16_c01_u016	Where's your passport?
s10_e16_c01_u017	It should be right next to my plane ticket.
s10_e16_c01_u018	Well, it's not.
s10_e16_c01_u019	What? Maybe I put it in here (she opens her bag). Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
s10_e16_c01_u020	Here, let me help you. (they both start opening boxes)
s10_e16_c01_u021	Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
s10_e16_c02_u022	Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?
s10_e16_c02_u023	I know.
s10_e16_c02_u024	You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
s10_e16_c02_u025	No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
s10_e16_c02_u026	Hey!
s10_e16_c02_u027	Hi.
s10_e16_c02_u028	Hey Erica, welcome back to town! (pause) Wow, look how big you've gotten.
s10_e16_c02_u029	That's because I'm pregnant!
s10_e16_c02_u030	Right, no, I understand.
s10_e16_c02_u031	Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
s10_e16_c02_u032	No, no, I knew (he stares at her breasts).
s10_e16_c02_u033	She brought them up! (pause) I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
s10_e16_c02_u034	Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
s10_e16_c02_u035	Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
s10_e16_c02_u036	Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
s10_e16_c02_u037	Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
s10_e16_c02_u038	Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
s10_e16_c02_u039	Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
s10_e16_c02_u040	Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
s10_e16_c02_u041	Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
s10_e16_c02_u042	Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
s10_e16_c02_u043	No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
s10_e16_c02_u044	Yeah, it takes two incomes.
s10_e16_c02_u045	Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
s10_e16_c02_u046	Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
s10_e16_c02_u047	Mhm, (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
s10_e16_c02_u048	Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
s10_e16_c03_u049	What are you guys doing?
s10_e16_c03_u050	Try it, I can't feel a thing! (Ross starts punching him too)
s10_e16_c03_u051	We're taking a break!
s10_e16_c03_u052	From?
s10_e16_c03_u053	Jumping on the bed?
s10_e16_c03_u054	All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
s10_e16_c03_u055	You got it! (Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
s10_e16_c03_u056	No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
s10_e16_c03_u057	You guys hear a ringing?
s10_e16_c03_u058	(holding a pair of furry handcuffs) What the hell is this?
s10_e16_c03_u059	Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
s10_e16_c03_u060	Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
s10_e16_c03_u061	I didn't know Monica had these!
s10_e16_c03_u062	Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
s10_e16_c03_u063	Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
s10_e16_c03_u064	Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
s10_e16_c04_u065	Hey!
s10_e16_c04_u066	Hey! Where's Mike?
s10_e16_c04_u067	Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.
s10_e16_c04_u068	Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
s10_e16_c04_u069	Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
s10_e16_c04_u070	Rock on!
s10_e16_c04_u071	Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
s10_e16_c04_u072	(entering the room) Hey.
s10_e16_c04_u073	Hey.
s10_e16_c04_u074	Hey, where's Rach?
s10_e16_c04_u075	Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
s10_e16_c04_u076	Great.
s10_e16_c04_u077	Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
s10_e16_c04_u078	Yeah.
s10_e16_c04_u079	Hey Rach, hey you.
s10_e16_c04_u080	Here she is!
s10_e16_c04_u081	What did I just say?
s10_e16_c04_u082	No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
s10_e16_c04_u083	Come here, I'll make you a drink.
s10_e16_c04_u084	Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
s10_e16_c04_u085	I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
s10_e16_c04_u086	Yeah?
s10_e16_c04_u087	Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. (he stops and starts realizing something) Wait a minute...
s10_e16_c04_u088	Yes, Joe?
s10_e16_c04_u089	I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
s10_e16_c04_u090	Well, I've been better.
s10_e16_c04_u091	Uh-hmm.
s10_e16_c04_u092	You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
s10_e16_c04_u093	Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
s10_e16_c04_u094	I'm gonna miss you so much.
s10_e16_c04_u095	I know.
s10_e16_c04_u096	You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).
s10_e16_c04_u097	Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
s10_e16_c04_u098	Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
s10_e16_c05_u099	Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
s10_e16_c05_u100	Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, (she takes something out from her pocket) but I do have something for you.
s10_e16_c05_u101	Oh, oh. (she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?
s10_e16_c05_u102	It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
s10_e16_c05_u103	I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
s10_e16_c06_u104	Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.
s10_e16_c06_u105	Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
s10_e16_c06_u106	What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
s10_e16_c06_u107	Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
s10_e16_c06_u108	That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
s10_e16_c06_u109	Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
s10_e16_c06_u110	Rachel used to live in that room.
s10_e16_c06_u111	Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)
s10_e16_c06_u112	Joey's bare ass!
s10_e16_c06_u113	(he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.
s10_e16_c06_u114	I love you Phoebe.
s10_e16_c06_u115	I love you too. (they hug) Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch! (they hug again)
s10_e16_c06_u116	All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
s10_e16_c06_u117	Ok.
s10_e16_c06_u118	Ok. Monica?
s10_e16_c06_u119	Yeah?
s10_e16_c06_u120	Can you come here with me for a minute?
s10_e16_c06_u121	Sure.
s10_e16_c06_u122	(to Monica) Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
s10_e16_c06_u123	No.
s10_e16_c06_u124	Oh, you're so screwed. (Monica goes into the guest room)
s10_e16_c06_u125	(to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?
s10_e16_c06_u126	She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
s10_e16_c06_u127	Are you kidding? Oh my God...
s10_e16_c06_u128	Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
s10_e16_c06_u129	Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. (pause) Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
s10_e16_c07_u130	Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
s10_e16_c07_u131	I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
s10_e16_c07_u132	(starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
s10_e16_c07_u133	(having the same problem) You're the best friend I ever had.
s10_e16_c07_u134	(says something that cannot be understood)
s10_e16_c07_u135	What?
s10_e16_c07_u136	I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
s10_e16_c07_u137	That is so sweet. (they hug)
s10_e16_c08_u138	(to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
s10_e16_c08_u139	Uh, Rach?
s10_e16_c08_u140	Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
s10_e16_c08_u141	I really made you think about that thing uh?
s10_e16_c08_u142	(to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
s10_e16_c08_u143	(laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
s10_e16_c08_u144	No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
s10_e16_c08_u145	Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
s10_e16_c08_u146	Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
s10_e16_c08_u147	Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
s10_e16_c08_u148	Pheebs!
s10_e16_c08_u149	(from the other side of the room) Yeah!
s10_e16_c08_u150	I think these are yours.
s10_e16_c08_u151	These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
s10_e16_c08_u152	(to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
s10_e16_c08_u153	Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
s10_e16_c08_u154	Where do you think Mike really is? (she giggles, Chandler looks aghast)
s10_e16_c09_u155	Oh honey...
s10_e16_c09_u156	Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
s10_e16_c09_u157	(all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)
s10_e16_c09_u158	Ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
s10_e16_c09_u159	Okay. Oh...
s10_e16_c09_u160	Oh!
s10_e16_c09_u161	I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
s10_e16_c10_u162	(to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?
s10_e16_c10_u163	I don't think so.
s10_e16_c10_u164	Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
s10_e16_c10_u165	You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
s10_e16_c10_u166	That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
s10_e16_c10_u167	God! I can't believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) Why are they taking so long?
s10_e16_c10_u168	I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
s10_e16_c10_u169	No, no, no, no!
s10_e16_c10_u170	Okay, here we go...
s10_e16_c10_u171	Oh... (holding Ross's shoulder) Well...
s10_e16_c10_u172	Yeah...
s10_e16_c10_u173	I think I'm gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)
s10_e16_c10_u174	Huh?
s10_e16_c10_u175	Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
s10_e16_c10_u176	What? I don't get a goodbye?
s10_e16_c10_u177	(still very emotional) Lucky bastard!
s10_e16_c11_u178	Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
s10_e16_c11_u179	Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
s10_e16_c11_u180	Well, it needs to be plicit.
s10_e16_c11_u181	All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
s10_e16_c11_u182	No, I don't think so.
s10_e16_c11_u183	You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
s10_e16_c11_u184	Yeah. Mine too.
s10_e16_c11_u185	Mine was a humdinger
s10_e16_c11_u186	(annoyed) O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? (Joey gives Ross a hug) NOT FROM YOU! (Joey lets go)
s10_e16_c11_u187	Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
s10_e16_c11_u188	And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
s10_e16_c11_u189	THE HELL I DO!
s10_e16_c11_u190	I don't get a goodbye?
s10_e16_c11_u191	What?
s10_e16_c11_u192	(talking agitated and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.
s10_e16_c11_u193	Ross...
s10_e16_c11_u194	Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)
s10_e16_c12_u195	I hope Ross isn't too upset.
s10_e16_c12_u196	I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
s10_e16_c12_u197	Tell me about it.
s10_e16_c12_u198	Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
s10_e16_c12_u199	All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
s10_e16_c12_u200	Uh, where do you think you're going?
s10_e16_c12_u201	I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
s10_e16_c12_u202	We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
s10_e16_c12_u203	Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
s10_e16_c12_u204	Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)
s10_e16_c12_u205	Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
s10_e16_c12_u206	(to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
s10_e16_c12_u207	Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
s10_e16_c12_u208	Yeah.
s10_e16_c12_u209	Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
s10_e16_c12_u210	Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
s10_e16_c12_u211	You did? How?
s10_e16_c12_u212	Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
s10_e16_c12_u213	Oh my God! Let me see. (they all look at the pictures)
s10_e16_c12_u214	Who's that dirty old lady?
s10_e16_c12_u215	Monica's grandmother.
s10_e16_c12_u216	Nana liked it rough!
s10_e16_c12_u217	Hi!
s10_e16_c12_u218	Hey!
s10_e16_c12_u219	Come on here, have a seat.
s10_e16_c12_u220	How was your night?
s10_e16_c12_u221	Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh... (she looks likes she is in pain, holding her belly) Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
s10_e16_c12_u222	Erica, are you okay?
s10_e16_c12_u223	Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
s10_e16_c12_u224	Oh my God!
s10_e16_c12_u225	Relax! We just get her some antacids.
s10_e16_c12_u226	She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.
s10_e16_c12_u227	Oh my God!
s10_e16_c12_u228	Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
s10_e16_c12_u229	All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh! (she's hyperventilating)
s10_e16_c12_u230	Honey, it's gonna be okay.
s10_e16_c12_u231	You can do this. Just breathe.
s10_e16_c12_u232	Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
s10_e16_c12_u233	(in pain) Ooh! Are you sure?
s10_e16_c12_u234	Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.
s10_e16_c12_u235	Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
s10_e16_c12_u236	What?
s10_e16_c12_u237	If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
s10_e16_c13_u238	You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
s10_e16_c13_u239	That's what it seemed like.
s10_e16_c13_u240	I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
s10_e16_c13_u241	Fine, then why didn't you say something?
s10_e16_c13_u242	Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
s10_e16_c13_u243	Rach!
s10_e16_c13_u244	What?
s10_e16_c13_u245	You keep, you keep... You can't...
s10_e16_c13_u246	WHAT?
s10_e16_c14_u247	A little more.
s10_e16_c14_u248	Okay. (she starts to stuff styrofoam peanuts down the front of Joey's pants.)
s10_e16_c14_u249	A little more, a little more. (she stuffs some more down his pants and Joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.) A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.
s10_e16_c14_u250	All right, ready?
s10_e16_c14_u251	Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.
s10_e16_c14_u252	All right, here it goes...
s10_e16_c14_u253	(in pain) Doesn't work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor)
s05_e05_c01_u001	(quietly) Hi!
s05_e05_c01_u002	(quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)
s05_e05_c01_u003	Monica? What time is it?
s05_e05_c01_u004	Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)
s05_e05_c01_u005	But it's dark out.
s05_e05_c01_u006	Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
s05_e05_c01_u007	I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the bathroom.)
s05_e05_c01_u008	I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
s05_e05_c01_u009	I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
s05_e05_c01_u010	All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
s05_e05_c01_u011	Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
s05_e05_c01_u012	Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
s05_e05_c01_u013	Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)
s05_e05_c01_u014	Wait! What about Joey?
s05_e05_c02_u015	(entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
s05_e05_c02_u016	Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
s05_e05_c02_u017	Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
s05_e05_c02_u018	I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
s05_e05_c02_u019	(entering) Hey.
s05_e05_c02_u020	Hey!
s05_e05_c02_u021	Hey.
s05_e05_c02_u022	Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
s05_e05_c02_u023	No, she's out shopping.
s05_e05_c02_u024	Damn!
s05_e05_c02_u025	What's going on?
s05_e05_c02_u026	I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
s05_e05_c02_u027	Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
s05_e05_c02_u028	Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig of Pepto Bismol.)
s05_e05_c02_u029	Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
s05_e05_c02_u030	I have no idea. I mean- But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
s05_e05_c02_u031	Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean
s05_e05_c02_u032	(entering) Hi, guys!
s05_e05_c02_u033	Hi!
s05_e05_c02_u034	Uh, hey!
s05_e05_c02_u035	What's going on?
s05_e05_c02_u036	We're flipping Monica's mattress.
s05_e05_c02_u037	So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
s05_e05_c02_u038	Yeah that's better than my way.
s05_e05_c02_u039	Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
s05_e05_c02_u040	Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)
s05_e05_c02_u041	(going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.
s05_e05_c02_u042	So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
s05_e05_c02_u043	Oh yeah! I know.
s05_e05_c02_u044	(To Chandler) Can you hear anything?
s05_e05_c02_u045	Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
s05_e05_c02_u046	Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
s05_e05_c02_u047	(holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
s05_e05_c02_u048	Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles
s05_e05_c02_u049	Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)
s05_e05_c02_u050	Condoms?
s05_e05_c02_u051	You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
s05_e05_c02_u052	And condoms are the way to do that?
s05_e05_c02_u053	Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily
s05_e05_c02_u054	(interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!
s05_e05_c02_u055	What?!
s05_e05_c02_u056	Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
s05_e05_c02_u057	Le Poo's still alive?!
s05_e05_c02_u058	Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh my God.
s05_e05_c02_u059	Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
s05_e05_c02_u060	It's Le Poo.
s05_e05_c02_u061	I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
s05_e05_c03_u062	(jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!
s05_e05_c03_u063	Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
s05_e05_c03_u064	Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
s05_e05_c03_u065	Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back.
s05_e05_c03_u066	Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
s05_e05_c03_u067	We're switching rooms.
s05_e05_c03_u068	(looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
s05_e05_c03_u069	No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
s05_e05_c03_u070	Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)
s05_e05_c04_u071	Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
s05_e05_c04_u072	Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)
s05_e05_c04_u073	Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing- Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!
s05_e05_c04_u074	What?
s05_e05_c04_u075	You're nose is bleeding!
s05_e05_c04_u076	Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her nose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head back.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
s05_e05_c04_u077	Umm- (Rachel blows her nose.)
s05_e05_c04_u078	Sorry. Sorry.
s05_e05_c04_u079	Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
s05_e05_c04_u080	Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
s05_e05_c05_u081	I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
s05_e05_c05_u082	Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)
s05_e05_c05_u083	(watching the chase) They say he's only got half a tank left.
s05_e05_c05_u084	Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
s05_e05_c05_u085	We're switching rooms again.
s05_e05_c05_u086	What? Why?
s05_e05_c05_u087	This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
s05_e05_c05_u088	Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
s05_e05_c05_u089	(To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
s05_e05_c05_u090	Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
s05_e05_c05_u091	Chandler!
s05_e05_c05_u092	(turning to face her) Yeah.
s05_e05_c05_u093	Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
s05_e05_c05_u094	I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
s05_e05_c05_u095	Okay, this one I like!
s05_e05_c05_u096	(watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
s05_e05_c05_u097	Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
s05_e05_c05_u098	Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
s05_e05_c05_u099	Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
s05_e05_c05_u100	Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
s05_e05_c05_u101	I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
s05_e05_c05_u102	Do not speak ill of the dead.
s05_e05_c05_u103	We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
s05_e05_c05_u104	I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
s05_e05_c05_u105	What did you say?
s05_e05_c05_u106	I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
s05_e05_c06_u107	Hi!
s05_e05_c06_u108	Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
s05_e05_c06_u109	Okay, what's up?
s05_e05_c06_u110	Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
s05_e05_c06_u111	Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
s05_e05_c06_u112	And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants
s05_e05_c06_u113	Yeah?
s05_e05_c06_u114	is for me not to see you anymore.
s05_e05_c06_u115	That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause) (Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
s05_e05_c06_u116	It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
s05_e05_c06_u117	Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
s05_e05_c06_u118	You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
s05_e05_c06_u119	Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
s05_e05_c06_u120	What are you doing?
s05_e05_c06_u121	Storming out!
s05_e05_c06_u122	Rachel, this is your apartment.
s05_e05_c06_u123	Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
s05_e05_c07_u124	Damn Rollos!
s05_e05_c07_u125	Hey, you're back!
s05_e05_c07_u126	Hey.
s05_e05_c07_u127	How was your conference?
s05_e05_c07_u128	It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)
s05_e05_c07_u129	Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
s05_e05_c07_u130	Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
s05_e05_c07_u131	(entering) Hi!
s05_e05_c07_u132	Hey, you're back too!
s05_e05_c07_u133	Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
s05_e05_c07_u134	Hey, how was your chef thing?
s05_e05_c07_u135	Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
s05_e05_c07_u136	Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
s05_e05_c07_u137	Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)
s05_e05_c07_u138	Monica. (Follows her out.)
s05_e05_c07_u139	Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
s05_e05_c07_u140	Okay, fine, $300.
s05_e05_c07_u141	300 dollars?!
s05_e05_c07_u142	Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
s05_e05_c07_u143	Urghh!!
s05_e05_c07_u144	(sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?
s05_e05_c07_u145	Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
s05_e05_c07_u146	Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
s05_e05_c08_u147	You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
s05_e05_c08_u148	You want my advice?
s05_e05_c08_u149	Yes! Please!
s05_e05_c08_u150	You're not gonna like it.
s05_e05_c08_u151	That's okay.
s05_e05_c08_u152	You got married to fast.
s05_e05_c08_u153	That's not advice!
s05_e05_c08_u154	I told ya.
s05_e05_c08_u155	I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)
s05_e05_c08_u156	Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
s05_e05_c08_u157	Maybe I could do it.
s05_e05_c08_u158	(entering) Hi!
s05_e05_c08_u159	Hi, Rach.
s05_e05_c08_u160	Hi!
s05_e05_c08_u161	Hey.
s05_e05_c08_u162	Hey.
s05_e05_c08_u163	Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
s05_e05_c08_u164	I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. (Points over his shoulder.)
s05_e05_c08_u165	That's not Ross!
s05_e05_c08_u166	Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
s05_e05_c08_u167	Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
s05_e05_c08_u168	Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
s05_e05_c08_u169	Hey, you're not Kip!
s05_e05_c08_u170	(To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?
s05_e05_c08_u171	Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?
s05_e05_c08_u172	Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
s05_e05_c08_u173	Oh, that poor bastard.
s05_e05_c08_u174	See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
s05_e05_c08_u175	You're not gonna be phased out!
s05_e05_c08_u176	Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. (To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
s05_e05_c08_u177	Ehh!!
s05_e05_c08_u178	Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
s05_e05_c09_u179	(entering) Hey!
s05_e05_c09_u180	Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
s05_e05_c09_u181	Yes that was mine.
s05_e05_c09_u182	'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
s05_e05_c09_u183	Yes that would have made more sense.
s05_e05_c09_u184	Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
s05_e05_c10_u185	Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!
s05_e05_c10_u186	Come where?
s05_e05_c10_u187	Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
s05_e05_c10_u188	Okay, but try and get Joey too.
s05_e05_c10_u189	(entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
s05_e05_c10_u190	Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his back.) Forever.
s05_e05_c10_u191	Hi.
s05_e05_c10_u192	Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
s05_e05_c10_u193	I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
s05_e05_c10_u194	Oh, Ross
s05_e05_c10_u195	No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
s05_e05_c10_u196	No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
s05_e05_c10_u197	Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
s05_e05_c10_u198	Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
s05_e05_c10_u199	I can't believe this is happening.
s05_e05_c10_u200	I know.
s05_e05_c10_u201	I am so sorry.
s05_e05_c10_u202	I know that too.
s05_e05_c10_u203	(entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
s05_e05_c11_u204	(entering) Hey!
s05_e05_c11_u205	Hi.
s05_e05_c11_u206	I just came over to drop off-nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
s05_e05_c11_u207	Yeah, it did.
s05_e05_c11_u208	So, I guess this is over.
s05_e05_c11_u209	What?
s05_e05_c11_u210	Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
s05_e05_c11_u211	Why, exactly?
s05_e05_c11_u212	Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
s05_e05_c11_u213	Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh! (They both realize something there.)
s05_e05_c11_u214	So, this isn't over?
s05_e05_c11_u215	(laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
s05_e05_c11_u216	Really? Okay. Great!
s05_e05_c11_u217	Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)
s05_e05_c11_u218	(stops her) We're in a relationship?
s05_e05_c11_u219	I'm afraid so.
s05_e05_c11_u220	Okay.
s05_e05_c12_u221	Hey!
s05_e05_c12_u222	Hey!
s05_e05_c12_u223	Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
s05_e05_c12_u224	Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
s05_e05_c12_u225	Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
s05_e05_c12_u226	Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)
s05_e05_c12_u227	(shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
s05_e05_c12_u228	Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)
s05_e05_c12_u229	Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
s05_e05_c12_u230	Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
s05_e05_c12_u231	Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
s05_e05_c12_u232	(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
s05_e05_c12_u233	Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
s05_e05_c12_u234	How?! When?!
s05_e05_c12_u235	It happened in London.
s05_e05_c12_u236	IN LONDON!!!
s05_e05_c12_u237	The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
s05_e05_c12_u238	But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
s05_e05_c12_u239	No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
s05_e05_c12_u240	Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
s05_e05_c12_u241	All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but
s05_e05_c12_u242	I know, it's great!
s05_e05_c12_u243	Aww, I don't want to see that!
s05_e05_c12_u244	We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
s05_e05_c13_u245	The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
s05_e05_c13_u246	Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
s05_e05_c13_u247	Count for what?
s05_e05_c13_u248	Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
s05_e05_c13_u249	I guess I'm done.
s05_e05_c13_u250	Fun's over!
s05_e05_c13_u251	Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
s05_e05_c13_u252	Uh-huh!
s05_e05_c13_u253	I think I'm gonna take-off.
s05_e05_c13_u254	Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)
s07_e09_c01_u001	(on the bike) I'm ready!
s07_e09_c01_u002	You sure?
s07_e09_c01_u003	Uh-huh!
s07_e09_c01_u004	Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)
s07_e09_c01_u005	(To Chandler) Thanks daddy.
s07_e09_c01_u006	No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours. (Ross pushes him off.)
s07_e09_c01_u007	Okay. Okay.
s07_e09_c01_u008	Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
s07_e09_c01_u009	His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
s07_e09_c01_u010	Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and-it bent.
s07_e09_c01_u011	Yeah.
s07_e09_c01_u012	I never had a bike of my own.
s07_e09_c01_u013	(shocked) What?!
s07_e09_c01_u014	Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
s07_e09_c01_u015	That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.
s07_e09_c01_u016	Ohh.
s07_e09_c01_u017	Did the girl ever let you ride it?
s07_e09_c01_u018	No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. (They're all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
s07_e09_c01_u019	That is so unfair!
s07_e09_c01_u020	Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod, "Oh.")
s07_e09_c02_u021	Hey! What are you guys doing?
s07_e09_c02_u022	Hey.
s07_e09_c02_u023	Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
s07_e09_c02_u024	I'm sorry, who?
s07_e09_c02_u025	I'm gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table) on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
s07_e09_c02_u026	But we don't know the neighbors.
s07_e09_c02_u027	I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
s07_e09_c02_u028	See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
s07_e09_c02_u029	Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
s07_e09_c02_u030	(entering, happily) Gooood morning!!
s07_e09_c02_u031	Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
s07_e09_c02_u032	Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
s07_e09_c02_u033	Where you can make out with your assistant.
s07_e09_c02_u034	Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
s07_e09_c02_u035	Oh yeah, what's the plan?
s07_e09_c02_u036	(pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We- We are not- -going to let it- be a problem.
s07_e09_c02_u037	Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
s07_e09_c02_u038	Well y'know, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to giggle.)
s07_e09_c02_u039	Did you two
s07_e09_c02_u040	Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
s07_e09_c02_u041	Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire
s07_e09_c02_u042	Anymore!!
s07_e09_c02_u043	Okay.
s07_e09_c03_u044	Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
s07_e09_c03_u045	Yes, at 4:00.
s07_e09_c03_u046	Okay, thank you. That'll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag starts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (They kiss.)
s07_e09_c03_u047	I'd better get back to my desk.
s07_e09_c03_u048	Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
s07_e09_c03_u049	My what?
s07_e09_c03_u050	Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)
s07_e09_c03_u051	Are you serious?
s07_e09_c03_u052	No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
s07_e09_c04_u053	The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
s07_e09_c04_u054	Well, either that or uh-(Motions towards Joey's door.)
s07_e09_c04_u055	Joey!!
s07_e09_c04_u056	Yeah?
s07_e09_c04_u057	Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
s07_e09_c04_u058	Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
s07_e09_c04_u059	Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
s07_e09_c04_u060	They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!! (Starts to do so.)
s07_e09_c04_u061	Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
s07_e09_c04_u062	Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
s07_e09_c04_u063	Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! (Monica runs to make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
s07_e09_c04_u064	Sure!
s07_e09_c04_u065	Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so
s07_e09_c04_u066	(gasps) Oh my God Ross!!
s07_e09_c04_u067	You like it?
s07_e09_c04_u068	I love it!!
s07_e09_c04_u069	Yeah?
s07_e09_c04_u070	Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
s07_e09_c04_u071	Ahh.
s07_e09_c04_u072	Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
s07_e09_c04_u073	Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
s07_e09_c04_u074	Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
s07_e09_c04_u075	(stunned at the complement) You're welcome.
s07_e09_c04_u076	(starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
s07_e09_c04_u077	(about to cry) Am not!
s07_e09_c05_u078	(turning a light on) Who is that?!
s07_e09_c05_u079	Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I-I am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?
s07_e09_c05_u080	Hi!
s07_e09_c05_u081	Hi. Do you know what time it is?
s07_e09_c05_u082	It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
s07_e09_c05_u083	Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
s07_e09_c05_u084	(laughs) 4:00 A.M.
s07_e09_c05_u085	So, can I get some candy?
s07_e09_c05_u086	I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
s07_e09_c05_u087	Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
s07_e09_c05_u088	Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
s07_e09_c05_u089	Um-hmm.
s07_e09_c05_u090	(looking at Monica.) Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
s07_e09_c05_u091	Mm! Night Gar'! (Monica closes the door.)
s07_e09_c06_u092	(hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
s07_e09_c06_u093	No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
s07_e09_c06_u094	(worried) Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
s07_e09_c06_u095	A joke they would appreciate?
s07_e09_c06_u096	I'm thinkin' no.
s07_e09_c06_u097	What did you say?!
s07_e09_c06_u098	Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
s07_e09_c06_u099	No, not my touchie.
s07_e09_c06_u100	Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
s07_e09_c07_u101	Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
s07_e09_c07_u102	Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
s07_e09_c07_u103	Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
s07_e09_c07_u104	(about to cry) Those two only had each other!
s07_e09_c07_u105	Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
s07_e09_c07_u106	Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
s07_e09_c07_u107	Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
s07_e09_c07_u108	Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
s07_e09_c07_u109	Hey Pheebs?
s07_e09_c07_u110	Oh hi!
s07_e09_c07_u111	Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
s07_e09_c07_u112	Ohh, uh-huh so much!
s07_e09_c07_u113	Pheebs you uh-you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
s07_e09_c07_u114	Of course!
s07_e09_c07_u115	Umm, can we see you ride it?
s07_e09_c07_u116	Okay. (The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?
s07_e09_c08_u117	See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
s07_e09_c08_u118	(with his mouth full) What happened? I'm just eating candy.
s07_e09_c08_u119	Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
s07_e09_c08_u120	Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
s07_e09_c08_u121	Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
s07_e09_c08_u122	Hey Rach?
s07_e09_c08_u123	Yeah?
s07_e09_c08_u124	That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? (He shows her what he's been drawing.)
s07_e09_c08_u125	Oh my God! Joey!
s07_e09_c08_u126	What is the matter with you?
s07_e09_c08_u127	Ugh!
s07_e09_c08_u128	Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
s07_e09_c08_u129	Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
s07_e09_c08_u130	I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? (Points to her new sign.) Rules are rules.
s07_e09_c08_u131	Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
s07_e09_c08_u132	No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell em?
s07_e09_c08_u133	I told em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
s07_e09_c08_u134	Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
s07_e09_c08_u135	Please, can't you help me out?
s07_e09_c08_u136	(watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
s07_e09_c08_u137	Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
s07_e09_c08_u138	(still talking to the woman) All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
s07_e09_c08_u139	(exasperatedly) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
s07_e09_c08_u140	(after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you.
s07_e09_c08_u141	(closing the door) It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
s07_e09_c08_u142	Y'know what would work?
s07_e09_c08_u143	Hmm?
s07_e09_c08_u144	Stop making candy!
s07_e09_c08_u145	But they like it!
s07_e09_c08_u146	You mean they like you.
s07_e09_c08_u147	Maybe.
s07_e09_c08_u148	Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
s07_e09_c08_u149	Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)
s07_e09_c09_u150	Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready-Set
s07_e09_c09_u151	(hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
s07_e09_c09_u152	Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
s07_e09_c09_u153	Why? Why do I have to learn?
s07_e09_c09_u154	Well-In-in case of emergency.
s07_e09_c09_u155	What kind of an emergency?
s07_e09_c09_u156	Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh-I'll shoot you."
s07_e09_c09_u157	Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
s07_e09_c09_u158	Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
s07_e09_c09_u159	You won't let go?
s07_e09_c09_u160	No!
s07_e09_c09_u161	Swear?!
s07_e09_c09_u162	I swear!
s07_e09_c09_u163	(thinks it over) Okay.
s07_e09_c09_u164	Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They start.)
s07_e09_c09_u165	All right.
s07_e09_c09_u166	All right. Feel good?
s07_e09_c09_u167	Well
s07_e09_c09_u168	All right, try pedaling.
s07_e09_c09_u169	Okay. (Does so.)
s07_e09_c09_u170	That's it, your doing great.
s07_e09_c09_u171	Okay.
s07_e09_c09_u172	Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
s07_e09_c09_u173	Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
s07_e09_c09_u174	Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)
s07_e09_c09_u175	Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
s07_e09_c09_u176	I-I just thought you were doing so well. I
s07_e09_c09_u177	I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.)
s07_e09_c09_u178	It's a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!
s07_e09_c10_u179	Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
s07_e09_c10_u180	Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
s07_e09_c10_u181	Need some help?
s07_e09_c10_u182	No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
s07_e09_c10_u183	By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe's room.)
s07_e09_c10_u184	(seeing him) Oh, hello liar.
s07_e09_c10_u185	(entering) Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
s07_e09_c10_u186	I could've been killed I hope you know!
s07_e09_c10_u187	I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
s07_e09_c10_u188	Well, I would love to but-the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.)
s07_e09_c10_u189	Phoebe.
s07_e09_c10_u190	What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
s07_e09_c10_u191	All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
s07_e09_c10_u192	What?! Why?!
s07_e09_c10_u193	Because! Because, it-it-it's- It'd be like you having this guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.
s07_e09_c10_u194	All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
s07_e09_c10_u195	Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You're making the bike very happy.
s07_e09_c10_u196	(sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike) Please don't die!
s07_e09_c11_u197	Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
s07_e09_c11_u198	That's kinda sad.
s07_e09_c11_u199	Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
s07_e09_c11_u200	Got it!
s07_e09_c11_u201	Let's roll!
s07_e09_c11_u202	Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
s07_e09_c11_u203	(worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to usher Tag out.)
s07_e09_c11_u204	Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
s07_e09_c11_u205	Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? (Holds up the box.)
s07_e09_c11_u206	Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. (Rachel glances at Tag to say, "See?") So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
s07_e09_c11_u207	(laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting serious) what would happen exactly.
s07_e09_c11_u208	Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
s07_e09_c11_u209	Well
s07_e09_c11_u210	(interrupting) Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
s07_e09_c11_u211	Oh no-no-no
s07_e09_c11_u212	(interrupting again) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
s07_e09_c11_u213	You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
s07_e09_c11_u214	(pause) Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
s07_e09_c11_u215	It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
s07_e09_c11_u216	You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? (Grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn't matter.
s07_e09_c11_u217	Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? (They both nod no.) No? Okay, well uh, you've (Grabs the chocolates.) got my fax number. (Exits.)
s07_e09_c11_u218	Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
s07_e09_c11_u219	No, don't worry about it.
s07_e09_c11_u220	No, you could've lost your job.
s07_e09_c11_u221	Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
s07_e09_c11_u222	Thank you! You're great! (They kiss.)
s07_e09_c11_u223	Y'know what?
s07_e09_c11_u224	What?
s07_e09_c11_u225	I feel great. (Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps its contents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.) What?
s07_e09_c11_u226	I- It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
s07_e09_c11_u227	Oh, I'm sorry. (He bends over to pick the stuff up.)
s07_e09_c11_u228	(looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
s07_e09_c12_u229	(asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?
s07_e09_c12_u230	We're waiting for the candy. (Yelling at the door.) Bring out the candy!
s07_e09_c12_u231	Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
s07_e09_c12_u232	Joey!
s07_e09_c12_u233	What's up buddy?
s07_e09_c12_u234	What are you doing?
s07_e09_c12_u235	Waiting for candy.
s07_e09_c12_u236	Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.
s07_e09_c12_u237	(opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
s07_e09_c12_u238	All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
s07_e09_c12_u239	(from earlier) Candy Lady?
s07_e09_c12_u240	No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
s07_e09_c12_u241	(stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
s07_e09_c12_u242	All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
s07_e09_c12_u243	That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to the candy and starts eating it.)
s07_e09_c12_u244	(To Chandler) Thank you.
s07_e09_c12_u245	You're welcome. (They kiss.)
s07_e09_c12_u246	Did you smoke?
s07_e09_c12_u247	No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
s07_e09_c12_u248	I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
s07_e09_c12_u249	(with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know- (Grabs the note.)
s07_e09_c13_u250	I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
s07_e09_c13_u251	Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
s07_e09_c13_u252	Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special. (She rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly attached.)
s03_e04_c01_u001	Oh, oh! It's on again!
s03_e04_c01_u002	You guys, can we please not watch this all right.
s03_e04_c01_u003	Shhhh!
s03_e04_c01_u004	(on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!
s03_e04_c01_u005	And there is Kevin.
s03_e04_c01_u006	Can we please turn this off?
s03_e04_c01_u007	Noo way, Kevin.
s03_e04_c01_u008	(to Chandler) Are you intrigued?
s03_e04_c01_u009	You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
s03_e04_c01_u010	(on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.
s03_e04_c02_u011	Well, it's official there are no good movies.
s03_e04_c02_u012	Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and lean back into Monica.)
s03_e04_c02_u013	Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.
s03_e04_c02_u014	(entering) Hey!
s03_e04_c02_u015	Hey.
s03_e04_c02_u016	Hey, man. What's up?
s03_e04_c02_u017	Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
s03_e04_c02_u018	Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
s03_e04_c02_u019	Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it was me!
s03_e04_c02_u020	How is it you?
s03_e04_c02_u021	Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows him her hand)
s03_e04_c02_u022	Yep, that's my audition.
s03_e04_c02_u023	See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
s03_e04_c02_u024	Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
s03_e04_c02_u025	What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
s03_e04_c02_u026	Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
s03_e04_c02_u027	That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
s03_e04_c02_u028	Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
s03_e04_c02_u029	What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing).
s03_e04_c02_u030	What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
s03_e04_c02_u031	No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice) 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
s03_e04_c02_u032	Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)
s03_e04_c02_u033	(on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
s03_e04_c02_u034	Is anybody else scared?
s03_e04_c02_u035	(on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)
s03_e04_c02_u036	Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
s03_e04_c02_u037	Oh, now you want a pad.
s03_e04_c03_u038	There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding a Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
s03_e04_c03_u039	He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
s03_e04_c03_u040	He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
s03_e04_c03_u041	Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
s03_e04_c03_u042	So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
s03_e04_c03_u043	This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
s03_e04_c03_u044	You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
s03_e04_c03_u045	Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)
s03_e04_c03_u046	Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll? (uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)
s03_e04_c03_u047	(entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
s03_e04_c03_u048	I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)
s03_e04_c03_u049	There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
s03_e04_c03_u050	I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
s03_e04_c03_u051	(entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
s03_e04_c03_u052	Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
s03_e04_c03_u053	Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
s03_e04_c03_u054	What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
s03_e04_c03_u055	Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
s03_e04_c03_u056	And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
s03_e04_c03_u057	Noo.
s03_e04_c03_u058	You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
s03_e04_c03_u059	No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
s03_e04_c03_u060	Men are unbelievable.
s03_e04_c03_u061	What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
s03_e04_c03_u062	I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
s03_e04_c03_u063	Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
s03_e04_c03_u064	Hey, you know about that?!
s03_e04_c03_u065	Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
s03_e04_c03_u066	(to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.
s03_e04_c03_u067	Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?
s03_e04_c03_u068	Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
s03_e04_c03_u069	Amazingly, that makes sense.
s03_e04_c03_u070	You think?
s03_e04_c03_u071	Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
s03_e04_c03_u072	Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
s03_e04_c04_u073	Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
s03_e04_c04_u074	Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
s03_e04_c04_u075	Come on baby, come on!
s03_e04_c04_u076	(on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
s03_e04_c04_u077	Very nice touch.
s03_e04_c04_u078	(in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hi Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through a tunnel.
s03_e04_c04_u079	Unbelievable.
s03_e04_c04_u080	Thank you so much.
s03_e04_c04_u081	It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
s03_e04_c04_u082	You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
s03_e04_c04_u083	Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
s03_e04_c04_u084	Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
s03_e04_c04_u085	Two?
s03_e04_c04_u086	Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
s03_e04_c04_u087	Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right
s03_e04_c04_u088	Nooo, four.
s03_e04_c05_u089	So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
s03_e04_c05_u090	'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)
s03_e04_c05_u091	Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.
s03_e04_c05_u092	Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
s03_e04_c05_u093	Oh, you didn't have to do this.
s03_e04_c05_u094	Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
s03_e04_c05_u095	Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.
s03_e04_c05_u096	Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
s03_e04_c05_u097	We should?
s03_e04_c05_u098	Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
s03_e04_c05_u099	(laughs) I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?
s03_e04_c05_u100	I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
s03_e04_c05_u101	You probably want us to move in together?
s03_e04_c05_u102	It doesn't scare me!
s03_e04_c05_u103	Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...(starts to leave)
s03_e04_c05_u104	Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)
s03_e04_c06_u105	Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)
s03_e04_c06_u106	So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
s03_e04_c06_u107	That is never good.
s03_e04_c06_u108	Then I got all needy and clingy.
s03_e04_c06_u109	Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
s03_e04_c06_u110	She said she'd call me.
s03_e04_c06_u111	Oh God.
s03_e04_c06_u112	Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
s03_e04_c06_u113	This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
s03_e04_c06_u114	Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
s03_e04_c06_u115	You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
s03_e04_c06_u116	Yeah, you do.
s03_e04_c06_u117	So, you don't think I'm terminal?
s03_e04_c06_u118	Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
s03_e04_c06_u119	Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
s03_e04_c06_u120	This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
s03_e04_c06_u121	She has to know that your not ready.
s03_e04_c06_u122	Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
s03_e04_c06_u123	So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
s03_e04_c06_u124	Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.
s03_e04_c06_u125	I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
s03_e04_c06_u126	Oh.
s03_e04_c07_u127	Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.
s03_e04_c07_u128	G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
s03_e04_c07_u129	(entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
s03_e04_c07_u130	Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
s03_e04_c07_u131	(entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)
s03_e04_c07_u132	Pheebs! There you are!
s03_e04_c07_u133	No it's not, sorry.
s03_e04_c07_u134	But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)
s03_e04_c07_u135	Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
s03_e04_c07_u136	Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
s03_e04_c07_u137	Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
s03_e04_c07_u138	It's okay, these things happen.
s03_e04_c07_u139	But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
s03_e04_c07_u140	I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)
s03_e04_c07_u141	Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
s03_e04_c07_u142	No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
s03_e04_c07_u143	Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
s03_e04_c07_u144	They actually said that?
s03_e04_c07_u145	Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
s03_e04_c07_u146	No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (in a very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent.
s03_e04_c07_u147	Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
s03_e04_c07_u148	(running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (he then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler's door, dead.)
s03_e04_c08_u149	(to butcher) No, thank you. (Chandler makes a sound and she notices him) Chandler!
s03_e04_c08_u150	(in a British accent) Hello, Janice.
s03_e04_c08_u151	What are you doing here?
s03_e04_c08_u152	(in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
s03_e04_c08_u153	Are you being British?!
s03_e04_c08_u154	(normal voice) No. Not anymore.
s03_e04_c08_u155	Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
s03_e04_c08_u156	Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)
s03_e04_c08_u157	Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
s03_e04_c08_u158	Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
s03_e04_c08_u159	Where is this party?
s03_e04_c08_u160	Here in Chelsea.
s03_e04_c08_u161	Who's party is it?
s03_e04_c08_u162	A woman's
s03_e04_c08_u163	What woman?!
s03_e04_c08_u164	(shyly) Chelsea.
s03_e04_c08_u165	Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be? (another guy walks by)
s03_e04_c08_u166	Can I be that guy?
s03_e04_c09_u167	Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
s03_e04_c09_u168	Okay, shoot.
s03_e04_c09_u169	Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
s03_e04_c09_u170	I didn't get it?
s03_e04_c09_u171	No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
s03_e04_c09_u172	Okay, what else?
s03_e04_c09_u173	Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
s03_e04_c09_u174	Oh.
s03_e04_c09_u175	Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
s03_e04_c09_u176	Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
s03_e04_c09_u177	Oh.
s03_e04_c09_u178	Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
s03_e04_c09_u179	Yeah, no, I understand.
s03_e04_c09_u180	You do, thanks.
s03_e04_c09_u181	Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)
s03_e04_c09_u182	Wait a minute.
s03_e04_c09_u183	What?
s03_e04_c09_u184	Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
s03_e04_c09_u185	(in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.
s03_e04_c09_u186	(in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
s03_e04_c10_u187	....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
s03_e04_c10_u188	My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
s03_e04_c10_u189	I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
s03_e04_c10_u190	Yeah, it is.
s03_e04_c10_u191	You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
s03_e04_c10_u192	(answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?
s03_e04_c10_u193	Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
s03_e04_c10_u194	If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
s03_e04_c10_u195	Yeah.
s03_e04_c10_u196	Hello!
s03_e04_c10_u197	Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
s03_e04_c10_u198	Yes, and grumpy.
s03_e04_c10_u199	What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!
s03_e04_c10_u200	He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
s03_e04_c10_u201	(on phone) I love you too.
s03_e04_c10_u202	Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)
s03_e04_c11_u203	G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
s03_e04_c11_u204	Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
s03_e04_c11_u205	What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
s03_e04_c11_u206	Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
s03_e04_c11_u207	What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
s03_e04_c11_u208	What?
s03_e04_c11_u209	Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
s03_e04_c11_u210	What are you talking about?
s03_e04_c11_u211	The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
s03_e04_c11_u212	Okay, you are totally making this up.
s03_e04_c11_u213	How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
s03_e04_c11_u214	(remembering) Oh God.
s03_e04_c11_u215	I've literally never been this happy.
s03_e04_c11_u216	Wasn't there a little song?
s03_e04_c11_u217	Oh please God, let there be a song.
s03_e04_c11_u218	There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!
s03_e04_c11_u219	(singing) 'I am Bea.'
s03_e04_c11_u220	Okay.
s03_e04_c11_u221	'I drink tea.'
s03_e04_c11_u222	Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)
s03_e04_c11_u223	'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
s03_e04_c11_u224	(coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me.
s03_e04_c11_u225	A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the bathroom)
s04_e21_c01_u001	Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
s04_e21_c01_u002	I know. Ross is getting married.
s04_e21_c01_u003	Phoebe is, making people.
s04_e21_c01_u004	Everybody's doing stuff!
s04_e21_c01_u005	And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
s04_e21_c01_u006	(snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!
s04_e21_c01_u007	No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
s04_e21_c01_u008	No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
s04_e21_c01_u009	Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
s04_e21_c01_u010	Yeah!
s04_e21_c01_u011	We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
s04_e21_c01_u012	(entering) Hey!
s04_e21_c01_u013	Hey!
s04_e21_c01_u014	What-what's up?
s04_e21_c01_u015	We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
s04_e21_c01_u016	Yeah baby!
s04_e21_c01_u017	Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
s04_e21_c01_u018	(dejected) Yeah, well
s04_e21_c01_u019	We could get that Everest video though.
s04_e21_c01_u020	Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
s04_e21_c01_u021	And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! (Chandler's excited.) Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
s04_e21_c01_u022	(dejected) Oh, well
s04_e21_c01_u023	So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
s04_e21_c01_u024	Yeeeeahhhh.
s04_e21_c01_u025	Yeah. Yeah.
s04_e21_c01_u026	But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
s04_e21_c01_u027	Yeah we are!
s04_e21_c02_u028	So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
s04_e21_c02_u029	Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her some envelopes.)
s04_e21_c02_u030	Yeah, they're fine.
s04_e21_c02_u031	Yeah?
s04_e21_c02_u032	If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. (Looking through the envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
s04_e21_c02_u033	Sure. Why not?
s04_e21_c02_u034	Really?
s04_e21_c02_u035	Yeah?
s04_e21_c02_u036	I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
s04_e21_c02_u037	Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
s04_e21_c02_u038	Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. (Gets up.) More tea?
s04_e21_c02_u039	Yeah sure.
s04_e21_c02_u040	Earl Grey?
s04_e21_c02_u041	Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
s04_e21_c03_u042	I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
s04_e21_c03_u043	And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
s04_e21_c03_u044	Rachel?!
s04_e21_c03_u045	Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
s04_e21_c03_u046	Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (To Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
s04_e21_c03_u047	Hi, sure!
s04_e21_c03_u048	Hi.
s04_e21_c04_u049	You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
s04_e21_c04_u050	I knew.
s04_e21_c04_u051	You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
s04_e21_c04_u052	I did.
s04_e21_c04_u053	Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
s04_e21_c04_u054	Yeah, maybe...
s04_e21_c04_u055	Okay... okay, maybe I will...
s04_e21_c05_u056	See, I see.... big passion in your future.
s04_e21_c05_u057	Really?
s04_e21_c05_u058	I do.
s04_e21_c05_u059	Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
s04_e21_c05_u060	It's never gonna happen.
s04_e21_c06_u061	Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
s04_e21_c06_u062	Okay.
s04_e21_c06_u063	Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
s04_e21_c06_u064	Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]
s04_e21_c06_u065	Yes, yes, that's right...
s04_e21_c06_u066	Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross] Look at it!
s04_e21_c06_u067	What? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] Ow!
s04_e21_c06_u068	[singing] I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
s04_e21_c07_u069	All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
s04_e21_c07_u070	You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
s04_e21_c07_u071	I could not have done this without you.
s04_e21_c07_u072	Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
s04_e21_c08_u073	You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
s04_e21_c08_u074	(hurt) What?
s04_e21_c08_u075	I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
s04_e21_c08_u076	Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
s04_e21_c08_u077	The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
s04_e21_c08_u078	Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
s04_e21_c08_u079	Fine.
s04_e21_c08_u080	'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
s04_e21_c08_u081	Good.
s04_e21_c08_u082	Good. (Ross leaves)
s04_e21_c09_u083	Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
s04_e21_c09_u084	No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
s04_e21_c09_u085	Well neither do I!
s04_e21_c09_u086	Is this about Mark?
s04_e21_c09_u087	(shocked) Oh my God.
s04_e21_c09_u088	Okay, it's not, it's not.
s04_e21_c09_u089	Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
s04_e21_c09_u090	Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
s04_e21_c09_u091	I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
s04_e21_c09_u092	Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, (goes to the door) let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)
s04_e21_c09_u093	No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
s04_e21_c10_u094	Do I know why we're rushing?
s04_e21_c10_u095	Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He's frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
s04_e21_c10_u096	That's so great for you guys!
s04_e21_c10_u097	Yeah!
s04_e21_c10_u098	Good luck, with your girlfriend.
s04_e21_c10_u099	Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!
s04_e21_c10_u100	Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
s04_e21_c10_u101	Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
s04_e21_c10_u102	So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
s04_e21_c10_u103	Yes, you can, very much.
s04_e21_c10_u104	(seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
s04_e21_c11_u105	(opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
s04_e21_c11_u106	No!!
s04_e21_c11_u107	Just get out! Now!!
s04_e21_c11_u108	No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
s04_e21_c11_u109	Okay! All right! How was she?
s04_e21_c11_u110	Uh-oh.
s04_e21_c11_u111	What?
s04_e21_c11_u112	Was she good?
s04_e21_c11_u113	Don't answer that.
s04_e21_c11_u114	Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
s04_e21_c11_u115	She was...
s04_e21_c11_u116	Awful! Horrible!
s04_e21_c11_u117	She was not good. Not good.
s04_e21_c11_u118	She was nothing compared to you.
s04_e21_c11_u119	She, she was different.
s04_e21_c11_u120	Ewwwww!
s04_e21_c11_u121	Uh-oh.
s04_e21_c11_u122	Good different?
s04_e21_c11_u123	Nobody likes change.
s04_e21_c11_u124	What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
s04_e21_c12_u125	...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater. Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
s04_e21_c12_u126	WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
s04_e21_c14_u127	You seem to really like her.
s04_e21_c14_u128	Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
s04_e21_c14_u129	Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
s04_e21_c14_u130	You think?
s04_e21_c14_u131	Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
s04_e21_c14_u132	Hey, you're right.
s04_e21_c14_u133	Yeah.
s04_e21_c15_u134	Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
s04_e21_c15_u135	(taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
s04_e21_c15_u136	Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
s04_e21_c15_u137	(entering) Hello!
s04_e21_c15_u138	Hey!
s04_e21_c15_u139	Hey!
s04_e21_c15_u140	Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
s04_e21_c15_u141	(sarcastic) Noo.
s04_e21_c15_u142	Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
s04_e21_c15_u143	I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
s04_e21_c15_u144	I didn't know that.
s04_e21_c15_u145	I never knew that either.
s04_e21_c15_u146	I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
s04_e21_c15_u147	(entering) Hey guys! What's up?
s04_e21_c15_u148	Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)
s04_e21_c15_u149	We're hanging out.
s04_e21_c15_u150	What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
s04_e21_c15_u151	See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
s04_e21_c15_u152	Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
s04_e21_c15_u153	I'm sorry honey.
s04_e21_c15_u154	Yeah.
s04_e21_c15_u155	Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
s04_e21_c15_u156	Oh, honey, I don't know. I
s04_e21_c15_u157	This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket
s04_e21_c15_u158	You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
s04_e21_c15_u159	No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
s04_e21_c16_u160	Who's this from?
s04_e21_c16_u161	Oh, that's Ross's.
s04_e21_c16_u162	Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
s04_e21_c16_u163	Remembered what?
s04_e21_c16_u164	It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
s04_e21_c16_u165	Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
s04_e21_c16_u166	I can't believe he did this.
s04_e21_c16_u167	Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
s04_e21_c16_u168	What did you just say?
s04_e21_c16_u169	(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
s04_e21_c16_u170	Oh.... my God.
s04_e21_c17_u171	(seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.
s04_e21_c18_u172	But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
s04_e21_c18_u173	Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
s04_e21_c19_u174	Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up either.
s04_e21_c19_u175	She didn't hang up either...
s04_e21_c19_u176	Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-(Rachel grabs the phone and hangs it up for him.)
s04_e21_c20_u177	(on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (She hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)
s04_e21_c21_u178	Rach, I got a message from you.
s04_e21_c21_u179	Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . (She jumps the couch and lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.)
s04_e21_c21_u180	You're over me?
s04_e21_c21_u181	Ohhhhhhhh God. (climbs off his back)
s04_e21_c21_u182	Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
s04_e21_c21_u183	Ohh, ohh.
s04_e21_c21_u184	When, when were you... under me?
s04_e21_c21_u185	Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
s04_e21_c21_u186	OK, I need to lie down.
s04_e21_c22_u187	He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
s04_e21_c22_u188	Really?
s04_e21_c22_u189	Really. It's always been you, Rach.
s04_e21_c22_u190	Oh, god.
s04_e21_c23_u191	I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
s04_e21_c23_u192	Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
s04_e21_c23_u193	Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
s04_e21_c23_u194	What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
s04_e21_c24_u195	Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
s04_e21_c24_u196	I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
s04_e21_c25_u197	Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
s04_e21_c25_u198	Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
s04_e21_c25_u199	You still love me?
s04_e21_c25_u200	Noo.
s04_e21_c25_u201	What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
s04_e21_c25_u202	Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
s04_e21_c25_u203	What?!
s04_e21_c25_u204	I just, I feel, I-I just...
s04_e21_c26_u205	Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
s04_e21_c26_u206	(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)
s04_e21_c26_u207	And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
s04_e21_c26_u208	I KNEW IT!!!!
s04_e21_c28_u209	You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
s04_e21_c28_u210	Oh.
s04_e21_c28_u211	You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
s04_e21_c28_u212	Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
s04_e21_c28_u213	Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
s04_e21_c28_u214	Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
s04_e21_c28_u215	OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
s04_e21_c28_u216	(to Ross) I can't believe you did that.
s04_e21_c28_u217	Yeah, well.
s04_e21_c28_u218	See, he's her lobster.
s04_e21_c28_u219	(seeing the decision) Nooooo. You're really not going?
s04_e21_c28_u220	Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's- Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
s04_e21_c28_u221	You don't have a car. And your license expired.
s04_e21_c28_u222	I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
s04_e21_c29_u223	All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) "It's almost as good as being there."
s04_e21_c29_u224	It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
s01_e03_c01_u001	(entering) Hi guys!
s01_e03_c01_u002	Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
s01_e03_c01_u003	Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
s01_e03_c01_u004	Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
s01_e03_c01_u005	Ohh. Ouch.
s01_e03_c01_u006	What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
s01_e03_c01_u007	Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
s01_e03_c01_u008	Since when?
s01_e03_c01_u009	Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
s01_e03_c01_u010	Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
s01_e03_c01_u011	Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
s01_e03_c01_u012	And everybody knows this?
s01_e03_c01_u013	Yeah. Cushions the blow.
s01_e03_c01_u014	Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
s01_e03_c01_u015	That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
s01_e03_c01_u016	Uh, Ross.
s01_e03_c01_u017	What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
s01_e03_c02_u018	"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
s01_e03_c02_u019	"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
s01_e03_c02_u020	Hey, that was really good!
s01_e03_c02_u021	Thanks! Let's keep going.
s01_e03_c02_u022	Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
s01_e03_c02_u023	"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
s01_e03_c02_u024	"Smoke away."
s01_e03_c02_u025	I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
s01_e03_c02_u026	What?
s01_e03_c02_u027	Relax your hand!
s01_e03_c02_u028	Not so much!
s01_e03_c02_u029	Whoah!
s01_e03_c02_u030	Hey!
s01_e03_c02_u031	Hey!
s01_e03_c02_u032	Alright, now try taking a puff.
s01_e03_c02_u033	Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
s01_e03_c02_u034	No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
s01_e03_c02_u035	It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
s01_e03_c02_u036	Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
s01_e03_c02_u037	Y'miss it?
s01_e03_c02_u038	Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
s01_e03_c03_u039	No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
s01_e03_c03_u040	That's ridiculous!
s01_e03_c03_u041	Can I use.. either thumb?
s01_e03_c03_u042	(carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
s01_e03_c03_u043	Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
s01_e03_c03_u044	(leaving to serve others) Good for me!
s01_e03_c03_u045	Y'okay, Phoebe?
s01_e03_c03_u046	Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
s01_e03_c03_u047	What did they do to you?
s01_e03_c03_u048	It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
s01_e03_c03_u049	Easy.
s01_e03_c03_u050	- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
s01_e03_c03_u051	Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
s01_e03_c03_u052	Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
s01_e03_c03_u053	What are you talking about? Keep it!
s01_e03_c03_u054	It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
s01_e03_c03_u055	Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
s01_e03_c03_u056	Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
s01_e03_c03_u057	We're with you. We got it.
s01_e03_c03_u058	Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
s01_e03_c03_u059	Chandler, what are you doing?
s01_e03_c03_u060	(puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?
s01_e03_c03_u061	Oh! Oh, God!
s01_e03_c03_u062	What is this?!
s01_e03_c03_u063	I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
s01_e03_c03_u064	Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
s01_e03_c03_u065	And this- is my reward!
s01_e03_c03_u066	Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
s01_e03_c03_u067	Okay, so this time I won't quit!
s01_e03_c03_u068	Ohhh! Put it out!
s01_e03_c03_u069	All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
s01_e03_c03_u070	Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
s01_e03_c03_u071	Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
s01_e03_c03_u072	This Alan again? How's it goin'?
s01_e03_c03_u073	'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
s01_e03_c03_u074	So when do we get to meet the guy?
s01_e03_c03_u075	Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
s01_e03_c03_u076	Oh, come on! Come on!
s01_e03_c03_u077	No. Not after what happened with Steve.
s01_e03_c03_u078	What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
s01_e03_c03_u079	Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
s01_e03_c03_u080	Well, then can we meet him?
s01_e03_c03_u081	Nope. Schhorry.
s01_e03_c04_u082	I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
s01_e03_c04_u083	Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
s01_e03_c04_u084	I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
s01_e03_c04_u085	Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
s01_e03_c05_u086	Let it go, Ross.
s01_e03_c05_u087	Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
s01_e03_c05_u088	Do you all promise?
s01_e03_c05_u089	Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
s01_e03_c05_u090	(shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
s01_e03_c05_u091	You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
s01_e03_c05_u092	Hey, Pheebs.
s01_e03_c05_u093	'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
s01_e03_c05_u094	What bank is this?
s01_e03_c05_u095	Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
s01_e03_c05_u096	(shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!
s01_e03_c05_u097	(to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
s01_e03_c05_u098	Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
s01_e03_c05_u099	Hi.
s01_e03_c05_u100	Hi, Alan.
s01_e03_c05_u101	I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
s01_e03_c05_u102	(to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
s01_e03_c05_u103	C'mon!
s01_e03_c05_u104	...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
s01_e03_c05_u105	Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
s01_e03_c05_u106	Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
s01_e03_c05_u107	Yeah!
s01_e03_c05_u108	And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)
s01_e03_c05_u109	Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
s01_e03_c05_u110	Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
s01_e03_c05_u111	...What shoe?
s01_e03_c05_u112	From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
s01_e03_c05_u113	...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
s01_e03_c05_u114	What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
s01_e03_c05_u115	Really!
s01_e03_c05_u116	Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)
s01_e03_c05_u117	You know what I like most about him, though?
s01_e03_c05_u118	What?
s01_e03_c05_u119	The way he makes me feel about myself.
s01_e03_c05_u120	Yeah...
s01_e03_c06_u121	Hi.. how was the game?
s01_e03_c06_u122	Well..
s01_e03_c06_u123	WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
s01_e03_c06_u124	Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
s01_e03_c06_u125	Alan.
s01_e03_c06_u126	He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
s01_e03_c06_u127	I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
s01_e03_c06_u128	Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
s01_e03_c06_u129	Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
s01_e03_c06_u130	What?
s01_e03_c06_u131	..I dunno, a little too Alan?
s01_e03_c06_u132	Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
s01_e03_c06_u133	Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
s01_e03_c06_u134	I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
s01_e03_c07_u135	Hey, Lizzie.
s01_e03_c07_u136	Hey, Weird Girl.
s01_e03_c07_u137	I brought you alphabet soup.
s01_e03_c07_u138	Did you pick out the vowels?
s01_e03_c07_u139	Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)
s01_e03_c07_u140	Saltines?
s01_e03_c07_u141	No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
s01_e03_c07_u142	What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there's really money in here.
s01_e03_c07_u143	I know.
s01_e03_c07_u144	Weird Girl, what are you doing?
s01_e03_c07_u145	No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
s01_e03_c07_u146	No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
s01_e03_c07_u147	Oh, that's fine, no.
s01_e03_c07_u148	Would you like my tin-foil hat?
s01_e03_c07_u149	No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
s01_e03_c07_u150	Please, let me do something.
s01_e03_c07_u151	Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
s01_e03_c07_u152	Okay.
s01_e03_c07_u153	Okay.
s01_e03_c09_u154	Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
s01_e03_c09_u155	No, I'm fine.
s01_e03_c09_u156	(leaves) See ya.
s01_e03_c09_u157	Huh!
s01_e03_c10_u158	A thumb?!
s01_e03_c10_u159	Eww!
s01_e03_c10_u160	I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
s01_e03_c10_u161	Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
s01_e03_c10_u162	Does, um, anyone wanna see?
s01_e03_c10_u163	Nooo!
s01_e03_c10_u164	Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
s01_e03_c10_u165	It's worse than the thumb!
s01_e03_c10_u166	Hey, this is so unfair!
s01_e03_c10_u167	Oh, why is it unfair?
s01_e03_c10_u168	So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
s01_e03_c10_u169	...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
s01_e03_c10_u170	Well, I-I could live without it.
s01_e03_c10_u171	Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
s01_e03_c10_u172	Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
s01_e03_c10_u173	Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"?
s01_e03_c10_u174	You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
s01_e03_c10_u175	"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
s01_e03_c10_u176	Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
s01_e03_c10_u177	Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
s01_e03_c11_u178	Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
s01_e03_c11_u179	No.
s01_e03_c11_u180	Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
s01_e03_c11_u181	Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
s01_e03_c11_u182	Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
s01_e03_c11_u183	Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
s01_e03_c11_u184	I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
s01_e03_c11_u185	Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
s01_e03_c11_u186	No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
s01_e03_c12_u187	Do you have any respect for your body?
s01_e03_c12_u188	Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
s01_e03_c12_u189	Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
s01_e03_c12_u190	(holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
s01_e03_c12_u191	Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
s01_e03_c12_u192	(to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good.
s01_e03_c12_u193	If only he were a woman.
s01_e03_c12_u194	Yeah.
s01_e03_c13_u195	Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
s01_e03_c13_u196	Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.)
s01_e03_c13_u197	(entering) Hey. Where's Joey?
s01_e03_c13_u198	Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
s01_e03_c13_u199	I think he's across the hall.
s01_e03_c13_u200	Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)
s01_e03_c13_u201	(finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go.
s01_e03_c13_u202	(deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
s01_e03_c13_u203	Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
s01_e03_c13_u204	Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
s01_e03_c13_u205	Hey, I might!
s01_e03_c13_u206	Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
s01_e03_c13_u207	You're kidding. Oh my God.
s01_e03_c13_u208	And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
s01_e03_c13_u209	(dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going on?
s01_e03_c13_u210	Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
s01_e03_c13_u211	Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
s01_e03_c13_u212	Uh, Joey..
s01_e03_c13_u213	Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)
s01_e03_c13_u214	(turns off the TV) Okay..
s01_e03_c13_u215	Oh! That was Lambchop!
s01_e03_c13_u216	Please, guys, we have to talk.
s01_e03_c13_u217	Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
s01_e03_c13_u218	Alright, we have to talk.
s01_e03_c13_u219	There it is!
s01_e03_c13_u220	Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
s01_e03_c13_u221	Is there somebody else?
s01_e03_c13_u222	No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
s01_e03_c13_u223	We didn't change..
s01_e03_c13_u224	So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
s01_e03_c13_u225	You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)
s01_e03_c13_u226	Look, I- I could go on pretending-
s01_e03_c13_u227	Okay!
s01_e03_c13_u228	-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
s01_e03_c13_u229	Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
s01_e03_c13_u230	I'm sorry..
s01_e03_c13_u231	(sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
s01_e03_c13_u232	(tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
s01_e03_c13_u233	I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
s01_e03_c13_u234	Oh, yeah! Right!
s01_e03_c13_u235	Are you guys gonna be okay?
s01_e03_c13_u236	Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
s01_e03_c13_u237	(dubious) I understand.
s01_e03_c14_u238	Wow.
s01_e03_c14_u239	I'm, I'm really sorry.
s01_e03_c14_u240	Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
s01_e03_c14_u241	Relieved?
s01_e03_c14_u242	Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.
s01_e03_c15_u243	Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
s01_e03_c15_u244	Yeah. He could row like a viking.
s01_e03_c15_u245	(entering) Hi.
s01_e03_c15_u246	Mmm.
s01_e03_c15_u247	So how'd it go?
s01_e03_c15_u248	Oh, y'know..
s01_e03_c15_u249	Did he mention us?
s01_e03_c15_u250	He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)
s01_e03_c15_u251	You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.)
s01_e03_c15_u252	...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
s01_e03_c15_u253	No no no!
s01_e03_c15_u254	(leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
s01_e03_c15_u255	(shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
s01_e03_c15_u256	(returns) Yeah, alright.
s05_e14_c01_u001	(looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
s05_e14_c01_u002	I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
s05_e14_c01_u003	Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
s05_e14_c01_u004	Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
s05_e14_c01_u005	And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
s05_e14_c01_u006	Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
s05_e14_c01_u007	Good idea! Yes!
s05_e14_c01_u008	It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
s05_e14_c01_u009	Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!
s05_e14_c01_u010	Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
s05_e14_c02_u011	Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
s05_e14_c02_u012	Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
s05_e14_c02_u013	It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
s05_e14_c02_u014	(laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)
s05_e14_c02_u015	Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)
s05_e14_c02_u016	(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
s05_e14_c02_u017	What?!
s05_e14_c02_u018	(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
s05_e14_c02_u019	Oh my God!
s05_e14_c02_u020	CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
s05_e14_c02_u021	OH MY GOD!!!
s05_e14_c02_u022	OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
s05_e14_c02_u023	Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
s05_e14_c02_u024	NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
s05_e14_c02_u025	I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
s05_e14_c02_u026	YOU KNOW?!!!
s05_e14_c02_u027	Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
s05_e14_c02_u028	(entering) What's going on?
s05_e14_c02_u029	(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!
s05_e14_c02_u030	What?! What?!
s05_e14_c02_u031	Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
s05_e14_c02_u032	Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
s05_e14_c02_u033	(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)
s05_e14_c03_u034	You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
s05_e14_c03_u035	Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
s05_e14_c03_u036	Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
s05_e14_c03_u037	(entering) Hey guys!
s05_e14_c03_u038	Joey! Come here! Come here!
s05_e14_c03_u039	What? What?
s05_e14_c03_u040	Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
s05_e14_c03_u041	You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)
s05_e14_c03_u042	No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
s05_e14_c03_u043	Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
s05_e14_c03_u044	Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
s05_e14_c03_u045	Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
s05_e14_c03_u046	Wh-what do you mean?
s05_e14_c03_u047	Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
s05_e14_c03_u048	Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
s05_e14_c03_u049	No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
s05_e14_c03_u050	Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
s05_e14_c03_u051	I can't take any
s05_e14_c03_u052	No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
s05_e14_c03_u053	Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
s05_e14_c03_u054	You don't have any secrets!
s05_e14_c03_u055	Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey shies away.)
s05_e14_c03_u056	(To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
s05_e14_c03_u057	Ugh.
s05_e14_c03_u058	Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
s05_e14_c03_u059	Okay.
s05_e14_c03_u060	And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
s05_e14_c03_u061	(entering) Hello children!
s05_e14_c03_u062	Hey!
s05_e14_c03_u063	Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
s05_e14_c03_u064	Hey.
s05_e14_c03_u065	Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
s05_e14_c03_u066	Really?
s05_e14_c03_u067	(feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
s05_e14_c03_u068	Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?
s05_e14_c03_u069	Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this.
s05_e14_c03_u070	Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
s05_e14_c03_u071	Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
s05_e14_c03_u072	What's going on?
s05_e14_c03_u073	I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
s05_e14_c04_u074	You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
s05_e14_c04_u075	Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
s05_e14_c04_u076	Okay, now you're even cuter!!
s05_e14_c04_u077	Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
s05_e14_c04_u078	What?
s05_e14_c04_u079	The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
s05_e14_c04_u080	What are you talking about?
s05_e14_c04_u081	I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
s05_e14_c04_u082	That's not possible!
s05_e14_c04_u083	Ow!
s05_e14_c04_u084	I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
s05_e14_c04_u085	Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
s05_e14_c04_u086	I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
s05_e14_c04_u087	No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
s05_e14_c04_u088	This bicep?
s05_e14_c04_u089	Well it's not flexed right now!
s05_e14_c05_u090	Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
s05_e14_c05_u091	Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
s05_e14_c05_u092	Oh.
s05_e14_c05_u093	Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
s05_e14_c05_u094	Sure, I'll do it with ya.
s05_e14_c05_u095	Okay.
s05_e14_c05_u096	Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
s05_e14_c05_u097	I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
s05_e14_c05_u098	I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)
s05_e14_c05_u099	(entering) Hey!
s05_e14_c05_u100	Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
s05_e14_c05_u101	Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
s05_e14_c05_u102	Oh.
s05_e14_c05_u103	No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
s05_e14_c05_u104	Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
s05_e14_c05_u105	No.
s05_e14_c05_u106	That new mountain bike?
s05_e14_c05_u107	No.
s05_e14_c05_u108	Well what did you send?
s05_e14_c05_u109	A basket of mini-muffins.
s05_e14_c05_u110	But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
s05_e14_c05_u111	The small one.
s05_e14_c05_u112	What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
s05_e14_c05_u113	Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
s05_e14_c05_u114	Your work makes me sad.
s05_e14_c05_u115	Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)
s05_e14_c05_u116	All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
s05_e14_c05_u117	Bye!
s05_e14_c05_u118	Bye!
s05_e14_c05_u119	Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)
s05_e14_c05_u120	(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
s05_e14_c05_u121	Actually, I did!
s05_e14_c05_u122	Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
s05_e14_c05_u123	Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
s05_e14_c05_u124	Are you serious?
s05_e14_c05_u125	Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
s05_e14_c05_u126	(a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
s05_e14_c06_u127	(entering) Joey!
s05_e14_c06_u128	Yeah?
s05_e14_c06_u129	Phoebe knows about us!
s05_e14_c06_u130	Well I didn't tell them!
s05_e14_c06_u131	Them?! Who's them?
s05_e14_c06_u132	Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
s05_e14_c06_u133	Joey!
s05_e14_c06_u134	And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
s05_e14_c06_u135	Oh man!
s05_e14_c06_u136	I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
s05_e14_c06_u137	Unless
s05_e14_c06_u138	No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
s05_e14_c06_u139	Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So
s05_e14_c06_u140	Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
s05_e14_c07_u141	Noooo.
s05_e14_c07_u142	Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
s05_e14_c07_u143	Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
s05_e14_c07_u144	Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
s05_e14_c07_u145	Y'know what you should do?
s05_e14_c07_u146	Huh?
s05_e14_c07_u147	You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
s05_e14_c07_u148	I'm listening.
s05_e14_c07_u149	(To Ross) See?
s05_e14_c07_u150	That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.
s05_e14_c07_u151	He broke that.
s05_e14_c07_u152	Well, he had gravity boots.
s05_e14_c07_u153	Yeah, he broke those too.
s05_e14_c07_u154	So he likes to break stuff.
s05_e14_c07_u155	Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
s05_e14_c07_u156	I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
s05_e14_c07_u157	Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
s05_e14_c07_u158	Right. (Exits.)
s05_e14_c07_u159	Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To Phoebe) It's Chandler.
s05_e14_c07_u160	(in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.
s05_e14_c07_u161	Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
s05_e14_c07_u162	Eh?
s05_e14_c07_u163	Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
s05_e14_c07_u164	Really?
s05_e14_c07_u165	Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
s05_e14_c07_u166	I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
s05_e14_c07_u167	Are you kidding?!
s05_e14_c07_u168	No!
s05_e14_c07_u169	I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?
s05_e14_c07_u170	No.
s05_e14_c07_u171	Joey!
s05_e14_c07_u172	They know you know.
s05_e14_c07_u173	Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
s05_e14_c07_u174	God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!
s05_e14_c07_u175	I couldn't even if I wanted too.
s05_e14_c08_u176	Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
s05_e14_c09_u177	(in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!
s05_e14_c09_u178	Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
s05_e14_c09_u179	Oh yeah!
s05_e14_c09_u180	All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.
s05_e14_c09_u181	All right. Be sexy.
s05_e14_c09_u182	(laughs) Please.
s05_e14_c09_u183	So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.
s05_e14_c09_u184	(initially worried, but gets over it) Really?
s05_e14_c09_u185	Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?
s05_e14_c09_u186	Yes.
s05_e14_c09_u187	Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
s05_e14_c09_u188	(looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
s05_e14_c09_u189	Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.)
s05_e14_c09_u190	Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
s05_e14_c10_u191	Show time!
s05_e14_c10_u192	Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
s05_e14_c10_u193	Okay! (She runs to get some.)
s05_e14_c10_u194	And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He begrudgingly does so.)
s05_e14_c10_u195	All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
s05_e14_c10_u196	Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
s05_e14_c10_u197	Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
s05_e14_c10_u198	How do you know?!
s05_e14_c10_u199	Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
s05_e14_c10_u200	At this?!
s05_e14_c10_u201	Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)
s05_e14_c10_u202	(handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
s05_e14_c10_u203	Okay.
s05_e14_c10_u204	Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)
s05_e14_c10_u205	Good idea!
s05_e14_c10_u206	Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.)
s05_e14_c10_u207	Oh now, don't give away the farm!
s05_e14_c10_u208	Phoebe.
s05_e14_c10_u209	Chandler.
s05_e14_c10_u210	Come on in.
s05_e14_c10_u211	I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
s05_e14_c10_u212	Sure.
s05_e14_c10_u213	So, here we are. Nervous?
s05_e14_c10_u214	Me? No. You?
s05_e14_c10_u215	No, I want this to happen.
s05_e14_c10_u216	So do I.
s05_e14_c10_u217	I'm gonna put on some music.
s05_e14_c10_u218	Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)
s05_e14_c10_u219	You look good.
s05_e14_c10_u220	Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
s05_e14_c10_u221	Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
s05_e14_c10_u222	Really?
s05_e14_c10_u223	Oh, do you not want to?
s05_e14_c10_u224	No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
s05_e14_c10_u225	(swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
s05_e14_c10_u226	Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
s05_e14_c10_u227	She's bluffing!
s05_e14_c10_u228	Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
s05_e14_c10_u229	He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
s05_e14_c10_u230	(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
s05_e14_c10_u231	Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
s05_e14_c10_u232	Ooh!
s05_e14_c10_u233	Okay!
s05_e14_c10_u234	I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
s05_e14_c10_u235	Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
s05_e14_c10_u236	It's not my first time.
s05_e14_c10_u237	You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
s05_e14_c10_u238	Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
s05_e14_c10_u239	Of course.
s05_e14_c10_u240	Oh, you're-you're going?
s05_e14_c10_u241	Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
s05_e14_c10_u242	(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
s05_e14_c10_u243	You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
s05_e14_c10_u244	Not if I kiss you first.
s05_e14_c10_u245	Ooh.
s05_e14_c10_u246	Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
s05_e14_c10_u247	Here it comes. Our first kiss.
s05_e14_c10_u248	Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
s05_e14_c10_u249	And why not?!
s05_e14_c10_u250	Because I'm in love with Monica!!
s05_e14_c10_u251	You're-you're what?!
s05_e14_c10_u252	Love her! That's right, I-LOVE-HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
s05_e14_c10_u253	I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)
s05_e14_c10_u254	I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
s05_e14_c10_u255	Dude!
s05_e14_c10_u256	And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.
s05_e14_c10_u257	God! (She turns and buttons up.)
s05_e14_c10_u258	All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
s05_e14_c10_u259	Well actually, Ross doesn't.
s05_e14_c10_u260	Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
s05_e14_c11_u261	A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.
s05_e14_c11_u262	I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
s05_e14_c11_u263	Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
s05_e14_c11_u264	I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
s05_e14_c11_u265	Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh- What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
s05_e17_c01_u001	Good, you guys are all here!
s05_e17_c01_u002	Hey! What's up?
s05_e17_c01_u003	Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
s05_e17_c01_u004	Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
s05_e17_c01_u005	I know!
s05_e17_c01_u006	Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
s05_e17_c01_u007	Wh-what?!
s05_e17_c01_u008	I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
s05_e17_c01_u009	Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
s05_e17_c01_u010	Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
s05_e17_c01_u011	Yeah.
s05_e17_c01_u012	You wanna work on your interview skills?
s05_e17_c01_u013	O-okay!
s05_e17_c01_u014	Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
s05_e17_c01_u015	Hi.
s05_e17_c01_u016	Very good handshake, good wrist action.
s05_e17_c01_u017	Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)
s05_e17_c01_u018	Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)
s05_e17_c01_u019	Did I squeeze it too hard?
s05_e17_c01_u020	Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
s05_e17_c02_u021	That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.
s05_e17_c02_u022	Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
s05_e17_c02_u023	Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
s05_e17_c02_u024	(waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.) (Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
s05_e17_c02_u025	Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
s05_e17_c02_u026	Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.) Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor
s05_e17_c02_u027	(joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?
s05_e17_c02_u028	Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica away and makes a disgusted face.)
s05_e17_c03_u029	Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
s05_e17_c03_u030	This is your place?
s05_e17_c03_u031	Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)
s05_e17_c03_u032	But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)
s05_e17_c04_u033	Ugh!!
s05_e17_c04_u034	What happened?
s05_e17_c04_u035	I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. (Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on his remote.)
s05_e17_c04_u036	No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
s05_e17_c05_u037	Okay, now I've really have to go!
s05_e17_c05_u038	But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
s05_e17_c05_u039	I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
s05_e17_c05_u040	Okay, then maybe I can come too!
s05_e17_c05_u041	All right, you go. (They kiss.)
s05_e17_c05_u042	Bye-bye.
s05_e17_c05_u043	'Kay, bye!
s05_e17_c05_u044	Oh God!
s05_e17_c05_u045	What?
s05_e17_c05_u046	Oh I just miss him so much!
s05_e17_c05_u047	Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
s05_e17_c05_u048	Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
s05_e17_c05_u049	I know it is the best.
s05_e17_c05_u050	So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
s05_e17_c05_u051	What? It's still going on.
s05_e17_c05_u052	Come on, seriously! When did it end?
s05_e17_c05_u053	I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
s05_e17_c05_u054	Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
s05_e17_c05_u055	(Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
s05_e17_c05_u056	(Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
s05_e17_c05_u057	Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
s05_e17_c05_u058	(entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
s05_e17_c05_u059	You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)
s05_e17_c06_u060	Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
s05_e17_c06_u061	Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
s05_e17_c06_u062	Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
s05_e17_c06_u063	No!
s05_e17_c06_u064	So what happened?
s05_e17_c06_u065	Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not amused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
s05_e17_c06_u066	What happened?
s05_e17_c06_u067	(We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me- Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh- (The flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)
s05_e17_c06_u068	You kissed him?!
s05_e17_c06_u069	Well, I didn't know what else to do!
s05_e17_c06_u070	Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
s05_e17_c06_u071	Thanks Chandler.
s05_e17_c06_u072	(entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
s05_e17_c06_u073	I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
s05_e17_c06_u074	Yes!
s05_e17_c06_u075	I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
s05_e17_c06_u076	What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
s05_e17_c06_u077	Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?
s05_e17_c06_u078	A kiss? What are you talking about?
s05_e17_c06_u079	I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
s05_e17_c06_u080	Come on, Rach.
s05_e17_c06_u081	Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
s05_e17_c06_u082	He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
s05_e17_c06_u083	Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
s05_e17_c06_u084	Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's back!
s05_e17_c06_u085	Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
s05_e17_c06_u086	No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. (He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)
s05_e17_c06_u087	I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)
s05_e17_c07_u088	Damnit!! Did you move?!
s05_e17_c07_u089	Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey just stares at him) I'm Ross.
s05_e17_c07_u090	Yes?
s05_e17_c07_u091	(Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
s05_e17_c07_u092	No. I'm all alone.
s05_e17_c07_u093	Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
s05_e17_c07_u094	Daddy!!
s05_e17_c07_u095	Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!
s05_e17_c08_u096	Hi Rachel!
s05_e17_c08_u097	Hi!
s05_e17_c08_u098	Come on in.
s05_e17_c08_u099	It's really nice to see you again.
s05_e17_c08_u100	Thank you.
s05_e17_c08_u101	(Sees that she has some ink on her lip from her pen.) Oh Rachel, uhh- (He points to his lip to get her to notice the ink on hers.)
s05_e17_c08_u102	What?
s05_e17_c08_u103	Just ah- (He points again.)
s05_e17_c08_u104	Excuse me?
s05_e17_c08_u105	Here let me- (He goes to wipe it off himself.)
s05_e17_c08_u106	(stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)
s05_e17_c09_u107	(entering) Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
s05_e17_c09_u108	Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
s05_e17_c09_u109	You got ink on your lip.
s05_e17_c09_u110	Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh-.
s05_e17_c10_u111	(To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
s05_e17_c10_u112	I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
s05_e17_c10_u113	Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you- (He gestures and spills some of his coffee.)
s05_e17_c10_u114	Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
s05_e17_c10_u115	Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
s05_e17_c10_u116	Oh we can't, we already have plans.
s05_e17_c10_u117	What are you doing?
s05_e17_c10_u118	Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
s05_e17_c10_u119	(That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
s05_e17_c10_u120	You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
s05_e17_c10_u121	Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
s05_e17_c10_u122	Yeah!
s05_e17_c10_u123	Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
s05_e17_c10_u124	Uh, yeah.
s05_e17_c10_u125	Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
s05_e17_c10_u126	Why?
s05_e17_c10_u127	'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
s05_e17_c10_u128	Ohh, so?
s05_e17_c10_u129	So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
s05_e17_c10_u130	Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
s05_e17_c11_u131	(to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!
s05_e17_c11_u132	(To Ross) Excuse me. (He puts up a flyer that has a sketch drawing of Joey and it reads, "Warning! Intruder! If you see this creep - call the cops!") You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
s05_e17_c11_u133	(to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't?
s05_e17_c11_u134	I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
s05_e17_c11_u135	I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
s05_e17_c11_u136	Nevermind! (Goes back to his mailbox.)
s05_e17_c11_u137	No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
s05_e17_c11_u138	I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm
s05_e17_c11_u139	Jen.
s05_e17_c11_u140	Jen, I know this may sound a little-(makes some kind of crazy noise) But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
s05_e17_c11_u141	Sure! That would be nice.
s05_e17_c11_u142	Umm?
s05_e17_c11_u143	Oh! My number is on there. (Hands him a business card.) Give me a call.
s05_e17_c11_u144	I will give you a call.
s05_e17_c11_u145	I'll see you later. (Starts to walk away.)
s05_e17_c11_u146	Okay!
s05_e17_c11_u147	I forgot my paper. (Ross quickly hides the card in his mouth.)
s05_e17_c12_u148	That was amazing!
s05_e17_c12_u149	Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
s05_e17_c12_u150	That was amazing.
s05_e17_c12_u151	We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
s05_e17_c12_u152	No, you're the best.
s05_e17_c12_u153	No, you're the best.
s05_e17_c12_u154	No, you're the best.
s05_e17_c12_u155	I am the best.
s05_e17_c12_u156	(entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'? (Has a silly grin.)
s05_e17_c12_u157	(looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
s05_e17_c12_u158	I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.) Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
s05_e17_c12_u159	Why?
s05_e17_c12_u160	Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
s05_e17_c12_u161	What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
s05_e17_c12_u162	No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
s05_e17_c12_u163	No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
s05_e17_c12_u164	I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
s05_e17_c13_u165	So uhh, you ready?
s05_e17_c13_u166	Sure, I'll just get my coat. (There's a knock on the door.) Could you get that?
s05_e17_c13_u167	Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.) Joey
s05_e17_c13_u168	Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)
s05_e17_c14_u169	Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
s05_e17_c14_u170	That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
s05_e17_c14_u171	(looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
s05_e17_c14_u172	Fair enough.
s05_e17_c14_u173	Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr
s05_e17_c14_u174	Zelner.
s05_e17_c14_u175	Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
s05_e17_c14_u176	Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
s05_e17_c14_u177	(gasps) Oh! You are?
s05_e17_c14_u178	Um-hmm.
s05_e17_c14_u179	Really? Oh thank you! Oh- Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
s05_e17_c14_u180	Yes!
s05_e17_c14_u181	Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday! (Exits.)
s05_e17_c15_u182	You tired Chandler?
s05_e17_c15_u183	You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
s05_e17_c15_u184	Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
s05_e17_c15_u185	So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
s05_e17_c15_u186	Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)
s05_e17_c15_u187	Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
s05_e17_c15_u188	Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
s05_e17_c15_u189	Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so
s05_e17_c15_u190	You didn't!
s05_e17_c15_u191	We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
s05_e17_c15_u192	The park huh? A public place.
s05_e17_c15_u193	Uh-huh.
s05_e17_c15_u194	I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)
s05_e17_c15_u195	Hi Chandler.
s05_e17_c15_u196	Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?
s05_e17_c15_u197	Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
s05_e17_c15_u198	No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
s05_e17_c15_u199	Come on, we can't let them win!
s05_e17_c15_u200	Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
s05_e17_c15_u201	Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
s05_e17_c15_u202	(gasps) So?
s05_e17_c15_u203	I feel really sad that we're not-really there anymore.
s05_e17_c15_u204	Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
s05_e17_c15_u205	Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
s05_e17_c15_u206	Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
s05_e17_c15_u207	Really?
s05_e17_c15_u208	Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)
s05_e17_c15_u209	That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
s05_e17_c15_u210	Yeah?
s05_e17_c15_u211	Yeah. (They hug.)
s05_e17_c15_u212	Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
s05_e17_c15_u213	Did not.
s05_e17_c15_u214	Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
s05_e17_c15_u215	Okay, I freaked out a little.
s05_e17_c15_u216	Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.
s05_e17_c16_u217	(laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
s05_e17_c16_u218	Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
s05_e17_c16_u219	(entering) You guys ready fore the movies?
s05_e17_c16_u220	Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
s05_e17_c16_u221	(from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot and waves at the cutouts.)
s05_e07_c01_u001	Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
s05_e07_c01_u002	No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)
s05_e07_c01_u003	That's a pig.
s05_e07_c01_u004	I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
s05_e07_c01_u005	Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
s05_e07_c01_u006	Emily's cousin kicked me out!
s05_e07_c01_u007	What?!
s05_e07_c01_u008	Why?
s05_e07_c01_u009	Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
s05_e07_c01_u010	How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
s05_e07_c01_u011	Who needs a lease when it's family!
s05_e07_c01_u012	Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
s05_e07_c01_u013	Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
s05_e07_c01_u014	Yeah.
s05_e07_c01_u015	You got it.
s05_e07_c01_u016	Okay.
s05_e07_c01_u017	Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
s05_e07_c01_u018	What?
s05_e07_c01_u019	He thought you said gonad.
s05_e07_c02_u020	Oh, Larry.
s05_e07_c02_u021	Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
s05_e07_c02_u022	No, bribes.
s05_e07_c02_u023	It's okay to laugh right?
s05_e07_c02_u024	Yeah, I was just kidding.
s05_e07_c02_u025	Okay. (She laughs harder.)
s05_e07_c02_u026	I'll check the kitchen floors.
s05_e07_c02_u027	Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
s05_e07_c02_u028	Yum-my!
s05_e07_c02_u029	Larry?
s05_e07_c02_u030	Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
s05_e07_c02_u031	(entering) A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
s05_e07_c02_u032	Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
s05_e07_c02_u033	And where is your hat?
s05_e07_c02_u034	It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
s05_e07_c02_u035	Ahh that's the 2 points.
s05_e07_c02_u036	Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
s05_e07_c02_u037	Oh, I don't know about that.
s05_e07_c02_u038	Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
s05_e07_c02_u039	Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
s05_e07_c02_u040	Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
s05_e07_c02_u041	I-I'll call ya.
s05_e07_c02_u042	Okay.
s05_e07_c02_u043	He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)
s05_e07_c03_u044	Thanks.
s05_e07_c03_u045	Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?
s05_e07_c03_u046	Hmm?
s05_e07_c03_u047	How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
s05_e07_c03_u048	He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try
s05_e07_c03_u049	Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
s05_e07_c03_u050	Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
s05_e07_c03_u051	(To Gunther) Two pounds of Moca Java please.
s05_e07_c03_u052	(To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
s05_e07_c03_u053	I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
s05_e07_c03_u054	(To them) Hey!
s05_e07_c03_u055	Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?
s05_e07_c03_u056	Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
s05_e07_c03_u057	Ohh, fun!
s05_e07_c03_u058	Ohh, great!
s05_e07_c03_u059	Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
s05_e07_c03_u060	Yeah.
s05_e07_c03_u061	Okay, see ya. (Heads out.)
s05_e07_c03_u062	Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
s05_e07_c03_u063	(laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
s05_e07_c03_u064	And you're not gonna do that.
s05_e07_c03_u065	That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
s05_e07_c03_u066	So-so there is no party.
s05_e07_c03_u067	No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
s05_e07_c03_u068	I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
s05_e07_c03_u069	Exactly.
s05_e07_c04_u070	Ross?
s05_e07_c04_u071	(entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!
s05_e07_c04_u072	Love what you've done with the place.
s05_e07_c04_u073	Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
s05_e07_c04_u074	Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
s05_e07_c04_u075	Oh yeah!
s05_e07_c04_u076	Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!
s05_e07_c04_u077	Hey, all right!
s05_e07_c04_u078	Pretty cool, huh?
s05_e07_c04_u079	(To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?
s05_e07_c04_u080	Oh, the tears are real.
s05_e07_c05_u081	You look beautiful this evening.
s05_e07_c05_u082	(smiles) Show me the badge again.
s05_e07_c05_u083	Shiny.
s05_e07_c05_u084	Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies (Holds up his hands) have been.
s05_e07_c05_u085	(laughing) You are just nonstop!
s05_e07_c05_u086	(coming back) We're outta here!
s05_e07_c05_u087	Why?!
s05_e07_c05_u088	Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
s05_e07_c05_u089	(awed) You have the power to do that?
s05_e07_c05_u090	This does. (Shows her his badge.)
s05_e07_c05_u091	(excited) Shut it down.
s05_e07_c06_u092	Hey.
s05_e07_c06_u093	What are you doing?
s05_e07_c06_u094	Nothing.
s05_e07_c06_u095	You built a fort didn't ya?
s05_e07_c06_u096	(smiles) Kinda.
s05_e07_c06_u097	(notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
s05_e07_c06_u098	Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
s05_e07_c06_u099	I hate this thing!
s05_e07_c06_u100	Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
s05_e07_c07_u101	Oh, hi Danny.
s05_e07_c07_u102	Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
s05_e07_c07_u103	Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
s05_e07_c07_u104	Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
s05_e07_c07_u105	You are?
s05_e07_c07_u106	Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
s05_e07_c07_u107	Yeah, what's the gala for?
s05_e07_c07_u108	It's a uh, regatta gala.
s05_e07_c07_u109	Really! You-you sail?
s05_e07_c07_u110	No-no, but I support it.
s05_e07_c07_u111	Okay, (To Monica) hope I see you tomorrow night.
s05_e07_c07_u112	Okay.
s05_e07_c07_u113	Take care. (Leaves.)
s05_e07_c07_u114	Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?
s05_e07_c07_u115	What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
s05_e07_c07_u116	Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
s05_e07_c07_u117	Great. So the ball is in his court?
s05_e07_c07_u118	Ball? There is no ball.
s05_e07_c08_u119	(glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)
s05_e07_c08_u120	Sorry.
s05_e07_c08_u121	Ahhhhhhhhhh
s05_e07_c08_u122	(entering) Hello children!
s05_e07_c08_u123	Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
s05_e07_c08_u124	Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
s05_e07_c08_u125	No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
s05_e07_c08_u126	All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? (Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)
s05_e07_c08_u127	Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
s05_e07_c08_u128	No, the quiet down thing!
s05_e07_c08_u129	You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
s05_e07_c08_u130	Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
s05_e07_c08_u131	(gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
s05_e07_c08_u132	All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
s05_e07_c08_u133	Okay.
s05_e07_c08_u134	No-no-no-no!
s05_e07_c08_u135	YES!!
s05_e07_c08_u136	(entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)
s05_e07_c08_u137	Okay, so he's out of here.
s05_e07_c08_u138	Um-hmm.
s05_e07_c09_u139	(entering) Hey!
s05_e07_c09_u140	Hey!
s05_e07_c09_u141	You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
s05_e07_c09_u142	Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
s05_e07_c09_u143	Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
s05_e07_c09_u144	I don't know, clean places?
s05_e07_c09_u145	Umm, yum!
s05_e07_c09_u146	(looking through the peephole) It's Danny.
s05_e07_c09_u147	Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
s05_e07_c09_u148	(to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it starts later?
s05_e07_c09_u149	What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
s05_e07_c09_u150	The fake kind!
s05_e07_c09_u151	Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
s05_e07_c09_u152	We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)
s05_e07_c09_u153	Thanks, see you at the party.
s05_e07_c09_u154	Okay, great!
s05_e07_c09_u155	Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle." (Laughs.)
s05_e07_c10_u156	Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
s05_e07_c10_u157	I'll take sports.
s05_e07_c10_u158	Mine! (He grabs it.)
s05_e07_c10_u159	All right. Uhh, international.
s05_e07_c10_u160	Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!
s05_e07_c10_u161	Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
s05_e07_c10_u162	Not even on page 7?
s05_e07_c10_u163	(looks) Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
s05_e07_c10_u164	What about that circled one?
s05_e07_c10_u165	Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
s05_e07_c10_u166	But it's available now! Isn't it?
s05_e07_c10_u167	Yes, it is.
s05_e07_c10_u168	Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)
s05_e07_c10_u169	Okay, let's go.
s05_e07_c10_u170	Okay!
s05_e07_c10_u171	There we go!
s05_e07_c10_u172	Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
s05_e07_c10_u173	Let's go quicker.
s05_e07_c10_u174	Yeah!
s05_e07_c11_u175	Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)
s05_e07_c11_u176	Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
s05_e07_c11_u177	Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
s05_e07_c11_u178	I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
s05_e07_c11_u179	But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
s05_e07_c11_u180	Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
s05_e07_c11_u181	Yeah.
s05_e07_c11_u182	(To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
s05_e07_c11_u183	Oh, it's perfect!
s05_e07_c11_u184	(To Chandler) How about you?
s05_e07_c11_u185	It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
s05_e07_c11_u186	All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
s05_e07_c11_u187	We are bad people.
s05_e07_c11_u188	He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
s05_e07_c12_u189	(entering) Hey, ready for dinner?
s05_e07_c12_u190	Ooh, absolutely!
s05_e07_c12_u191	Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
s05_e07_c12_u192	Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.
s05_e07_c12_u193	How about Mama Lisettie's?
s05_e07_c12_u194	Enh. Sure!
s05_e07_c12_u195	(notices something) I wonder how long that milk (on the counter) has been setting out.
s05_e07_c12_u196	Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!
s05_e07_c12_u197	Hey, buddy! (Flashes his badge.) Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
s05_e07_c12_u198	But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
s05_e07_c12_u199	Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
s05_e07_c12_u200	Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
s05_e07_c12_u201	Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
s05_e07_c12_u202	Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
s05_e07_c13_u203	Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
s05_e07_c13_u204	Yes that was a nice place!
s05_e07_c13_u205	Yeah!
s05_e07_c13_u206	Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
s05_e07_c13_u207	Yeah!
s05_e07_c13_u208	What are we gonna do?
s05_e07_c13_u209	I don't know. Maybe pizza?
s05_e07_c13_u210	About Ross!
s05_e07_c13_u211	Oh! Oh!
s05_e07_c13_u212	Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
s05_e07_c13_u213	(grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?
s05_e07_c13_u214	Ohhhhh!
s05_e07_c14_u215	Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
s05_e07_c14_u216	Just go over and say hi.
s05_e07_c14_u217	No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
s05_e07_c14_u218	Hey, Danny!
s05_e07_c14_u219	Hey! What's going on?
s05_e07_c14_u220	(turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm, what's this? (Points to his plate.)
s05_e07_c14_u221	Salad.
s05_e07_c14_u222	Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and what-what's this? (Points again.)
s05_e07_c14_u223	Bread. Aren't you a chef?
s05_e07_c14_u224	(upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.
s05_e07_c14_u225	Hey! Rachel!
s05_e07_c14_u226	Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.
s05_e07_c14_u227	Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
s05_e07_c14_u228	Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
s05_e07_c14_u229	Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. (He heads off.)
s05_e07_c14_u230	Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?
s05_e07_c14_u231	I thought there wasn't a ball?
s05_e07_c14_u232	Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
s05_e07_c14_u233	(returning, with a friend) Rachel, this is my friend Tom. (To Tom) This is the girl I told you about.
s05_e07_c14_u234	Oh, go on! You telling people about me?
s05_e07_c14_u235	You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle. (Leaves.)
s05_e07_c14_u236	So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh? My mom calls it Bloomies.
s05_e07_c14_u237	(laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!
s05_e07_c14_u238	I'm sorry?
s05_e07_c14_u239	No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
s05_e07_c14_u240	I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
s05_e07_c14_u241	Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, "Nice try."
s05_e07_c14_u242	Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
s05_e07_c14_u243	I think I need a drink.
s05_e07_c14_u244	Yeah!
s05_e07_c15_u245	98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
s05_e07_c15_u246	(getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)
s05_e07_c15_u247	Here we go! Here we go!
s05_e07_c15_u248	Hey!
s05_e07_c15_u249	Hey!
s05_e07_c15_u250	Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
s05_e07_c15_u251	You're kidding!
s05_e07_c15_u252	You're kidding, no!
s05_e07_c15_u253	Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So
s05_e07_c15_u254	But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
s05_e07_c15_u255	Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
s05_e07_c15_u256	Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!
s05_e07_c15_u257	Yeah!
s05_e07_c15_u258	Are you guys sure about this?
s05_e07_c15_u259	Definitely!
s05_e07_c15_u260	Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
s05_e07_c15_u261	All right.
s05_e07_c15_u262	All right!
s05_e07_c15_u263	All right, buddy!
s05_e07_c15_u264	So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the 'quiet down' maneuver).
s05_e07_c16_u265	Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
s05_e07_c16_u266	(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
s05_e07_c16_u267	All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
s05_e07_c16_u268	Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
s09_e06_c01_u001	(picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?
s09_e06_c01_u002	(in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
s09_e06_c01_u003	Honey, you're screaming.
s09_e06_c01_u004	YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
s09_e06_c01_u005	(yawning) Oh, that's great.
s09_e06_c01_u006	Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
s09_e06_c01_u007	(clearly not so interested) Awesome.
s09_e06_c01_u008	Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)
s09_e06_c02_u009	This is nice.
s09_e06_c02_u010	I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
s09_e06_c02_u011	You need both hands for that?
s09_e06_c02_u012	Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)
s09_e06_c02_u013	(in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)
s09_e06_c02_u014	I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
s09_e06_c02_u015	Is it?
s09_e06_c02_u016	(in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?
s09_e06_c02_u017	Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
s09_e06_c02_u018	(impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
s09_e06_c02_u019	Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking for. A key.)
s09_e06_c02_u020	Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
s09_e06_c02_u021	It's to my apartment.
s09_e06_c02_u022	(really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
s09_e06_c02_u023	Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...
s09_e06_c02_u024	Oh no, I want to.
s09_e06_c02_u025	Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from her bag.)
s09_e06_c02_u026	Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)
s09_e06_c02_u027	Is this cool, huh?
s09_e06_c02_u028	It really is.
s09_e06_c02_u029	(sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)
s09_e06_c03_u030	So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
s09_e06_c03_u031	(in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)
s09_e06_c03_u032	That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?
s09_e06_c03_u033	Not really.
s09_e06_c03_u034	Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)
s09_e06_c03_u035	Thank you.
s09_e06_c03_u036	Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
s09_e06_c03_u037	Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug testing?
s09_e06_c03_u038	Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
s09_e06_c03_u039	That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
s09_e06_c03_u040	Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
s09_e06_c03_u041	Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
s09_e06_c03_u042	(indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?
s09_e06_c03_u043	She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
s09_e06_c03_u044	Okay... (Ross opens the door.)
s09_e06_c03_u045	(a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.
s09_e06_c03_u046	And she's a little mannish...
s09_e06_c04_u047	(gasps) Oh my God! David!
s09_e06_c04_u048	Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
s09_e06_c04_u049	(excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
s09_e06_c04_u050	Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
s09_e06_c04_u051	Who cares, it got you here.
s09_e06_c04_u052	Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
s09_e06_c04_u053	Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)
s09_e06_c04_u054	Damn it!
s09_e06_c04_u055	A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
s09_e06_c04_u056	Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!
s09_e06_c04_u057	Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.
s09_e06_c04_u058	Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. (Phoebe seems very charmed) Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone? (Phoebe is still up on a cloud from what David just said)
s09_e06_c04_u059	No...
s09_e06_c05_u060	I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
s09_e06_c05_u061	Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
s09_e06_c05_u062	He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
s09_e06_c05_u063	Oh, well... That had been your window.
s09_e06_c05_u064	Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
s09_e06_c05_u065	Really? The scientist guy?
s09_e06_c05_u066	Really? Chandler?
s09_e06_c05_u067	Continue...
s09_e06_c05_u068	Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
s09_e06_c05_u069	Phoebe!
s09_e06_c05_u070	I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
s09_e06_c05_u071	Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
s09_e06_c05_u072	(sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
s09_e06_c05_u073	What are you gonna do?
s09_e06_c05_u074	I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
s09_e06_c05_u075	You have to tell David!
s09_e06_c05_u076	Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
s09_e06_c06_u077	(angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)
s09_e06_c06_u078	Heeeeeey!
s09_e06_c06_u079	Hey!
s09_e06_c06_u080	Hey!
s09_e06_c06_u081	So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
s09_e06_c06_u082	(Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?
s09_e06_c06_u083	(laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
s09_e06_c06_u084	Okay. (and she walks away)
s09_e06_c06_u085	What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
s09_e06_c06_u086	No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
s09_e06_c06_u087	Yeah, he came up...
s09_e06_c06_u088	Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)
s09_e06_c06_u089	(to Phoebe) Were you there?
s09_e06_c06_u090	No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
s09_e06_c07_u091	I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)
s09_e06_c07_u092	Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
s09_e06_c07_u093	Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)
s09_e06_c07_u094	Ross!
s09_e06_c07_u095	It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.
s09_e06_c07_u096	Oh!
s09_e06_c07_u097	Her name is Deliah.
s09_e06_c07_u098	Oh, that's pretty.
s09_e06_c07_u099	(skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
s09_e06_c07_u100	I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.
s09_e06_c07_u101	(on a yeah, right tone) Okay.
s09_e06_c07_u102	Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... (Ross and Rachel look puzzled) That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... (points at his heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his sentence. Rachel tries to comfort him, but Ross has this "you've got to be kidding me" look all over him)
s09_e06_c07_u103	Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)
s09_e06_c07_u104	Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
s09_e06_c07_u105	Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
s09_e06_c07_u106	Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I love him, I love him...
s09_e06_c07_u107	Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
s09_e06_c07_u108	So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
s09_e06_c07_u109	Because, it's weird!
s09_e06_c07_u110	Why?
s09_e06_c07_u111	What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
s09_e06_c07_u112	(she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) Yes?
s09_e06_c07_u113	King?
s09_e06_c07_u114	I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)
s09_e06_c07_u115	(whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.
s09_e06_c07_u116	That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...
s09_e06_c07_u117	You gotta be at least bi...
s09_e06_c08_u118	Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
s09_e06_c08_u119	Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
s09_e06_c08_u120	(Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
s09_e06_c08_u121	I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
s09_e06_c08_u122	Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
s09_e06_c08_u123	Seriously? She actually said that?
s09_e06_c08_u124	Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
s09_e06_c08_u125	Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
s09_e06_c08_u126	Yeah!
s09_e06_c08_u127	Without that, you just got "lame with women".
s09_e06_c08_u128	Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)
s09_e06_c08_u129	Hi! There you are.
s09_e06_c08_u130	(sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)
s09_e06_c09_u131	Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
s09_e06_c09_u132	Oof...
s09_e06_c09_u133	In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)
s09_e06_c09_u134	Oh, wait, wait!
s09_e06_c09_u135	Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...
s09_e06_c09_u136	No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
s09_e06_c09_u137	Oh... oh...
s09_e06_c09_u138	Yeah, I should have told you.
s09_e06_c09_u139	No... well, yeah.
s09_e06_c09_u140	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
s09_e06_c09_u141	Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?
s09_e06_c09_u142	I am happy.
s09_e06_c09_u143	Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...
s09_e06_c09_u144	Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
s09_e06_c09_u145	Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?
s09_e06_c09_u146	Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
s09_e06_c09_u147	No... no...
s09_e06_c09_u148	I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)
s09_e06_c09_u149	In Minsk...
s09_e06_c09_u150	Yeah?
s09_e06_c09_u151	...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.
s09_e06_c09_u152	Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
s09_e06_c10_u153	(in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...
s09_e06_c10_u154	(very worried) Is everything allright?
s09_e06_c10_u155	Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.
s09_e06_c10_u156	Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
s09_e06_c10_u157	I can't... I can't hear it again.
s09_e06_c10_u158	You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears again)
s09_e06_c10_u159	And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a "why do you say that" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?
s09_e06_c10_u160	Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)
s09_e06_c10_u161	Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
s09_e06_c10_u162	Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.
s09_e06_c10_u163	(picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)
s09_e06_c10_u164	What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
s09_e06_c10_u165	(speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!
s09_e06_c10_u166	Sandy made Madeleines.
s09_e06_c10_u167	This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)
s09_e06_c10_u168	Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
s09_e06_c10_u169	Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
s09_e06_c10_u170	Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)
s09_e06_c11_u171	Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
s09_e06_c11_u172	But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
s09_e06_c11_u173	No, no. No.
s09_e06_c11_u174	But... ergo...
s09_e06_c11_u175	Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
s09_e06_c11_u176	Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)
s09_e06_c11_u177	Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't want to believe what's happening)
s09_e06_c11_u178	(points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
s09_e06_c12_u179	Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
s09_e06_c12_u180	Yeah! I think that's great!
s09_e06_c12_u181	Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
s09_e06_c12_u182	Oh... How are they?
s09_e06_c12_u183	(looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)
s09_e06_c12_u184	Hey!
s09_e06_c12_u185	Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
s09_e06_c12_u186	(looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
s09_e06_c12_u187	Thank you!
s09_e06_c12_u188	That's like a woman wanting to be a...
s09_e06_c12_u189	...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
s09_e06_c12_u190	Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
s09_e06_c12_u191	Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
s09_e06_c12_u192	Yeah, so?
s09_e06_c12_u193	Wow!
s09_e06_c12_u194	Really? Do you not know Chandler?
s09_e06_c12_u195	Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
s09_e06_c12_u196	So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)
s09_e06_c12_u197	Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
s09_e06_c12_u198	...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)
s09_e06_c12_u199	I can't believe he's that upset about this...
s09_e06_c12_u200	Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)
s09_e06_c12_u201	Hey!
s09_e06_c12_u202	Heeeyy! Hey!
s09_e06_c12_u203	What are you guys talking about?
s09_e06_c12_u204	Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like "Can you believe that?")
s09_e06_c12_u205	You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)
s09_e06_c12_u206	You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)
s09_e06_c12_u207	Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
s09_e06_c12_u208	If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
s09_e06_c12_u209	Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)
s09_e06_c12_u210	What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)
s09_e06_c12_u211	Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)
s09_e06_c12_u212	Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)
s09_e06_c12_u213	Yeah....
s09_e06_c12_u214	So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)
s09_e06_c12_u215	Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
s09_e06_c12_u216	Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
s09_e06_c12_u217	Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
s09_e06_c12_u218	I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
s09_e06_c12_u219	Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.
s09_e06_c12_u220	Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)
s09_e06_c12_u221	Not knowing when to shut up...
s09_e06_c12_u222	Yep! That's my thing...
s09_e06_c13_u223	So... how many guys have your key?
s09_e06_c13_u224	No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
s09_e06_c13_u225	Your lipstick's on his mouth.
s09_e06_c13_u226	Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
s09_e06_c13_u227	No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
s09_e06_c13_u228	Did you uhm...
s09_e06_c13_u229	No, no...
s09_e06_c13_u230	...kiss him?
s09_e06_c13_u231	Oh, well, yeah...
s09_e06_c13_u232	Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella. (he points at Mike)
s09_e06_c13_u233	Don't point your finger at me.
s09_e06_c13_u234	Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
s09_e06_c13_u235	Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... (he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)
s09_e06_c13_u236	Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just go.
s09_e06_c13_u237	Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... (points at Mike) well, you just better watch out.
s09_e06_c13_u238	Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.
s09_e06_c13_u239	Oh, you're going to Minsk?
s09_e06_c13_u240	Well, I might.
s09_e06_c13_u241	Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.
s09_e06_c13_u242	Okay, well... guys?
s09_e06_c13_u243	Right... Goodbye Phoebe. (Makes a move to kiss her.)
s09_e06_c13_u244	Hey, what are you kidding me?
s09_e06_c13_u245	Right-o, right-o... (to Mike) Take good care of her. (and he leaves)
s09_e06_c13_u246	I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
s09_e06_c13_u247	It's never gonna happen again right?
s09_e06_c13_u248	Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door opens and David comes in again.)
s09_e06_c13_u249	I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number (gives Mike a business card) We'll uhm... we'll party up Vladnik style. (He leaves again)
s09_e06_c14_u250	Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
s09_e06_c14_u251	Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
s09_e06_c14_u252	Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)
s09_e06_c14_u253	(looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is in shock)
s09_e06_c14_u254	Who's up for puppets?
s09_e06_c14_u255	Me! I'm up for puppets!
s09_e06_c14_u256	Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
s09_e06_c14_u257	Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
s09_e06_c14_u258	Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. (He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that and kind of angrily says...)
s09_e06_c14_u259	I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" nod to Ross)
s09_e06_c14_u260	(shakes his head) Oh my God!
s09_e06_c14_u261	Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus... (Ross goes to the kitchen)
s09_e06_c15_u262	That was kind of rude!
s09_e06_c15_u263	Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
s09_e06_c15_u264	You know, he was just doing his job...
s09_e06_c15_u265	Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
s09_e06_c15_u266	Oh, come on Ross...
s09_e06_c15_u267	No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
s09_e06_c15_u268	(sighs) Oh... That's true.
s09_e06_c15_u269	Thank you!
s09_e06_c15_u270	Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)
s09_e06_c16_u271	(In a puppet voice) So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
s09_e06_c16_u272	(kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.
s09_e06_c17_u273	Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
s09_e06_c17_u274	Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
s09_e06_c17_u275	Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!
s09_e06_c17_u276	Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
s09_e06_c17_u277	I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)
s09_e06_c17_u278	Allright. See you later!
s09_e06_c17_u279	See ya! (he leaves the apartment)
s09_e06_c17_u280	(to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?
s09_e06_c17_u281	Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
s09_e06_c18_u282	Here goes...
s09_e06_c18_u283	I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits)
s09_e06_c18_u284	Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
s09_e06_c18_u285	(surprised) Oh...
s09_e06_c18_u286	Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
s09_e06_c18_u287	(from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!
s09_e06_c18_u288	I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
s09_e06_c18_u289	Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
s09_e06_c18_u290	(from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!
s09_e06_c18_u291	Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
s09_e06_c18_u292	No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
s09_e06_c18_u293	No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.
s09_e06_c18_u294	What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts his head)
s09_e06_c18_u295	You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
s09_e06_c18_u296	That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
s09_e06_c18_u297	Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
s09_e06_c18_u298	hmmm... (and shakes his head)
s09_e06_c18_u299	I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
s09_e06_c18_u300	(from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!
s09_e06_c18_u301	I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
s09_e06_c18_u302	That must have been hard.
s09_e06_c18_u303	It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
s09_e06_c18_u304	But you are a real boy!
s09_e06_c18_u305	I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
s09_e06_c18_u306	It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
s09_e06_c18_u307	Here come some more...
s09_e06_c19_u308	And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?
s09_e06_c19_u309	What kind?
s09_e06_c19_u310	A friend-ship...
s09_e06_c19_u311	Wow! You blow my mind...
s09_e06_c19_u312	Oh, I gotta go.
s09_e06_c19_u313	Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
s09_e06_c19_u314	Twenty bucks.
s09_e06_c19_u315	It's like the cheapest college ever.
s04_e13_c01_u001	Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
s04_e13_c01_u002	People can hear you.
s04_e13_c01_u003	I know!!
s04_e13_c01_u004	Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
s04_e13_c01_u005	Yeah.
s04_e13_c01_u006	Hi!
s04_e13_c01_u007	Hi!
s04_e13_c01_u008	That is one good looking man!
s04_e13_c01_u009	Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
s04_e13_c01_u010	Sooo, you've been doing this long?
s04_e13_c01_u011	No, you're my first. Put the money on the table.
s04_e13_c01_u012	Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice. (They start making out harder.)
s04_e13_c01_u013	Dude!
s04_e13_c01_u014	Is that an expensive blouse?
s04_e13_c01_u015	If you want it to be.
s04_e13_c01_u016	Here's your girlfriend's button. (Holding the button.)
s04_e13_c02_u017	Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
s04_e13_c02_u018	Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
s04_e13_c02_u019	Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
s04_e13_c02_u020	Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just-(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)-throw your purses at it.
s04_e13_c02_u021	Bloomingdale's eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)
s04_e13_c02_u022	Oh my God, are you out of a job?
s04_e13_c02_u023	No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
s04_e13_c02_u024	Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
s04_e13_c02_u025	Uh-huh.
s04_e13_c02_u026	That sounds great!
s04_e13_c02_u027	(entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)
s04_e13_c02_u028	Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
s04_e13_c02_u029	(Holding a turkey leg) There's gravy?
s04_e13_c02_u030	If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now. (She takes back the turkey leg)
s04_e13_c02_u031	What are you doing?
s04_e13_c02_u032	I think I left a donut up here.
s04_e13_c03_u033	Hey!
s04_e13_c03_u034	Hey!
s04_e13_c03_u035	Hey!
s04_e13_c03_u036	Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
s04_e13_c03_u037	Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy.
s04_e13_c03_u038	Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
s04_e13_c03_u039	That's a good idea for a business!
s04_e13_c03_u040	I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?" And she'll go, "No-no-no, it's Chandler." And he'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
s04_e13_c03_u041	(to Ross) That-that is a good trick.
s04_e13_c03_u042	All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
s04_e13_c03_u043	Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
s04_e13_c03_u044	Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
s04_e13_c03_u045	Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
s04_e13_c03_u046	Yeah.
s04_e13_c03_u047	Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
s04_e13_c03_u048	They're not a couple!
s04_e13_c03_u049	Oh-okay, I get the game now.
s04_e13_c03_u050	Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
s04_e13_c03_u051	Oh yeah!
s04_e13_c03_u052	Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
s04_e13_c03_u053	Really?
s04_e13_c03_u054	Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
s04_e13_c03_u055	No.
s04_e13_c03_u056	Noooo!!
s04_e13_c04_u057	So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
s04_e13_c04_u058	Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
s04_e13_c04_u059	Yeah, I know but
s04_e13_c04_u060	Oh no-no-no, I'm there.
s04_e13_c04_u061	(entering) Hey!
s04_e13_c04_u062	Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
s04_e13_c04_u063	You made pancakes?
s04_e13_c04_u064	Yep! Grab a plate.
s04_e13_c04_u065	Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.)
s04_e13_c04_u066	No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin' closer.
s04_e13_c04_u067	Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
s04_e13_c04_u068	Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
s04_e13_c04_u069	Oh yeah!
s04_e13_c04_u070	Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
s04_e13_c04_u071	Oh yeah, who's playing?
s04_e13_c04_u072	The players.
s04_e13_c04_u073	Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
s04_e13_c04_u074	(laughs) Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is.
s04_e13_c04_u075	All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
s04_e13_c04_u076	Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.)
s04_e13_c05_u077	(on the phone) Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! (Pause) I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.
s04_e13_c05_u078	In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
s04_e13_c05_u079	Hi!
s04_e13_c05_u080	Hi, I'm Joshua.
s04_e13_c05_u081	Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
s04_e13_c05_u082	Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife
s04_e13_c05_u083	Oh, I'm so sorry.
s04_e13_c05_u084	Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
s04_e13_c05_u085	Well, at least that's a great suit.
s04_e13_c05_u086	Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours.
s04_e13_c05_u087	Okay.
s04_e13_c05_u088	Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
s04_e13_c05_u089	No-no, that wasn't me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.
s04_e13_c05_u090	Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way. (Motions to the correct way.)
s04_e13_c05_u091	It's this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his butt.)
s04_e13_c06_u092	I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
s04_e13_c06_u093	All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
s04_e13_c06_u094	Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
s04_e13_c06_u095	Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be-y'know you.
s04_e13_c06_u096	Hey you guys!
s04_e13_c06_u097	Hey!
s04_e13_c06_u098	Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
s04_e13_c06_u099	Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)
s04_e13_c06_u100	Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
s04_e13_c06_u101	It's a good play, isn't it?
s04_e13_c06_u102	Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him.
s04_e13_c06_u103	Okay, I- (Walks away.)
s04_e13_c06_u104	Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
s04_e13_c06_u105	Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
s04_e13_c06_u106	Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
s04_e13_c06_u107	Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
s04_e13_c06_u108	Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
s04_e13_c06_u109	Well, you can understand, given how we started.
s04_e13_c06_u110	Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
s04_e13_c06_u111	Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!
s04_e13_c06_u112	I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
s04_e13_c06_u113	Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!
s04_e13_c07_u114	I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
s04_e13_c07_u115	Rachel has a new doll.
s04_e13_c07_u116	Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
s04_e13_c07_u117	Uh, hello!
s04_e13_c07_u118	Hi-e!!
s04_e13_c07_u119	Ooh, what do I smell?
s04_e13_c07_u120	I don't know, it smells good.
s04_e13_c07_u121	Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
s04_e13_c07_u122	Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)
s04_e13_c07_u123	Please, have some!
s04_e13_c07_u124	Oh, yumm!
s04_e13_c07_u125	Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
s04_e13_c07_u126	(Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!
s04_e13_c07_u127	Yeah, it's just something I picked up.
s04_e13_c07_u128	Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!!
s04_e13_c07_u129	What? What?
s04_e13_c07_u130	Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
s04_e13_c07_u131	Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
s04_e13_c07_u132	It's Joshua.
s04_e13_c07_u133	Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. Joey follows him)
s04_e13_c07_u134	Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
s04_e13_c07_u135	(getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but
s04_e13_c07_u136	No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!
s04_e13_c07_u137	Yeah, I don't need it.
s04_e13_c07_u138	People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
s04_e13_c07_u139	Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
s04_e13_c07_u140	I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
s04_e13_c07_u141	Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
s04_e13_c07_u142	Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
s04_e13_c07_u143	If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!
s04_e13_c07_u144	Yeah, that's true.
s04_e13_c07_u145	All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
s04_e13_c07_u146	Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
s04_e13_c07_u147	Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl's apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
s04_e13_c07_u148	What?!
s04_e13_c07_u149	So you were right?
s04_e13_c07_u150	I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! (Pause) I don't live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)
s04_e13_c07_u151	Chandler!
s04_e13_c07_u152	Chandler, what did she say?
s04_e13_c07_u153	Wait a minute.
s04_e13_c07_u154	Come here.
s04_e13_c07_u155	Are you sure?
s04_e13_c07_u156	Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's
s04_e13_c07_u157	Beefsteak Charlie's?
s04_e13_c07_u158	Yes! See you and I have always been like-(motions that they think the same.)
s04_e13_c08_u159	Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey's.) Oh, hey, do you need help with that?
s04_e13_c08_u160	Nah, I got it.
s04_e13_c08_u161	Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey's.)
s04_e13_c08_u162	Hi!
s04_e13_c08_u163	Hey!
s04_e13_c08_u164	So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!
s04_e13_c08_u165	Why don't you ask him out?
s04_e13_c08_u166	Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!
s04_e13_c08_u167	Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
s04_e13_c08_u168	Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on.
s04_e13_c08_u169	He just got a divorce right?
s04_e13_c08_u170	Hmm-mmm.
s04_e13_c08_u171	So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
s04_e13_c08_u172	Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before.
s04_e13_c08_u173	(shocked) You've never asked a guy out?!!
s04_e13_c08_u174	No. Have you?
s04_e13_c08_u175	Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
s04_e13_c08_u176	I don't even know how I would go about it.
s04_e13_c08_u177	Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin'?"
s04_e13_c08_u178	Oh, please!
s04_e13_c08_u179	(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin'?
s04_e13_c08_u180	You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin'? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we-(Listens) the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You've done that a thousand times?
s04_e13_c08_u181	I've never done that.
s04_e13_c08_u182	Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
s04_e13_c08_u183	Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!
s04_e13_c08_u184	Really?! You think that will work?
s04_e13_c08_u185	Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
s04_e13_c08_u186	What the heck is that?
s04_e13_c09_u187	Did she call?
s04_e13_c09_u188	No, sorry.
s04_e13_c09_u189	All right, maybe I should call her.
s04_e13_c09_u190	No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!
s04_e13_c09_u191	He's right, what she did was unforgivable.
s04_e13_c09_u192	Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
s04_e13_c09_u193	How might you be wrong?
s04_e13_c09_u194	Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
s04_e13_c09_u195	Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
s04_e13_c09_u196	She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
s04_e13_c09_u197	That's all you're basing this on?
s04_e13_c09_u198	That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
s04_e13_c09_u199	Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
s04_e13_c09_u200	Oh my God!!
s04_e13_c10_u201	Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too- (Tries again.) Umm, who likes the Knicks-(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)
s04_e13_c10_u202	What do you think?
s04_e13_c10_u203	Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
s04_e13_c10_u204	Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the mirror.) Yeah?
s04_e13_c10_u205	Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?
s04_e13_c10_u206	I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
s04_e13_c10_u207	Great.
s04_e13_c10_u208	All right, thank you so much for all your help.
s04_e13_c10_u209	Sure.
s04_e13_c10_u210	Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
s04_e13_c10_u211	Yeah-eah-ha!
s04_e13_c10_u212	Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits.
s04_e13_c10_u213	Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!
s04_e13_c10_u214	Ah, that's okay, thanks.
s04_e13_c10_u215	Okay.
s04_e13_c10_u216	Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime. (He goes out the door.)
s04_e13_c10_u217	Basketball!
s04_e13_c10_u218	(coming back in) I'm sorry.
s04_e13_c10_u219	I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week.
s04_e13_c10_u220	Wow! That would be great.
s04_e13_c10_u221	Really?
s04_e13_c10_u222	Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr. Waltham returns.)
s04_e13_c10_u223	Good morning.
s04_e13_c10_u224	Hi!
s04_e13_c11_u225	(opening the door) Hey.
s04_e13_c11_u226	Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
s04_e13_c11_u227	Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
s04_e13_c11_u228	Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me-(Notices a pair of men's pants on the chair.) Nick's pants?
s04_e13_c11_u229	Yeah.
s04_e13_c11_u230	Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
s04_e13_c12_u231	Okay, for next time, what do you say?
s04_e13_c12_u232	I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
s04_e13_c12_u233	So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
s04_e13_c12_u234	He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!
s04_e13_c12_u235	(entering) Okay, it's ready. Come on.
s04_e13_c12_u236	What's ready?
s04_e13_c12_u237	Just come.
s04_e13_c12_u238	Oh my God!
s04_e13_c12_u239	Wow! Monica!
s04_e13_c12_u240	Great!
s04_e13_c12_u241	This is beautiful!
s04_e13_c12_u242	Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
s04_e13_c12_u243	Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
s04_e13_c12_u244	I don't know, it looks the same.
s04_e13_c12_u245	You used to have carpet.
s04_e13_c12_u246	Oh yeah!
s04_e13_c12_u247	So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
s04_e13_c12_u248	Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
s04_e13_c12_u249	Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess.
s04_e13_c12_u250	Hey!
s04_e13_c12_u251	How'd it go?
s04_e13_c12_u252	Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
s04_e13_c12_u253	Oh good!
s04_e13_c12_u254	She is now.
s04_e13_c12_u255	What are you saying?
s04_e13_c12_u256	I'm saying that she- is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
s04_e13_c12_u257	How? How is your fault?
s04_e13_c12_u258	Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
s04_e13_c12_u259	Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
s04_e13_c12_u260	Well, if-if she thought they were on a break
s04_e13_c13_u261	Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.
s04_e13_c13_u262	Really?
s04_e13_c13_u263	Will you call him?
s04_e13_c13_u264	Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?
s06_e17_c01_u001	Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
s06_e17_c01_u002	Yeah.
s06_e17_c01_u003	Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
s06_e17_c01_u004	(he's just picked up their bill) Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
s06_e17_c01_u005	Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
s06_e17_c01_u006	Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
s06_e17_c01_u007	I see where you're goin'!
s06_e17_c01_u008	What's up with the greed Joe?
s06_e17_c01_u009	All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two cause one of em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)
s06_e17_c01_u010	Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
s06_e17_c01_u011	Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it) goin' on. Wow! I still have it!
s06_e17_c01_u012	Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!
s06_e17_c01_u013	Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
s06_e17_c01_u014	(reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation.
s06_e17_c01_u015	No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
s06_e17_c01_u016	(approaching with a tray with an order on it) Joey!
s06_e17_c01_u017	Yeah?
s06_e17_c01_u018	What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
s06_e17_c01_u019	Uhh do it?
s06_e17_c01_u020	That guy (points) has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times! (He hands the coffee cup to Joey, assuming that Joey will deliver it and walks away.)
s06_e17_c01_u021	Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)
s06_e17_c02_u022	Hi!
s06_e17_c02_u023	Hey!
s06_e17_c02_u024	Hey, what have you guys been up to?
s06_e17_c02_u025	Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
s06_e17_c02_u026	Wow!
s06_e17_c02_u027	Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
s06_e17_c02_u028	Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)
s06_e17_c02_u029	Now, we can kick anybody's ass!
s06_e17_c02_u030	Yeah!
s06_e17_c02_u031	After one class? I don't think so.
s06_e17_c02_u032	What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
s06_e17_c02_u033	Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call (he holds two fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.
s06_e17_c02_u034	Isn't that a kind of sushi?
s06_e17_c02_u035	No, it's a concept!
s06_e17_c02_u036	Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
s06_e17_c02_u037	All right, maybe it means that too
s06_e17_c02_u038	Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
s06_e17_c02_u039	Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
s06_e17_c02_u040	(deadpan) Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
s06_e17_c02_u041	Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
s06_e17_c02_u042	You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
s06_e17_c02_u043	(moves closer) All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel's and screams) surprise!!
s06_e17_c02_u044	All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi. (Does the finger thing.)
s06_e17_c02_u045	(To Phoebe) Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
s06_e17_c02_u046	Y'know what- (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)
s06_e17_c02_u047	Hey-hey, is Monica here?
s06_e17_c02_u048	No.
s06_e17_c02_u049	No.
s06_e17_c02_u050	Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day.
s06_e17_c02_u051	Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!
s06_e17_c02_u052	(laughs) She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
s06_e17_c02_u053	Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
s06_e17_c02_u054	Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!
s06_e17_c02_u055	And of course, crotchless panties.
s06_e17_c02_u056	Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
s06_e17_c02_u057	Aw, I love that.
s06_e17_c02_u058	You guys!
s06_e17_c02_u059	You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut
s06_e17_c02_u060	(interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
s06_e17_c02_u061	Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
s06_e17_c02_u062	Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
s06_e17_c02_u063	I made a- (Does one of those gibberish words.)
s06_e17_c02_u064	What is that?
s06_e17_c02_u065	Nothing!
s06_e17_c02_u066	So what are you gonna do?
s06_e17_c02_u067	Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
s06_e17_c02_u068	Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She takes out a sock that's been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and two other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!
s06_e17_c02_u069	Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
s06_e17_c02_u070	Now, it's you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel's face and they both laugh.)
s06_e17_c03_u071	(admiring his work) This, this actually is a- (Does the same gibberish word from before.)
s06_e17_c03_u072	(entering) Hey!
s06_e17_c03_u073	Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
s06_e17_c03_u074	Oh, yeah.
s06_e17_c03_u075	Do we have to make the entire thing?
s06_e17_c03_u076	Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?
s06_e17_c03_u077	Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
s06_e17_c03_u078	Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
s06_e17_c03_u079	(sticking his head back in) What?
s06_e17_c03_u080	I'm just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does another sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!
s06_e17_c04_u081	(to the receptionist) Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids.
s06_e17_c04_u082	We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.
s06_e17_c04_u083	Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. (She just looks at him in horror.) Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
s06_e17_c04_u084	Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up. (Hands it to him.)
s06_e17_c04_u085	Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to one.)
s06_e17_c04_u086	Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.
s06_e17_c04_u087	But it's $2,000.
s06_e17_c04_u088	Sorry.
s06_e17_c04_u089	Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
s06_e17_c04_u090	We already got the results back on that on, and they're not good. (Joey beats a hasty retreat.)
s06_e17_c05_u091	DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
s06_e17_c05_u092	Ross!!!
s06_e17_c05_u093	What the hell was that?!
s06_e17_c05_u094	A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing every time now.)
s06_e17_c05_u095	Ohh, you're a freak!!
s06_e17_c05_u096	Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
s06_e17_c05_u097	All right, so we weren't prepared!
s06_e17_c05_u098	I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage and Ross screams-) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.) Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
s06_e17_c06_u099	(in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to reveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back at his script.)
s06_e17_c07_u100	Hey.
s06_e17_c07_u101	(not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.
s06_e17_c07_u102	What?!
s06_e17_c07_u103	Unagi. I'm always aware.
s06_e17_c07_u104	Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?
s06_e17_c07_u105	What's up?
s06_e17_c07_u106	I can't figure out what to make Monica.
s06_e17_c07_u107	Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes.
s06_e17_c07_u108	I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
s06_e17_c07_u109	Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. (Picks up a model of the Saturn V rocket, that's the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
s06_e17_c07_u110	Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
s06_e17_c07_u111	Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)
s06_e17_c07_u112	Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.
s06_e17_c07_u113	Why not?
s06_e17_c07_u114	Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
s06_e17_c07_u115	Oh.
s06_e17_c07_u116	Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)
s06_e17_c08_u117	Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way, and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then he holds it out as if he's giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) I can't do it. I can't do it. (He throws them both down and continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)
s06_e17_c08_u118	Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
s06_e17_c08_u119	Sure! Okay, you go first.
s06_e17_c08_u120	Okay, come here! Come here.
s06_e17_c08_u121	Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the couch.)
s06_e17_c08_u122	Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
s06_e17_c08_u123	Okay.
s06_e17_c08_u124	But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
s06_e17_c08_u125	Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
s06_e17_c08_u126	(momentarily terrified) Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
s06_e17_c08_u127	Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
s06_e17_c08_u128	Okay!
s06_e17_c08_u129	Okay, you ready to open yours?
s06_e17_c08_u130	Yeah!
s06_e17_c08_u131	Okay.
s06_e17_c08_u132	It's a sock bunny.
s06_e17_c08_u133	Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
s06_e17_c08_u134	Not really.
s06_e17_c08_u135	Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about.
s06_e17_c08_u136	I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
s06_e17_c08_u137	No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!
s06_e17_c08_u138	Oh, it's okay. I don't
s06_e17_c08_u139	No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just- You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
s06_e17_c08_u140	(thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They both run into the bedroom.)
s06_e17_c09_u141	Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to young to have seen that!
s06_e17_c09_u142	Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
s06_e17_c09_u143	You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
s06_e17_c09_u144	We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)
s06_e17_c09_u145	Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
s06_e17_c09_u146	Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
s06_e17_c09_u147	You have done enough!
s06_e17_c09_u148	I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
s06_e17_c09_u149	No you don't-get it in black, not brown.
s06_e17_c09_u150	Oop, your cake is ready!
s06_e17_c09_u151	Oop!
s06_e17_c09_u152	Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
s06_e17_c09_u153	Hey Mon! Hey Chann! (He goes to the fridge) Just gettin' a soda! (Does so.)
s06_e17_c09_u154	Who the hell are you?!
s06_e17_c09_u155	I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!
s06_e17_c09_u156	(entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)
s06_e17_c09_u157	Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
s06_e17_c09_u158	Who the hell is Carl?!
s06_e17_c09_u159	Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
s06_e17_c09_u160	Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
s06_e17_c09_u161	Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is- (Does the international hand symbol for so-so.)
s06_e17_c09_u162	The only problem!
s06_e17_c09_u163	Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
s06_e17_c09_u164	(sticking his head back in) Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
s06_e17_c09_u165	(to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)
s06_e17_c10_u166	Pat Sajak?
s06_e17_c10_u167	Yep!
s06_e17_c10_u168	Alex Trebek?
s06_e17_c10_u169	Oh, of course!
s06_e17_c10_u170	Chuck Woolery?
s06_e17_c10_u171	Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who's ass I cannot kick.
s06_e17_c10_u172	Say it!
s06_e17_c10_u173	Say we are unagi!
s06_e17_c10_u174	It's not something you are! It's something you have!
s06_e17_c10_u175	Say it!
s06_e17_c10_u176	Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
s06_e17_c11_u177	All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
s06_e17_c11_u178	Another Minute Maid fiasco.
s06_e17_c11_u179	That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
s06_e17_c11_u180	Well, I'm not gonna talk because
s06_e17_c11_u181	(gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey silences him with a grunt.)
s06_e17_c11_u182	(entering) (To the receptionist) Can I have the next one please? (Takes the form.) Joey and Tony Tribbiani. (Joey and Carl stand up.)
s06_e17_c11_u183	That's us.
s06_e17_c11_u184	(seeing they're not identical) But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
s06_e17_c11_u185	That's right, $2,000.
s06_e17_c11_u186	But, you're not identical twins.
s06_e17_c11_u187	Damnit Carl!
s06_e17_c12_u188	Oh my good God.
s06_e17_c12_u189	Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
s06_e17_c12_u190	Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
s06_e17_c12_u191	I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
s06_e17_c12_u192	Oh, the mixed tape.
s06_e17_c12_u193	The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
s06_e17_c12_u194	You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.)
s06_e17_c12_u195	No! You're the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)
s06_e17_c13_u196	Okay ladies, that ends today's class, and let's remember, let's be safe out there.
s06_e17_c13_u197	It's a great class.
s06_e17_c13_u198	Thanks.
s06_e17_c13_u199	Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.) Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
s06_e17_c13_u200	Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them
s06_e17_c13_u201	No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
s06_e17_c13_u202	Who? Me the attacker?
s06_e17_c13_u203	Yes that's right.
s06_e17_c13_u204	Why?
s06_e17_c13_u205	I tired attacking two women, did not work.
s06_e17_c13_u206	What?!
s06_e17_c13_u207	No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
s06_e17_c13_u208	Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
s06_e17_c13_u209	Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that's a no.
s06_e17_c14_u210	I am so, so, so, so sorry!
s06_e17_c14_u211	(not buying it) Uh-huh.
s06_e17_c14_u212	And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)
s06_e17_c14_u213	(pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom) And, are you kiddin' me?!
s06_e17_c14_u214	Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?
s06_e17_c14_u215	Okay.
s06_e17_c14_u216	Okay. (They hug.)
s06_e17_c14_u217	So, are we going in there?
s06_e17_c14_u218	I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.)
s06_e17_c15_u219	Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)
s06_e17_c15_u220	I don't like sitting up here! I'm just gonna over- (She starts to get up.)
s06_e17_c15_u221	(stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!
s06_e17_c15_u222	Why is Ross doing that?
s06_e17_c15_u223	DANGER!!!!
s06_e17_c15_u224	Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
s06_e17_c15_u225	We should help him!
s06_e17_c15_u226	I- Well, I don't think they need any help.
s04_e08_c01_u001	(answering phone) Hello.
s04_e08_c01_u002	(on phone) Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I- (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)
s04_e08_c01_u003	(answering phone) Hello.
s04_e08_c01_u004	Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm- (Joey hangs up the phone again.)
s04_e08_c01_u005	(answering phone) Stop callin'!!
s04_e08_c01_u006	(on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
s04_e08_c01_u007	All right!
s04_e08_c01_u008	What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything- (Joey realizes it's Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)
s04_e08_c02_u009	(entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
s04_e08_c02_u010	Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
s04_e08_c02_u011	So are things with you and Joey any better?
s04_e08_c02_u012	They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
s04_e08_c02_u013	Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
s04_e08_c02_u014	Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
s04_e08_c02_u015	You shouldn't.
s04_e08_c02_u016	Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
s04_e08_c02_u017	Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don't know why I do that.
s04_e08_c02_u018	Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
s04_e08_c02_u019	We haven't eaten yet!
s04_e08_c02_u020	I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just- (goes into her bedroom.)
s04_e08_c02_u021	Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, cause I wanna trade for her.
s04_e08_c02_u022	I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
s04_e08_c02_u023	Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
s04_e08_c02_u024	Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
s04_e08_c02_u025	Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it- (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe's faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it- (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials
s04_e08_c02_u026	Ohh.
s04_e08_c02_u027	Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
s04_e08_c02_u028	Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
s04_e08_c02_u029	Who cares? He works in a museum!
s04_e08_c02_u030	Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
s04_e08_c02_u031	You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
s04_e08_c02_u032	Thanks.
s04_e08_c02_u033	What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!
s04_e08_c02_u034	God, what happened?!
s04_e08_c02_u035	Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
s04_e08_c02_u036	(standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!
s04_e08_c02_u037	Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
s04_e08_c02_u038	Open it up, let me see.
s04_e08_c02_u039	Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
s04_e08_c02_u040	Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
s04_e08_c02_u041	Ooh, God it looks bad.
s04_e08_c02_u042	Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
s04_e08_c02_u043	No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
s04_e08_c02_u044	He's really picky about his patients.
s04_e08_c02_u045	Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
s04_e08_c02_u046	Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.
s04_e08_c02_u047	(on phone) Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
s04_e08_c02_u048	Yes!!
s04_e08_c02_u049	Yes! She's very excited about that.
s04_e08_c02_u050	This is so cool, til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)
s04_e08_c02_u051	Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
s04_e08_c02_u052	Okay, get out of my kitchen!
s04_e08_c02_u053	(entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
s04_e08_c02_u054	All right I- I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
s04_e08_c02_u055	So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
s04_e08_c02_u056	Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
s04_e08_c02_u057	Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
s04_e08_c02_u058	I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
s04_e08_c02_u059	Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
s04_e08_c02_u060	Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
s04_e08_c02_u061	Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
s04_e08_c02_u062	Like?
s04_e08_c02_u063	Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
s04_e08_c02_u064	When was the last time you saw her wear it?
s04_e08_c02_u065	Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh
s04_e08_c02_u066	Big dog?
s04_e08_c03_u067	(entering) Hey!
s04_e08_c03_u068	Hey!
s04_e08_c03_u069	What are you doing?
s04_e08_c03_u070	I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
s04_e08_c03_u071	Everything? Even the TV?
s04_e08_c03_u072	No! I'm putting that in my room.
s04_e08_c03_u073	Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
s04_e08_c03_u074	Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
s04_e08_c03_u075	That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
s04_e08_c03_u076	Five years.
s04_e08_c03_u077	You've sentenced him?!
s04_e08_c03_u078	Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
s04_e08_c03_u079	Joey, the guy's your best friend.
s04_e08_c03_u080	No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
s04_e08_c03_u081	Oh, who? Me?
s04_e08_c03_u082	Yeah!
s04_e08_c03_u083	Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
s04_e08_c03_u084	What?
s04_e08_c03_u085	I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
s04_e08_c03_u086	All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
s04_e08_c04_u087	I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
s04_e08_c04_u088	(entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
s04_e08_c04_u089	Hey Joe.
s04_e08_c04_u090	(Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)
s04_e08_c05_u091	I'll be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy.
s04_e08_c05_u092	Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
s04_e08_c05_u093	Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
s04_e08_c05_u094	Dr. Burke will see you know.
s04_e08_c05_u095	Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
s04_e08_c05_u096	Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
s04_e08_c05_u097	Ready?
s04_e08_c06_u098	Hey! I'm sorry! That-(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?
s04_e08_c06_u099	My folks.
s04_e08_c06_u100	Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
s04_e08_c06_u101	I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
s04_e08_c06_u102	What?!
s04_e08_c06_u103	Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I
s04_e08_c06_u104	Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
s04_e08_c06_u105	Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)
s04_e08_c06_u106	Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
s04_e08_c06_u107	Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
s04_e08_c06_u108	All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
s04_e08_c06_u109	When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
s04_e08_c06_u110	What?
s04_e08_c06_u111	Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
s04_e08_c06_u112	All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?
s04_e08_c06_u113	We've got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)
s04_e08_c07_u114	Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
s04_e08_c07_u115	I was probably waiting for it to open.
s04_e08_c07_u116	I gotta tell you, you look great now.
s04_e08_c07_u117	You look great too.
s04_e08_c07_u118	You're an excellent patient!
s04_e08_c07_u119	So how does it look?
s04_e08_c07_u120	Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
s04_e08_c07_u121	Like a pirate?!
s04_e08_c07_u122	If that helps you.
s04_e08_c07_u123	Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.
s04_e08_c07_u124	I moved back here a couple of months ago.
s04_e08_c07_u125	Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
s04_e08_c07_u126	Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)
s04_e08_c07_u127	No way!
s04_e08_c07_u128	I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
s04_e08_c07_u129	(disappointed) Oh.
s04_e08_c07_u130	But we broke up.
s04_e08_c07_u131	(happy) Oh.
s04_e08_c07_u132	She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
s04_e08_c07_u133	(sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate's voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
s04_e08_c07_u134	You're not wearing the patch yet.
s04_e08_c07_u135	I know.
s04_e08_c08_u136	He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
s04_e08_c08_u137	I know, it's sick.
s04_e08_c08_u138	Why is it sick?
s04_e08_c08_u139	Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
s04_e08_c08_u140	Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
s04_e08_c08_u141	Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
s04_e08_c08_u142	Yeah.
s04_e08_c08_u143	(coming out of the bathroom) What's twisted?
s04_e08_c08_u144	Me going out with Richard's son.
s04_e08_c08_u145	Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
s04_e08_c08_u146	(He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
s04_e08_c08_u147	Is he okay in there?
s04_e08_c08_u148	He's fine!
s04_e08_c08_u149	Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
s04_e08_c08_u150	Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livin' in a box!! (goes to her room)
s04_e08_c08_u151	So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
s04_e08_c08_u152	Chandler?
s04_e08_c08_u153	The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!
s04_e08_c08_u154	(to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
s04_e08_c08_u155	(worried) Why?
s04_e08_c08_u156	I just wanna check something.
s04_e08_c08_u157	Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)
s04_e08_c08_u158	(He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we'll see.
s04_e08_c08_u159	Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
s04_e08_c08_u160	(coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
s04_e08_c08_u161	(grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
s04_e08_c08_u162	Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
s04_e08_c08_u163	Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
s04_e08_c08_u164	Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
s04_e08_c08_u165	What did you get?
s04_e08_c08_u166	Credit.
s04_e08_c08_u167	(running in from her bedroom) I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.
s04_e08_c08_u168	Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)
s04_e08_c08_u169	Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
s04_e08_c08_u170	Hi, nice to meet you.
s04_e08_c08_u171	And Joey.
s04_e08_c08_u172	Hey!
s04_e08_c08_u173	Hi, Joey.
s04_e08_c08_u174	My brother, Ross.
s04_e08_c08_u175	Hey.
s04_e08_c08_u176	And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that's Chandler.
s04_e08_c08_u177	How do ya do.
s04_e08_c08_u178	What's
s04_e08_c08_u179	Umm, well, he's
s04_e08_c08_u180	He's doin' some thinkin'!
s04_e08_c08_u181	What happened? What happened?!
s04_e08_c08_u182	You kissed my girlfriend!
s04_e08_c08_u183	Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
s04_e08_c08_u184	Like em, like em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like em?
s04_e08_c08_u185	(Swears in Italian, it's the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)
s04_e08_c08_u186	All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
s04_e08_c08_u187	Where can I wash up?
s04_e08_c08_u188	Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
s04_e08_c08_u189	Thank you.
s04_e08_c08_u190	Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
s04_e08_c08_u191	See he's nice. Right?
s04_e08_c08_u192	Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
s04_e08_c08_u193	Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
s04_e08_c08_u194	I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)
s04_e08_c08_u195	(pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.
s04_e08_c08_u196	Oh, I'll get it. (goes over to the door.)
s04_e08_c08_u197	Gotcha! (laughs)
s04_e08_c08_u198	That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
s04_e08_c08_u199	Sorry!
s04_e08_c08_u200	Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
s04_e08_c08_u201	Okay, okay, you got it!
s04_e08_c08_u202	Ross, can you pass me the yams?
s04_e08_c08_u203	Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
s04_e08_c08_u204	Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
s04_e08_c08_u205	Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
s04_e08_c08_u206	There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
s04_e08_c08_u207	Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)
s04_e08_c08_u208	You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
s04_e08_c08_u209	All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
s04_e08_c08_u210	You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
s04_e08_c08_u211	So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
s04_e08_c08_u212	Absolutely!
s04_e08_c08_u213	That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There's no response from Chandler.) Okay.
s04_e08_c08_u214	Don't say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what's in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we- were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
s04_e08_c08_u215	I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
s04_e08_c08_u216	(putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)
s04_e08_c08_u217	Here, let me help. (Does so.)
s04_e08_c08_u218	Thank you.
s04_e08_c08_u219	You-you have a very beautiful- eye.
s04_e08_c08_u220	Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
s04_e08_c08_u221	Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
s04_e08_c08_u222	I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
s04_e08_c08_u223	Oh, I totally agree.
s04_e08_c08_u224	We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
s04_e08_c08_u225	What?
s04_e08_c08_u226	Nothing. Nothing.
s04_e08_c08_u227	No-no really, was-was that not okay?
s04_e08_c08_u228	No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss
s04_e08_c08_u229	Oh my God! It didn't remind you of
s04_e08_c08_u230	(interrupting) Don't say it!
s04_e08_c08_u231	No, but it did! Didn't it?!
s04_e08_c08_u232	Yeah!
s04_e08_c08_u233	Oh man!!
s04_e08_c08_u234	I know!
s04_e08_c08_u235	I'll get it. (It's Kathy.)
s04_e08_c08_u236	Hey.
s04_e08_c08_u237	That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
s04_e08_c08_u238	In the box.
s04_e08_c08_u239	Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
s04_e08_c08_u240	He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
s04_e08_c08_u241	Joey, had reasons.
s04_e08_c08_u242	They were threefold.
s04_e08_c08_u243	(starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)
s04_e08_c08_u244	What?!
s04_e08_c08_u245	He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!
s04_e08_c08_u246	So?
s04_e08_c08_u247	Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
s04_e08_c08_u248	Yeah?
s04_e08_c08_u249	Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
s04_e08_c08_u250	Man, this is
s04_e08_c08_u251	Now go! Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)
s04_e08_c08_u252	All right, who got Chandler? Cause I uh, need to trade.
s04_e08_c09_u253	Oh, he sees her!
s04_e08_c09_u254	Oh, he's catching up to her!
s04_e08_c09_u255	Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
s04_e08_c09_u256	He's taking her purse!
s04_e08_c09_u257	Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
s04_e08_c09_u258	Oh, there they are!
s04_e08_c09_u259	All right, get a room.
s08_e03_c01_u001	Hey! Babe! Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
s08_e03_c01_u002	Yeah I am!
s08_e03_c01_u003	(singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
s08_e03_c01_u004	That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.
s08_e03_c01_u005	(entering with Phoebe) Hey!
s08_e03_c01_u006	Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
s08_e03_c01_u007	I'd better go pack.
s08_e03_c01_u008	Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find though was your Speedo.
s08_e03_c01_u009	A Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo. I'm gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)
s08_e03_c01_u010	(entering) Oh good you're still here!
s08_e03_c01_u011	Hey!
s08_e03_c01_u012	I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.)
s08_e03_c01_u013	Thank you.
s08_e03_c01_u014	And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. (They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?
s08_e03_c01_u015	We know its Ross!
s08_e03_c01_u016	How?! How do you know?
s08_e03_c01_u017	It was his sweater, but-Oh my God!
s08_e03_c01_u018	Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I'm so relieved you guys know.
s08_e03_c01_u019	This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
s08_e03_c01_u020	I know! (They hug.)
s08_e03_c01_u021	Me too! (Joins the hug.)
s08_e03_c01_u022	I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here! (He joins the hug.)
s08_e03_c01_u023	(breaking the hug) You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
s08_e03_c01_u024	Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
s08_e03_c01_u025	Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I'm gonna tell Ross!
s08_e03_c01_u026	Well, what were you gonna say?
s08_e03_c01_u027	Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
s08_e03_c01_u028	Well that, that sounds good.
s08_e03_c01_u029	Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)
s08_e03_c01_u030	Hey! Good luck!
s08_e03_c01_u031	Yeah, bye.
s08_e03_c01_u032	Bye.
s08_e03_c01_u033	(entering) Hey, what was that all about?
s08_e03_c01_u034	Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
s08_e03_c01_u035	(in a high pitched voice) What?! I didn't even know that-Why didn't you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!
s08_e03_c01_u036	I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
s08_e03_c01_u037	(in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
s08_e03_c01_u038	What secrets?
s08_e03_c01_u039	Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
s08_e03_c01_u040	(whispering to Chandler) You'll tell me later?
s08_e03_c01_u041	You already know.
s08_e03_c02_u042	Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
s08_e03_c02_u043	Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
s08_e03_c02_u044	All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
s08_e03_c02_u045	I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.
s08_e03_c02_u046	What?! They took mine to give to you!
s08_e03_c02_u047	Why would they take away our keys?
s08_e03_c02_u048	Maybe they don't trust us.
s08_e03_c02_u049	No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
s08_e03_c02_u050	You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
s08_e03_c02_u051	Hey, I washed those!
s08_e03_c02_u052	No you didn't.
s08_e03_c02_u053	Yeah that didn't sound like me.
s08_e03_c02_u054	Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
s08_e03_c02_u055	Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
s08_e03_c02_u056	What stuff?
s08_e03_c02_u057	Monica's chicken parm! I'll take care of it. (He picks up the phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)
s08_e03_c02_u058	(entering) Hey!
s08_e03_c02_u059	Did Rachel find you?
s08_e03_c02_u060	No why?
s08_e03_c02_u061	Oh she was looking for you.
s08_e03_c02_u062	Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
s08_e03_c02_u063	Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
s08_e03_c02_u064	Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
s08_e03_c02_u065	Oh no.
s08_e03_c02_u066	What?
s08_e03_c02_u067	I think I might know what this is about.
s08_e03_c02_u068	Really?
s08_e03_c02_u069	Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
s08_e03_c02_u070	(deadpan) And?
s08_e03_c02_u071	Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
s08_e03_c02_u072	Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!
s08_e03_c02_u073	Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
s08_e03_c02_u074	Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
s08_e03_c02_u075	Why? What-what else could it be?
s08_e03_c02_u076	Oh wow, I don't feel well.
s08_e03_c02_u077	I'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
s08_e03_c02_u078	(To Joey) Maybe it's something you ate?
s08_e03_c02_u079	Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
s08_e03_c02_u080	Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y'know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)
s08_e03_c03_u081	Next?
s08_e03_c03_u082	They're kissing let's just go around them.
s08_e03_c03_u083	Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love.
s08_e03_c03_u084	I'm in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
s08_e03_c03_u085	Next?
s08_e03_c03_u086	(to the couple) Hi! Can you do that and walk? Cause she said, "Next."
s08_e03_c03_u087	Sorry. We didn't hear you; we're on our honeymoon.
s08_e03_c03_u088	Oh, let me see what I can do. (Checks the computer) There are some first class seats available.
s08_e03_c03_u089	(To Chandler) Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
s08_e03_c03_u090	We are on our honeymoon.
s08_e03_c03_u091	Grab my ass!
s08_e03_c03_u092	Next?
s08_e03_c03_u093	Hi, sorry. I almost didn't hear you, because y'know I'm just so in love with my new husband. We're on our honeymoon.
s08_e03_c03_u094	Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you'll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you'll be in 25K.
s08_e03_c03_u095	Oh no, you see we're on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
s08_e03_c03_u096	I'm sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.
s08_e03_c03_u097	You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, we-She would've given us those tickets. Damnit!
s08_e03_c03_u098	25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
s08_e03_c04_u099	I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
s08_e03_c04_u100	Of course I do! And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.
s08_e03_c04_u101	What the hell is that?
s08_e03_c04_u102	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
s08_e03_c04_u103	You said there was a gas leak in here.
s08_e03_c04_u104	Well why don't you use your key?
s08_e03_c04_u105	Because by the time I find it on this thing (Holds up a huge key ring with a thousand keys on it), the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. (To the fireman) Come on! Hurry up.
s08_e03_c04_u106	Oh! We could have done that.
s08_e03_c05_u107	Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
s08_e03_c05_u108	No.
s08_e03_c05_u109	Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler in tow.)
s08_e03_c05_u110	Just act like you belong.
s08_e03_c05_u111	Oh my God! Oranges!
s08_e03_c05_u112	Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)
s08_e03_c05_u113	Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
s08_e03_c05_u114	Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)
s08_e03_c05_u115	I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.
s08_e03_c05_u116	Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.
s08_e03_c05_u117	(grabbing the ticket from him) Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.
s08_e03_c05_u118	Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)
s08_e03_c05_u119	Sir! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
s08_e03_c05_u120	Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before she exits.) Go! Go! Go!
s08_e03_c06_u121	(seeing him) Hi!
s08_e03_c06_u122	Hi.
s08_e03_c06_u123	Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
s08_e03_c06_u124	(quietly confident) I think we do. Why don't we go inside? (They go inside.) Look uh, I know why you're here.
s08_e03_c06_u125	You do?
s08_e03_c06_u126	Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
s08_e03_c06_u127	(warily) Okay.
s08_e03_c06_u128	Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
s08_e03_c06_u129	(confused) What?
s08_e03_c06_u130	I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and-and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?
s08_e03_c06_u131	Seriously. What?!
s08_e03_c06_u132	Okay. Okay. Y'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
s08_e03_c06_u133	Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?
s08_e03_c06_u134	Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
s08_e03_c06_u135	(touches his knee) I'm pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is staring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay, whenever you're ready. (Sits back and opens her magazine.) And you're the father by the way-but you got that
s08_e03_c07_u136	(closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?
s08_e03_c07_u137	I'm good. I'm good.
s08_e03_c07_u138	Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. (Ross nods.)
s08_e03_c07_u139	Yeah, I need uh- I'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
s08_e03_c07_u140	I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
s08_e03_c07_u141	What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
s08_e03_c07_u142	They do!
s08_e03_c07_u143	No they don't!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
s08_e03_c07_u144	Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
s08_e03_c07_u145	Oh well I may as well have!
s08_e03_c07_u146	Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out
s08_e03_c07_u147	Freaked out? Hey no, I'm not freaked out! I'm indignant! As a consumer!
s08_e03_c07_u148	Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later.
s08_e03_c07_u149	No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I-In fact, (picks up the phone) I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
s08_e03_c07_u150	Okay, y'know maybe I should come back- (Starts to leave.)
s08_e03_c07_u151	(grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!
s08_e03_c07_u152	(stops) Okay.
s08_e03_c07_u153	(on phone) Yeah I'll press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to escape.)
s08_e03_c08_u154	I've looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
s08_e03_c08_u155	(eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)
s08_e03_c08_u156	Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door.
s08_e03_c08_u157	Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
s08_e03_c08_u158	Well I'm gonna have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway.
s08_e03_c08_u159	Oh no.
s08_e03_c08_u160	(measures the top of the doorframe) Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I'll have to cancel my yoga class. (Ross walks up.) Hey Ross!
s08_e03_c08_u161	Hi.
s08_e03_c08_u162	Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?
s08_e03_c08_u163	Sure.
s08_e03_c08_u164	Namaste. (Bows.)
s08_e03_c08_u165	Namaste. (Bows.)
s08_e03_c08_u166	Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
s08_e03_c08_u167	So it's noticeable huh?
s08_e03_c08_u168	Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
s08_e03_c08_u169	Didn't you two already talk?
s08_e03_c08_u170	Yeah but uh- Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there's something else. (Pause) Rachel's pregnant.
s08_e03_c08_u171	(simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can't believe that!!
s08_e03_c08_u172	(simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!
s08_e03_c08_u173	With my child.
s08_e03_c08_u174	That is brand new information!!
s08_e03_c08_u175	You already know don't you?
s08_e03_c08_u176	A little bit.
s08_e03_c08_u177	How are you doing?
s08_e03_c08_u178	Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
s08_e03_c08_u179	Well, what did you say to her?
s08_e03_c08_u180	Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
s08_e03_c08_u181	Oh Ross.
s08_e03_c08_u182	But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
s08_e03_c08_u183	(shocked) What?
s08_e03_c08_u184	I gotta go find her.
s08_e03_c08_u185	Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
s08_e03_c08_u186	Evidently they do.
s08_e03_c08_u187	What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)
s08_e03_c09_u188	I can't believe we're here.
s08_e03_c09_u189	Oh you've got to be kidding me.
s08_e03_c09_u190	What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)
s08_e03_c09_u191	As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
s08_e03_c09_u192	No!! You have been screwing us all day!
s08_e03_c09_u193	Who are you?
s08_e03_c09_u194	We're you just ten seconds later!
s08_e03_c09_u195	Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
s08_e03_c09_u196	Well you can have the suite if you want. We don't care about where we stay. We're here to celebrate our love together. We don't have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
s08_e03_c09_u197	(looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
s08_e03_c10_u198	Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment.
s08_e03_c10_u199	What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!
s08_e03_c10_u200	What else is new?
s08_e03_c10_u201	Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys.
s08_e03_c10_u202	Well do something! Get in there!
s08_e03_c10_u203	How? I guess I could break down your door.
s08_e03_c10_u204	Yeah! Do that!
s08_e03_c10_u205	And-and you won't blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs up.)
s08_e03_c10_u206	No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
s08_e03_c10_u207	Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down. (He hands the phone to Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)
s08_e03_c10_u208	Oh hey hi, he's doing it. He's breaking down the door. (The chair breaks in half.) Okay, we're in. (She hangs up the phone.)
s08_e03_c11_u209	Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
s08_e03_c11_u210	(sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?
s08_e03_c11_u211	The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
s08_e03_c11_u212	Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn
s08_e03_c11_u213	Hi!
s08_e03_c11_u214	(shocked) Hi!
s08_e03_c11_u215	Uh we-we need to talk.
s08_e03_c11_u216	Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
s08_e03_c11_u217	Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
s08_e03_c11_u218	Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?
s08_e03_c11_u219	What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I'm sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards Rachel's feet) really-I should have been thinking about you Rach
s08_e03_c11_u220	Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
s08_e03_c11_u221	Right! Right! I just-I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that til after we get married.
s08_e03_c11_u222	What married?
s08_e03_c11_u223	Well yeah, I think we should get married.
s08_e03_c11_u224	What, because that's your answer to everything?
s08_e03_c11_u225	No, because that's the right thing to do.
s08_e03_c11_u226	Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
s08_e03_c11_u227	No but-but still you can't possibly do this alone.
s08_e03_c11_u228	Excuse me?
s08_e03_c11_u229	Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
s08_e03_c11_u230	What?!
s08_e03_c11_u231	I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
s08_e03_c11_u232	I can too eat by myself!
s08_e03_c11_u233	When have you ever?
s08_e03_c11_u234	When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
s08_e03_c11_u235	Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
s08_e03_c11_u236	Oh please, you inhale your food!
s08_e03_c11_u237	I grew up with Monica! If you didn't eat fast you didn't eat!!
s08_e03_c11_u238	(entering) Am I interrupting?
s08_e03_c11_u239	Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
s08_e03_c11_u240	But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
s08_e03_c11_u241	Huh. Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
s08_e03_c11_u242	(To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
s08_e03_c11_u243	I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
s08_e03_c11_u244	Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. (We see Ross and Rachel looking at the screen.) Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
s08_e03_c11_u245	Oh my God.
s08_e03_c11_u246	Wow. There it is, I see it.
s08_e03_c11_u247	Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.
s08_e03_c11_u248	Okay.
s08_e03_c11_u249	Thank you.
s08_e03_c11_u250	Pretty amazing huh?
s08_e03_c11_u251	I don't see it!
s08_e03_c11_u252	What? What?!
s08_e03_c11_u253	I can't see it!
s08_e03_c11_u254	You-you just said that you did!
s08_e03_c11_u255	I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!
s08_e03_c11_u256	Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, (rolls the machine closer) it's-it's-it's, it's right there (Points).
s08_e03_c11_u257	Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now.
s08_e03_c11_u258	Do you really?
s08_e03_c11_u259	No, I don't see it!
s08_e03_c11_u260	Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
s08_e03_c11_u261	Yeah.
s08_e03_c11_u262	Sweetie that's it.
s08_e03_c11_u263	That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
s08_e03_c11_u264	You're welcome.
s08_e03_c11_u265	Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.
s08_e03_c11_u266	Yeah, that's our baby.
s08_e03_c12_u267	Hi.
s08_e03_c12_u268	Hey!
s08_e03_c12_u269	Hey! So how was the doctor?
s08_e03_c12_u270	Oh, everything went great.
s08_e03_c12_u271	Good.
s08_e03_c12_u272	Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
s08_e03_c12_u273	Oh.
s08_e03_c12_u274	I don't see the baby. Where is it?
s08_e03_c12_u275	Oh no, I know I couldn't see it either at first, but it's right umm- (Starts to cry) Ross, I lost it again.
s08_e03_c12_u276	Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
s08_e14_c01_u001	(opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on) Hey, what's up?
s08_e14_c01_u002	Well, I left my guitar here again.
s08_e14_c01_u003	Oh, okay. No problem.
s08_e14_c01_u004	Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)
s08_e14_c01_u005	Okay.
s08_e14_c01_u006	Oh.
s08_e14_c01_u007	Here you go.
s08_e14_c01_u008	Okay.
s08_e14_c01_u009	Okay.
s08_e14_c01_u010	Great! Umm-(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.)
s08_e14_c01_u011	What?!
s08_e14_c01_u012	So do you want to hang out or something?
s08_e14_c01_u013	Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
s08_e14_c01_u014	Oh are you and Chandler
s08_e14_c01_u015	Yes! Exactly.
s08_e14_c01_u016	Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
s08_e14_c01_u017	(laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)
s08_e14_c01_u018	Hey Pheebs, what's up?
s08_e14_c01_u019	You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
s08_e14_c01_u020	Oh my God! You're getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
s08_e14_c01_u021	Phoebe, I can explain!
s08_e14_c01_u022	You told me you hate massages!
s08_e14_c01_u023	Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning-Don't let Phoebe in.
s08_e14_c01_u024	I can't believe this! How long as this been going on?
s08_e14_c01_u025	Well umm, Alexandra has been
s08_e14_c01_u026	Oh, it has a name?
s08_e14_c01_u027	Phoebe, don't get upset!
s08_e14_c01_u028	Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go! (She storms out.)
s08_e14_c01_u029	Well, Phoebe I thought I'd-(Off Phoebe's look)-Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)
s08_e14_c02_u030	Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!
s08_e14_c02_u031	Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much.
s08_e14_c02_u032	Oh, I love you too.
s08_e14_c02_u033	And I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this but, you're the best sex I ever had.
s08_e14_c02_u034	That's always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!
s08_e14_c02_u035	Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
s08_e14_c02_u036	(crying) I hope you're a better father than you're a friend!! (Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)
s08_e14_c02_u037	(bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!
s08_e14_c02_u038	What? What's going on?
s08_e14_c02_u039	Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
s08_e14_c02_u040	Aaaah
s08_e14_c02_u041	Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
s08_e14_c02_u042	Really?!
s08_e14_c02_u043	Yes!
s08_e14_c02_u044	Oh, y'know what? Maybe uh, you-you should come to me. I'm a not, I'm not wearing any bottoms.
s08_e14_c02_u045	Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
s08_e14_c02_u046	Oh my, oh my God!
s08_e14_c02_u047	Aw, it's unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she's like umm-oh-who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
s08_e14_c02_u048	Mia Hamm?
s08_e14_c02_u049	Mia Hamm!
s08_e14_c02_u050	Oh that's amazing. (Drops the sheet.)
s08_e14_c02_u051	(looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
s08_e14_c02_u052	Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
s08_e14_c03_u053	Hey babe.
s08_e14_c03_u054	Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)
s08_e14_c03_u055	Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
s08_e14_c03_u056	No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
s08_e14_c03_u057	How about to the street say from the balcony?
s08_e14_c03_u058	Why don't we just find a place for it?
s08_e14_c03_u059	Okay. How about in that cabinet?
s08_e14_c03_u060	No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
s08_e14_c03_u061	How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the bathroom.)
s08_e14_c03_u062	Oh, okay. Here, why don't you let me do it?
s08_e14_c03_u063	Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.) It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
s08_e14_c03_u064	No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
s08_e14_c03_u065	Oh y'know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
s08_e14_c03_u066	Feminine stuff.
s08_e14_c03_u067	Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
s08_e14_c03_u068	Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you'll let it go.
s08_e14_c03_u069	Fine.
s08_e14_c03_u070	Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)
s08_e14_c03_u071	(walking casually away) Love you.
s08_e14_c03_u072	(entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!
s08_e14_c03_u073	Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said, "If it helps!" (Goes to the bedroom.)
s08_e14_c03_u074	Why won't you let me massage you?
s08_e14_c03_u075	Well it's-I mean I'd just-I'd be self-conscious. You're my friend; I'd be naked.
s08_e14_c03_u076	Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
s08_e14_c03_u077	That's different, we were roommates! And when?!
s08_e14_c03_u078	I'm curious about the human body.
s08_e14_c03_u079	Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
s08_e14_c03_u080	But I'm a professional! And I'm really good! Look, if you're uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
s08_e14_c03_u081	Okay, if it means that much to you
s08_e14_c03_u082	It does! How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
s08_e14_c03_u083	Dinosaurs.
s08_e14_c03_u084	Potato, potaato.
s08_e14_c04_u085	Hey!
s08_e14_c04_u086	Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
s08_e14_c04_u087	What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs Rachel's belly.)
s08_e14_c04_u088	It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do (Mimics him) that again.
s08_e14_c04_u089	Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
s08_e14_c04_u090	Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping
s08_e14_c04_u091	A dreamless sleep.
s08_e14_c04_u092	My God, the baby's kicking. That's great. Although I-kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know.
s08_e14_c04_u093	Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.
s08_e14_c04_u094	Look, I-I don't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So-Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
s08_e14_c04_u095	Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
s08_e14_c05_u096	(calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?
s08_e14_c05_u097	Yes.
s08_e14_c05_u098	(in a soothing voice) Great, let's begin. (She starts the massage.) How's the pressure?
s08_e14_c05_u099	Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
s08_e14_c05_u100	Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird is it.
s08_e14_c05_u101	No. Ooohh
s08_e14_c05_u102	That's right, you just enjoy.
s08_e14_c05_u103	(in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
s08_e14_c05_u104	(getting uncomfortable) Okay.
s08_e14_c05_u105	Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that's it! That's it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh- (Covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)
s08_e14_c06_u106	I wasn't trying to open your closet! I wasn't trying to open your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)
s08_e14_c06_u107	Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
s08_e14_c06_u108	Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
s08_e14_c06_u109	Why not?
s08_e14_c06_u110	I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
s08_e14_c06_u111	I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard.
s08_e14_c06_u112	Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
s08_e14_c06_u113	Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
s08_e14_c06_u114	And here we go
s08_e14_c06_u115	I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y'know it wouldn't kill ya to respect your wife's privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the door.) Stupid closet full of bugs!
s08_e14_c06_u116	Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)
s08_e14_c06_u117	Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
s08_e14_c06_u118	Really?
s08_e14_c06_u119	Absolutely. But, we're gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on.
s08_e14_c06_u120	Okay. Oh God-Ow!-Oo!
s08_e14_c06_u121	Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing bones!
s08_e14_c07_u122	Hey! So?
s08_e14_c07_u123	She's fine. She's experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
s08_e14_c07_u124	Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
s08_e14_c07_u125	So but everything is normal.
s08_e14_c07_u126	Absolutely.
s08_e14_c07_u127	And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?
s08_e14_c07_u128	No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are, but she's fine.
s08_e14_c07_u129	Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
s08_e14_c07_u130	Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!
s08_e14_c07_u131	But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
s08_e14_c07_u132	Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
s08_e14_c07_u133	But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
s08_e14_c07_u134	You sure?!
s08_e14_c07_u135	Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though. Mild discomfort, what's he talking about?
s08_e14_c07_u136	(seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!
s08_e14_c07_u137	(rushes in) Is everything okay?
s08_e14_c07_u138	Yeah, everything's fine!
s08_e14_c07_u139	Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
s08_e14_c07_u140	Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
s08_e14_c07_u141	Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don't even feel them.
s08_e14_c07_u142	Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
s08_e14_c07_u143	Hey uh, what's with the candy?
s08_e14_c07_u144	Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
s08_e14_c07_u145	Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
s08_e14_c07_u146	No I-Mona!
s08_e14_c07_u147	Oh, I gotta go back in there.
s08_e14_c07_u148	What? Why? What's wrong?
s08_e14_c07_u149	No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back
s08_e14_c07_u150	No really, you tell me what's up.
s08_e14_c07_u151	I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)
s08_e14_c07_u152	(To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
s08_e14_c07_u153	Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal.
s08_e14_c07_u154	Yeah but still, I mean it should've been me. I'm the dad.
s08_e14_c07_u155	(To Joey) Uh, if you have any questions, here's some information on Braxton-Hicks. (Hands Joey a pamphlet.) Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. You're gonna make a wonderful father.
s08_e14_c07_u156	Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He brought Twizlers!
s08_e14_c08_u157	There has got to be a way!
s08_e14_c08_u158	Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
s08_e14_c08_u159	Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.
s08_e14_c08_u160	Then why do you throw like one?
s08_e14_c08_u161	Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
s08_e14_c08_u162	Sure. "Monica."
s08_e14_c08_u163	So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
s08_e14_c08_u164	Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think-I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God- You should've seen the look on Ross's face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
s08_e14_c08_u165	That's a good idea.
s08_e14_c08_u166	Yeah.
s08_e14_c08_u167	Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
s08_e14_c08_u168	Oh, I just-I feel terrible.
s08_e14_c08_u169	Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the door.) Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?
s08_e14_c09_u170	Hey.
s08_e14_c09_u171	Hey.
s08_e14_c09_u172	I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
s08_e14_c09_u173	No-no, I got that.
s08_e14_c09_u174	So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
s08_e14_c09_u175	Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
s08_e14_c09_u176	Okay.
s08_e14_c09_u177	I mean $500.
s08_e14_c09_u178	What?
s08_e14_c09_u179	600.
s08_e14_c09_u180	What's going on?
s08_e14_c09_u181	Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
s08_e14_c09_u182	What? (Laughs.)
s08_e14_c09_u183	Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
s08_e14_c09_u184	What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
s08_e14_c09_u185	Really? There's nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?! (Pause) I mean hi.
s08_e14_c09_u186	Oh my-This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again!
s08_e14_c09_u187	No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
s08_e14_c09_u188	Really?!
s08_e14_c09_u189	Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it.
s08_e14_c09_u190	Are you sure?
s08_e14_c09_u191	Yes.
s08_e14_c09_u192	I guess.
s08_e14_c09_u193	Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you hear something you liked?
s08_e14_c10_u194	Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
s08_e14_c10_u195	Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
s08_e14_c10_u196	Ohh! That's so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?
s08_e14_c10_u197	Well yeah!
s08_e14_c10_u198	Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
s08_e14_c10_u199	What?! What?! Rach what?!
s08_e14_c10_u200	What's going on?
s08_e14_c10_u201	I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
s08_e14_c10_u202	Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
s08_e14_c10_u203	(to Rachel) I-I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
s08_e14_c10_u204	Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
s08_e14_c10_u205	I'm on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)
s08_e14_c10_u206	I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
s08_e14_c10_u207	Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
s08_e14_c10_u208	Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.
s08_e14_c10_u209	(entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
s08_e14_c10_u210	Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
s08_e14_c10_u211	Yeah.
s08_e14_c10_u212	What's up?
s08_e14_c10_u213	Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
s08_e14_c10_u214	(Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?
s08_e14_c10_u215	The thing is-'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross-Ross is missing everything. So
s08_e14_c10_u216	Yeah?
s08_e14_c10_u217	Maybe you two should live together.
s08_e14_c10_u218	Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
s08_e14_c10_u219	Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that-if you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father.
s08_e14_c10_u220	But Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean-(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)-Or he does.
s08_e14_c10_u221	No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
s08_e14_c10_u222	But Ross, its you and me!
s08_e14_c10_u223	So? Sure! But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
s08_e14_c10_u224	All right now, so? What do you think?
s08_e14_c10_u225	I don't know. Is it crazy?
s08_e14_c10_u226	No! No it's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
s08_e14_c10_u227	Well, I was due.
s08_e14_c10_u228	Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
s08_e14_c10_u229	Really?
s08_e14_c10_u230	Yeah.
s08_e14_c10_u231	Oh Rach that's great. That's great. (They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)
s08_e14_c11_u232	Not to shabby, I got this all off myself-using my wife's tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what's behind the green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!
s08_e14_c11_u233	(entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!
s08_e14_c11_u234	(laughs) You're messy.
s08_e14_c11_u235	Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!
s08_e14_c11_u236	I married Fred Sanford!
s08_e14_c11_u237	No Chandler, you don't understand! (Chandler starts singing the theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm y'know-I'm sick.
s08_e14_c11_u238	No, honey you're not sick! Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that.
s08_e14_c11_u239	Really? You promise you won't tell anyone?
s08_e14_c11_u240	Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
s08_e14_c11_u241	Well-it's just umm-I'm afraid you might mess it up.
s08_e14_c12_u242	Hey.
s08_e14_c12_u243	Hey.
s08_e14_c12_u244	So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
s08_e14_c12_u245	Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
s08_e14_c12_u246	Are you okay?
s08_e14_c12_u247	Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)
s08_e14_c13_u248	Ohhh.
s08_e14_c13_u249	That's it. Just relax.
s08_e14_c13_u250	Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
s08_e14_c13_u251	Come on more!
s08_e14_c13_u252	Oh God!
s08_e14_c13_u253	Yeah, you like that don't you?
s08_e14_c13_u254	Oh yeah right there!
s08_e14_c13_u255	You want it there? You take it there baby!
s08_e14_c13_u256	Uh Phoebe?
s08_e14_c13_u257	Yeah, say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what she's doing.) And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again.
s06_e10_c01_u001	Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
s06_e10_c01_u002	That's a good story, Grandpa.
s06_e10_c01_u003	Ross: Hey
s06_e10_c01_u004	Hey
s06_e10_c01_u005	Ross: Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
s06_e10_c01_u006	Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
s06_e10_c01_u007	That is nice and we're done. TADA!
s06_e10_c01_u008	I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
s06_e10_c01_u009	Oh, here.
s06_e10_c01_u010	See now it feels like Christmas!
s06_e10_c02_u011	Ross: - and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
s06_e10_c02_u012	So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
s06_e10_c02_u013	Hey you guys.
s06_e10_c02_u014	Hey Joe what's up?
s06_e10_c02_u015	I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like- (He imitates her stretching)
s06_e10_c02_u016	I can see why that's hard to resist.
s06_e10_c02_u017	I like her so much!
s06_e10_c02_u018	Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.
s06_e10_c02_u019	I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
s06_e10_c02_u020	You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
s06_e10_c02_u021	Ross: I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!
s06_e10_c02_u022	Hey guys!
s06_e10_c02_u023	Ross: Hi Janine!
s06_e10_c02_u024	I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year's Eve. It's called some sort of Dick'n Rock'n Dickie Eve.
s06_e10_c02_u025	Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
s06_e10_c02_u026	Yeah, that's what I said.
s06_e10_c02_u027	Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
s06_e10_c02_u028	Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you? (He kisses her on the cheek)
s06_e10_c02_u029	Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
s06_e10_c02_u030	Ross: You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
s06_e10_c02_u031	Well they said I should bring someone. (To Joey) Do you wanna be my dance partner?
s06_e10_c02_u032	Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
s06_e10_c02_u033	Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't really understand why.
s06_e10_c02_u034	Ross: Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.
s06_e10_c02_u035	Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
s06_e10_c02_u036	Ross: Are you serious?
s06_e10_c02_u037	We are there!
s06_e10_c02_u038	What, what are you laughing at?
s06_e10_c02_u039	Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!
s06_e10_c02_u040	Thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
s06_e10_c02_u041	Bye!
s06_e10_c02_u042	Ross: Bye Janine!
s06_e10_c02_u043	Did she just ask me out on a date?
s06_e10_c02_u044	I don't think so.
s06_e10_c02_u045	What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
s06_e10_c02_u046	Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.
s06_e10_c02_u047	Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say It wasn't me, it was New Years!'
s06_e10_c02_u048	Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
s06_e10_c02_u049	Ross: It was a dry day.
s06_e10_c02_u050	We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
s06_e10_c02_u051	Ross: Oh my God!
s06_e10_c02_u052	Oh my God!
s06_e10_c02_u053	(To Rachel) Oh my God!
s06_e10_c03_u054	OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember  stay cool.
s06_e10_c03_u055	Ross: Got it!
s06_e10_c03_u056	Ross: Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
s06_e10_c03_u057	OK, everyone gather up.
s06_e10_c03_u058	Here's what's gonna happen. The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance, we're gonna tape, you don't look at the camera. Any questions?
s06_e10_c03_u059	Ross: Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?
s06_e10_c03_u060	Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.
s06_e10_c03_u061	Ross! So when is it gonna air?
s06_e10_c04_u062	Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
s06_e10_c04_u063	I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
s06_e10_c04_u064	Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
s06_e10_c04_u065	We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
s06_e10_c04_u066	What? That's terrible!
s06_e10_c04_u067	No-no, we do it every year!
s06_e10_c04_u068	Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
s06_e10_c04_u069	No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx.
s06_e10_c04_u070	Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
s06_e10_c04_u071	No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
s06_e10_c04_u072	But we have to!
s06_e10_c04_u073	No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too.
s06_e10_c04_u074	Well then, you should look with us.
s06_e10_c04_u075	Why?
s06_e10_c04_u076	Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
s06_e10_c04_u077	No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
s06_e10_c04_u078	Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!
s06_e10_c04_u079	Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
s06_e10_c04_u080	If I help, we can find em faster!
s06_e10_c04_u081	That's right!
s06_e10_c04_u082	Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
s06_e10_c04_u083	Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
s06_e10_c04_u084	Ooh, who's it for?
s06_e10_c04_u085	Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
s06_e10_c04_u086	We are so gonna find them this year.
s06_e10_c04_u087	Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?
s06_e10_c04_u088	Yeah.
s06_e10_c04_u089	You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
s06_e10_c04_u090	Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)
s06_e10_c05_u091	Okay, here comes another camera.
s06_e10_c05_u092	Ross: Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
s06_e10_c05_u093	Ross: Why do they keep doing that?
s06_e10_c05_u094	If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.
s06_e10_c05_u095	Ross: Right.
s06_e10_c05_u096	Ross: Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
s06_e10_c05_u097	Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
s06_e10_c05_u098	Ross: Yeah!
s06_e10_c05_u099	Hey! You're a good dancer!
s06_e10_c05_u100	Really?
s06_e10_c05_u101	Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
s06_e10_c05_u102	What do you mean?
s06_e10_c05_u103	Like this.
s06_e10_c05_u104	That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.
s06_e10_c05_u105	Uh-huh.
s06_e10_c05_u106	(To Joey) Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.
s06_e10_c05_u107	No-no-no-no-no we came together!
s06_e10_c05_u108	I don't see it. (To Janine) You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! (He does. Janine goes over to him.)
s06_e10_c05_u109	No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.
s06_e10_c05_u110	Really, y'think so? I don't..
s06_e10_c06_u111	I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
s06_e10_c06_u112	Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
s06_e10_c06_u113	Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
s06_e10_c06_u114	Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
s06_e10_c06_u115	Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
s06_e10_c06_u116	Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?
s06_e10_c06_u117	Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
s06_e10_c06_u118	Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
s06_e10_c06_u119	Ha!
s06_e10_c06_u120	Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
s06_e10_c06_u121	Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
s06_e10_c07_u122	Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place dance) Looking good Gellers!
s06_e10_c07_u123	Ross: We know!
s06_e10_c07_u124	Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
s06_e10_c07_u125	Ross: Okay.
s06_e10_c07_u126	Okay, everybody hold!
s06_e10_c07_u127	Next on the platforms are- (He points to the right of Ross and Monica, so they dance over to where he's pointing to. He points away from them) -you two! And- (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm. Again he points away.) -You two!
s06_e10_c07_u128	Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?
s06_e10_c07_u129	Ross: Monica! (Pause) Would it?
s06_e10_c08_u130	Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.
s06_e10_c08_u131	Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..
s06_e10_c08_u132	Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!
s06_e10_c08_u133	Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know
s06_e10_c08_u134	Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his hands) if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws water on the guy's pants)
s06_e10_c08_u135	Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful on him and runs out)
s06_e10_c09_u136	Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?
s06_e10_c09_u137	Ross: Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!
s06_e10_c09_u138	What?
s06_e10_c09_u139	Ross: The routine!
s06_e10_c09_u140	Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
s06_e10_c09_u141	Ross: Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!
s06_e10_c09_u142	Was it really that good?
s06_e10_c09_u143	Ross: We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
s06_e10_c09_u144	Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
s06_e10_c09_u145	5 6 7 8!
s06_e10_c09_u146	Ross: So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?
s06_e10_c09_u147	Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!
s06_e10_c09_u148	Yes! (They run over to a platform)
s06_e10_c09_u149	(To Cameraman) Make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. (To everyone) Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody's excitement.
s06_e10_c09_u150	What's going on over here?
s06_e10_c09_u151	Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
s06_e10_c09_u152	What's the matter with you? Get out of here!
s06_e10_c09_u153	Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
s06_e10_c09_u154	Ross: Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
s06_e10_c09_u155	I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?
s06_e10_c09_u156	Ross: No!
s06_e10_c09_u157	Me too!
s06_e10_c09_u158	Ross: Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know? (He mimics a robot)
s06_e10_c09_u159	Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!
s06_e10_c09_u160	Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! (He continues to count as we hear Joey think)
s06_e10_c09_u161	Three, Two, One!
s06_e10_c09_u162	Cut!
s06_e10_c09_u163	No! Year! Happy No Year!
s06_e10_c09_u164	Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone that's a wrap!
s06_e10_c10_u165	Hey! Look who I found!
s06_e10_c10_u166	Oh, hey guys!
s06_e10_c10_u167	Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
s06_e10_c10_u168	Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
s06_e10_c10_u169	Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!
s06_e10_c10_u170	Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?
s06_e10_c10_u171	Hmm, how about my azzz?
s06_e10_c10_u172	Hey, this is hollow.
s06_e10_c10_u173	What?
s06_e10_c10_u174	This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! (She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!
s06_e10_c10_u175	No, don't look directly at them!
s06_e10_c10_u176	What?
s06_e10_c10_u177	Alright, no, we could look at them!
s06_e10_c10_u178	Oh, this one's for me!
s06_e10_c10_u179	Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here.
s06_e10_c10_u180	Oh great!
s06_e10_c10_u181	And the big one's for me!
s06_e10_c10_u182	Ooh, let's open them!
s06_e10_c10_u183	Okay! Okay! Okay!
s06_e10_c10_u184	Hee hee!
s06_e10_c10_u185	Wait, we can't do this.
s06_e10_c10_u186	Why?
s06_e10_c10_u187	I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
s06_e10_c10_u188	Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine.
s06_e10_c10_u189	Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
s06_e10_c10_u190	Will you get us better gifts?
s06_e10_c10_u191	Fine!
s06_e10_c10_u192	Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
s06_e10_c10_u193	That's what you got me?
s06_e10_c10_u194	Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
s06_e10_c11_u195	Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!
s06_e10_c11_u196	Joey.
s06_e10_c11_u197	Yeah?
s06_e10_c11_u198	(She takes his hands) 3, 2, 1. (She kisses him) Happy New Year.
s06_e10_c11_u199	Oh, yoii. What was that for?
s06_e10_c11_u200	Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
s06_e10_c11_u201	Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
s06_e10_c11_u202	In the moment, yeah.
s06_e10_c11_u203	But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
s06_e10_c11_u204	Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
s06_e10_c11_u205	No.
s06_e10_c11_u206	Me neither.
s06_e10_c11_u207	3, 2,
s06_e10_c11_u208	Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
s06_e10_c11_u209	Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
s06_e10_c12_u210	We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!'
s06_e10_c12_u211	Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
s06_e10_c12_u212	Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
s06_e10_c12_u213	Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
s06_e10_c12_u214	What? We could do it!
s06_e10_c12_u215	Ross: I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
s06_e10_c12_u216	I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go. (She and Ross get up)
s06_e10_c12_u217	Monica and Ross: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught by Monica, but she moves out of the way)
s06_e10_c12_u218	I can't do it! (Ross falls into Monica's room)
s06_e10_c12_u219	Now you do that, you're on TV.
s07_e16_c01_u001	Hi.
s07_e16_c01_u002	Hi! Hi Ben!
s07_e16_c01_u003	Hi.
s07_e16_c01_u004	Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
s07_e16_c01_u005	Oh, yeah go ahead.
s07_e16_c01_u006	Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
s07_e16_c01_u007	No. No.
s07_e16_c01_u008	(to Ben) Okay! All clear!
s07_e16_c01_u009	(running to the bathroom) Thanks Phoebe!
s07_e16_c01_u010	Ben, its Rachel! (He closes the door.) But whatever.
s07_e16_c01_u011	(to Ben) Everything okay in there?
s07_e16_c01_u012	Don't talk to me now!
s07_e16_c01_u013	Awww, just like his daddy.
s07_e16_c01_u014	Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
s07_e16_c01_u015	What-what about Monica?
s07_e16_c01_u016	Oh, she isn't home.
s07_e16_c01_u017	(nervous) So it would just be, me alone?
s07_e16_c01_u018	Well, Ben would be there.
s07_e16_c01_u019	Huh umm
s07_e16_c01_u020	What's the matter?
s07_e16_c01_u021	Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone.
s07_e16_c01_u022	Rach, he's not an ex-con.
s07_e16_c01_u023	Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
s07_e16_c01_u024	I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
s07_e16_c01_u025	Okay.
s07_e16_c01_u026	Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
s07_e16_c01_u027	Yeah I think so.
s07_e16_c01_u028	(To Rachel) I wasn't talking to you.
s07_e16_c01_u029	I'll be okay.
s07_e16_c01_u030	Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back in an hour.
s07_e16_c01_u031	Bye dad.
s07_e16_c01_u032	Bye. (Ross exits.) Ahhh- (Silence) So this is fun, huh?
s07_e16_c01_u033	Not really.
s07_e16_c01_u034	Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
s07_e16_c01_u035	Okay.
s07_e16_c01_u036	Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
s07_e16_c01_u037	I'm not allowed to have soda.
s07_e16_c01_u038	Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita? (Holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)
s07_e16_c01_u039	What's a virgin?
s07_e16_c01_u040	Water it is.
s07_e16_c02_u041	What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
s07_e16_c02_u042	You mean the spitter?
s07_e16_c02_u043	Come on! It wasn't that bad!
s07_e16_c02_u044	Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
s07_e16_c02_u045	All right, what about the third guy?
s07_e16_c02_u046	You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
s07_e16_c02_u047	Can you blame him?
s07_e16_c02_u048	Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, "I do," he's thinking, "Yeah, I'd do her too!"
s07_e16_c02_u049	Well then we still have a problem.
s07_e16_c02_u050	Yeah!
s07_e16_c02_u051	(returning with Joey) With what?
s07_e16_c02_u052	Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies. (Points to her chest.)
s07_e16_c02_u053	Oo! You should have one of us do it!
s07_e16_c02_u054	Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
s07_e16_c02_u055	No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
s07_e16_c02_u056	Are you serious?
s07_e16_c02_u057	Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
s07_e16_c02_u058	I call it!!
s07_e16_c02_u059	What?! No! It was my idea!
s07_e16_c02_u060	Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
s07_e16_c02_u061	Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
s07_e16_c02_u062	We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
s07_e16_c03_u063	Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
s07_e16_c03_u064	But you're not anymore!
s07_e16_c03_u065	No, I'm not.
s07_e16_c03_u066	Cause you guys were on a break.
s07_e16_c03_u067	Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
s07_e16_c03_u068	When's my daddy coming back?
s07_e16_c03_u069	(checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.
s07_e16_c03_u070	Sharing is good.
s07_e16_c03_u071	Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
s07_e16_c03_u072	Really? Like how?
s07_e16_c03_u073	Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.
s07_e16_c03_u074	(laughs) That's a good one.
s07_e16_c03_u075	Yeah? You like that one?
s07_e16_c03_u076	Yeah, you're funny.
s07_e16_c03_u077	I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
s07_e16_c03_u078	Can I do it to you?
s07_e16_c03_u079	Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?
s07_e16_c04_u080	So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
s07_e16_c04_u081	No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
s07_e16_c04_u082	We're never gonna find anybody.
s07_e16_c04_u083	Well then let me do it!
s07_e16_c04_u084	Joe
s07_e16_c04_u085	No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
s07_e16_c04_u086	Joey look it's really sweet
s07_e16_c04_u087	No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!
s07_e16_c04_u088	That is true.
s07_e16_c04_u089	Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
s07_e16_c04_u090	(To Monica) Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.
s07_e16_c04_u091	It might be kinda cool.
s07_e16_c04_u092	So I can do it?
s07_e16_c04_u093	Yeah you can do it.
s07_e16_c04_u094	All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?
s07_e16_c04_u095	Yeah.
s07_e16_c04_u096	Okay.
s07_e16_c04_u097	Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
s07_e16_c04_u098	Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
s07_e16_c04_u099	Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?
s07_e16_c04_u100	Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!
s07_e16_c04_u101	Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)
s07_e16_c04_u102	What is it?
s07_e16_c04_u103	It's Hexadrin.
s07_e16_c04_u104	Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (She's pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)
s07_e16_c04_u105	Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down-(She sits down on the couch)-gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.
s07_e16_c04_u106	Oh.
s07_e16_c04_u107	Oh! My head! Oh! (He's sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!
s07_e16_c05_u108	Coming.
s07_e16_c05_u109	I have a bone to pick with you.
s07_e16_c05_u110	Uh-oh.
s07_e16_c05_u111	Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
s07_e16_c05_u112	Oh yeah? Did he pull the old- (She is waving her hand up and down her face. She's thinking about the pencil mark.)
s07_e16_c05_u113	That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
s07_e16_c05_u114	Oh that.
s07_e16_c05_u115	Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
s07_e16_c05_u116	Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!
s07_e16_c05_u117	I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
s07_e16_c05_u118	(looking at his mark) Yes.
s07_e16_c06_u119	It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
s07_e16_c06_u120	Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)
s07_e16_c06_u121	Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a story! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)
s07_e16_c06_u122	No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
s07_e16_c06_u123	Say what?
s07_e16_c06_u124	Y'know, the possible side affects.
s07_e16_c06_u125	Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!
s07_e16_c06_u126	Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
s07_e16_c06_u127	Why?
s07_e16_c06_u128	In case it happens.
s07_e16_c06_u129	(entering) Hey!
s07_e16_c06_u130	Hey!
s07_e16_c06_u131	Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)
s07_e16_c06_u132	Hey!
s07_e16_c06_u133	You did it! You got ordained?!
s07_e16_c06_u134	Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
s07_e16_c06_u135	Our minister
s07_e16_c06_u136	I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)
s07_e16_c06_u137	Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her torso.)
s07_e16_c06_u138	Okay, then I must be disoriented.
s07_e16_c06_u139	Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
s07_e16_c06_u140	Okay.
s07_e16_c06_u141	Yeah!
s07_e16_c06_u142	Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so- (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share." (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nods her approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive."
s07_e16_c06_u143	(To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
s07_e16_c07_u144	Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the quarter trick with her as well.)
s07_e16_c07_u145	Hi!
s07_e16_c07_u146	What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
s07_e16_c07_u147	Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
s07_e16_c07_u148	Can I ask what-Come on in.
s07_e16_c07_u149	Okay.
s07_e16_c07_u150	Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.
s07_e16_c07_u151	I'd love that. I would loooove- (Carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
s07_e16_c07_u152	(jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)
s07_e16_c07_u153	I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?
s07_e16_c07_u154	(from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?
s07_e16_c07_u155	Yes oh-(To Ben)-Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.) No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
s07_e16_c07_u156	(mimicking her) Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
s07_e16_c07_u157	Don't do that.
s07_e16_c07_u158	Don't do that.
s07_e16_c07_u159	Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
s07_e16_c07_u160	Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.
s07_e16_c07_u161	Oh damnit!
s07_e16_c07_u162	Oh damnit!
s07_e16_c07_u163	No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
s07_e16_c07_u164	Damnit!
s07_e16_c07_u165	No don't! Go back to repeating!
s07_e16_c07_u166	Damnit!
s07_e16_c07_u167	Oh crap!
s07_e16_c07_u168	Oh crap!
s07_e16_c08_u169	I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?
s07_e16_c08_u170	Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
s07_e16_c08_u171	Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! (Holds up the warning label.)
s07_e16_c08_u172	Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
s07_e16_c08_u173	Yeah. O-okay.
s07_e16_c08_u174	(reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and-" And then I can't think of a good word for right here. (He points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)
s07_e16_c08_u175	How about receiving?
s07_e16_c08_u176	Yes!
s07_e16_c08_u177	See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
s07_e16_c08_u178	Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
s07_e16_c08_u179	No, not us- (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)
s07_e16_c08_u180	I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
s07_e16_c08_u181	Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
s07_e16_c08_u182	It doesn't say that!
s07_e16_c08_u183	Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
s07_e16_c08_u184	See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
s07_e16_c08_u185	Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, "Began their beautiful journey-"
s07_e16_c08_u186	There you go!
s07_e16_c08_u187	"-by doin' it."
s07_e16_c08_u188	Joe?
s07_e16_c08_u189	Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
s07_e16_c08_u190	Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
s07_e16_c08_u191	Yeah!! I call that London style.
s07_e16_c08_u192	No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.
s07_e16_c08_u193	Oh.
s07_e16_c08_u194	And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much
s07_e16_c08_u195	Yeah baby!
s07_e16_c08_u196	And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
s07_e16_c08_u197	Oh.
s07_e16_c08_u198	But then later that night
s07_e16_c08_u199	Yeah baby!
s07_e16_c08_u200	(answering the door) Hey!
s07_e16_c08_u201	(standing outside) Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
s07_e16_c08_u202	Well I was- I was exactly expecting company after-(He looks at his watch.) 9:15.
s07_e16_c08_u203	(entering) Is Joey here?
s07_e16_c08_u204	Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
s07_e16_c08_u205	Wouldn't you be?
s07_e16_c08_u206	Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
s07_e16_c08_u207	Really?
s07_e16_c08_u208	You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms- (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
s07_e16_c08_u209	Well, not anymore.
s07_e16_c08_u210	But we don't do that.
s07_e16_c08_u211	I know, I just thought it would be fun.
s07_e16_c08_u212	How drunk are you?
s07_e16_c08_u213	Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
s07_e16_c08_u214	(thinks) That's the perfect amount!
s07_e16_c08_u215	Okay!
s07_e16_c08_u216	(breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?
s07_e16_c08_u217	What?
s07_e16_c08_u218	This doesn't feel weird!
s07_e16_c08_u219	I know.
s07_e16_c08_u220	You're a really good kisser.
s07_e16_c08_u221	Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
s07_e16_c08_u222	Hm-hmm!
s07_e16_c08_u223	Okay!
s07_e16_c08_u224	Wow! You are really fast!
s07_e16_c08_u225	It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
s07_e16_c08_u226	We're gonna see each other naked.
s07_e16_c08_u227	Yep!
s07_e16_c08_u228	Do you wanna do it at the same time?
s07_e16_c08_u229	Count of three?
s07_e16_c08_u230	One!
s07_e16_c08_u231	Two!
s07_e16_c08_u232	Two!
s07_e16_c08_u233	Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
s07_e16_c08_u234	Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
s07_e16_c08_u235	Eh!
s07_e16_c08_u236	Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)
s07_e16_c08_u237	Hey!
s07_e16_c08_u238	Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e- (Notices that the TV is turned off.)
s07_e16_c08_u239	Oh, dude I'm so sorry!
s07_e16_c08_u240	No! No! No!
s07_e16_c08_u241	Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?
s07_e16_c08_u242	They're in my bag over there. (Points.)
s07_e16_c08_u243	Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler's bag by getting as far away from Chandler's bed as possible.)
s07_e16_c08_u244	Uh, could you leave me one?
s07_e16_c08_u245	(pause) For just you?
s07_e16_c08_u246	Yeah.
s07_e16_c08_u247	Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.
s07_e16_c08_u248	No I-I-I'm fine.
s07_e16_c08_u249	All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)
s07_e16_c08_u250	That's what that was?! Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
s07_e16_c08_u251	Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.
s07_e16_c08_u252	Oh- (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
s07_e16_c08_u253	Yeah, it's totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
s07_e16_c08_u254	What?!
s07_e16_c08_u255	What?
s07_e16_c08_u256	(To Joey) What?!
s07_e16_c08_u257	Who did you originally want to hook up with?
s07_e16_c08_u258	Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted-just sex. So, when I-went to your room that night-I was actually looking-for Joey. (Joey smiles.)
s07_e16_c08_u259	Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!
s07_e16_c09_u260	(To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
s07_e16_c09_u261	No because it-it didn't seem important.
s07_e16_c09_u262	Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!
s07_e16_c09_u263	Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
s07_e16_c09_u264	And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-(Shuts up on Monica's glare.)
s07_e16_c09_u265	I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
s07_e16_c09_u266	Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
s07_e16_c09_u267	Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!
s07_e16_c09_u268	(To Joey) Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
s07_e16_c09_u269	What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! (To Monica) I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
s07_e16_c09_u270	Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need-I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
s07_e16_c09_u271	Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!
s07_e16_c09_u272	It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)
s07_e16_c09_u273	This is crazy.
s07_e16_c09_u274	I know! Robin is so gay!
s07_e16_c10_u275	So now what have we agreed?
s07_e16_c10_u276	No more pranks.
s07_e16_c10_u277	And-and what else?
s07_e16_c10_u278	That you and daddy were not on a break.
s07_e16_c10_u279	Very good.
s07_e16_c10_u280	Rachel! What are you doing here?
s07_e16_c10_u281	I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
s07_e16_c10_u282	Your good friend?
s07_e16_c10_u283	Yeah!
s07_e16_c10_u284	What's her last name?
s07_e16_c10_u285	Carol-Lesbian?
s07_e16_c10_u286	Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
s07_e16_c10_u287	What line?
s07_e16_c10_u288	Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) "Dude, don't you ever was your face?"
s07_e16_c10_u289	All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
s07_e16_c10_u290	Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
s07_e16_c10_u291	(entering from the kitchen) Hey Ross!
s07_e16_c10_u292	Hi.
s07_e16_c10_u293	What's not funny?
s07_e16_c10_u294	Practical jokes.
s07_e16_c10_u295	Oh I-I think they're funny.
s07_e16_c10_u296	You have a line down your face.
s07_e16_c10_u297	What? (Goes and checks.)
s07_e16_c10_u298	Okay, maybe they are not funny to you
s07_e16_c10_u299	(yelling from the bathroom) Oh my God!
s07_e16_c10_u300	Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
s07_e16_c10_u301	Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
s07_e16_c10_u302	That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"
s07_e16_c10_u303	I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
s07_e16_c10_u304	Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
s07_e16_c10_u305	No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I
s07_e16_c10_u306	Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
s07_e16_c10_u307	(yelling from off camera) Crap!!
s07_e16_c10_u308	I gotta go! (Runs out.)
s07_e16_c11_u309	Hey.
s07_e16_c11_u310	Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
s07_e16_c11_u311	Chandler, come on nothing even happened!
s07_e16_c11_u312	Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding
s07_e16_c11_u313	No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just-I don't want you to be upset.
s07_e16_c11_u314	How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
s07_e16_c11_u315	Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just-it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever.
s07_e16_c11_u316	That's what you should say.
s07_e16_c11_u317	What?
s07_e16_c11_u318	When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
s07_e16_c11_u319	Really? I can do it?
s07_e16_c11_u320	I'd love it if you would do it.
s07_e16_c11_u321	Hey! (They hug.)
s07_e16_c11_u322	But those are the words! Those exact words!
s07_e16_c11_u323	Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
s07_e16_c12_u324	Hey!
s07_e16_c12_u325	Hey!
s07_e16_c12_u326	Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, Fun Aunt' Rachel, so
s07_e16_c12_u327	Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben? (He nods yes.)
s07_e16_c12_u328	Okay, I'll see you later pal.
s07_e16_c12_u329	Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads Poop.') Wh-Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it.
s07_e16_c12_u330	What?
s07_e16_c12_u331	I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. (To Ross) You've got something here on your back.
s07_e16_c12_u332	What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That's great. That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
s07_e16_c12_u333	Oh I
s07_e16_c12_u334	What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
s07_e16_c12_u335	All right, that's it! (He runs over to Ben, but he runs past him and out the door.) Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!
s07_e16_c12_u336	No! Wait! Come on!
s07_e16_c12_u337	Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
s07_e16_c12_u338	No you guys- (She walks out into the hallway.)
s07_e16_c12_u339	I-I-am-(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)
s07_e16_c12_u340	EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)
s07_e16_c13_u341	Hey!
s07_e16_c13_u342	Hey-hey.
s07_e16_c13_u343	So are guys doing okay?
s07_e16_c13_u344	Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
s07_e16_c13_u345	Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.)
s07_e16_c13_u346	I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.
s07_e16_c14_u347	Honey! Dinner's ready!
s07_e16_c14_u348	Your favorite!
s07_e16_c14_u349	Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!
s07_e16_c14_u350	Yep! And lot's of it!
s07_e16_c14_u351	Okay, in we go.
s07_e16_c15_u352	Here you go.
s07_e16_c15_u353	(still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks her watch) That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
s07_e16_c15_u354	Good for you!
s07_e16_c15_u355	Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! Cause look, (reads the side affects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh.
s01_e19_c01_u001	Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (Guy shakes his head) Okay.
s01_e19_c02_u002	Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
s01_e19_c02_u003	Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
s01_e19_c02_u004	Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
s01_e19_c02_u005	Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
s01_e19_c02_u006	What is it?
s01_e19_c02_u007	Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
s01_e19_c02_u008	Barry who you almost...?
s01_e19_c02_u009	Barry who I almost.
s01_e19_c02_u010	And Mindy, your maid of...?
s01_e19_c02_u011	Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
s01_e19_c02_u012	(Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
s01_e19_c03_u013	Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachel ignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
s01_e19_c03_u014	What?
s01_e19_c03_u015	Hi.
s01_e19_c03_u016	Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
s01_e19_c03_u017	Really.
s01_e19_c03_u018	No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
s01_e19_c03_u019	Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
s01_e19_c03_u020	Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
s01_e19_c03_u021	Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
s01_e19_c03_u022	Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
s01_e19_c03_u023	Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
s01_e19_c03_u024	Hi.
s01_e19_c03_u025	...Gets interrupted. Hi!
s01_e19_c03_u026	Hi, how was the movie?
s01_e19_c03_u027	Wonderful!
s01_e19_c03_u028	So good!
s01_e19_c03_u029	Suck-fest.
s01_e19_c03_u030	Toootal chick-flick.
s01_e19_c03_u031	I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
s01_e19_c03_u032	Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
s01_e19_c03_u033	There was nudity!
s01_e19_c03_u034	I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
s01_e19_c03_u035	Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
s01_e19_c03_u036	They're still just friends, right?
s01_e19_c03_u037	(To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!
s01_e19_c03_u038	That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
s01_e19_c03_u039	Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
s01_e19_c03_u040	'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
s01_e19_c04_u041	I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
s01_e19_c04_u042	I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
s01_e19_c04_u043	I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
s01_e19_c04_u044	I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
s01_e19_c04_u045	She really said that?
s01_e19_c04_u046	Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
s01_e19_c04_u047	'Tonight' tonight?
s01_e19_c04_u048	Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
s01_e19_c04_u049	I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
s01_e19_c04_u050	Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
s01_e19_c04_u051	Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
s01_e19_c05_u052	Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs out in the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices the open door)
s01_e19_c05_u053	How could you lose him?
s01_e19_c05_u054	I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
s01_e19_c05_u055	Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
s01_e19_c05_u056	I don't know. The left one.
s01_e19_c05_u057	Which ones?
s01_e19_c05_u058	Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
s01_e19_c05_u059	(Entering) Hey.
s01_e19_c05_u060	Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
s01_e19_c05_u061	Rachel lost Marcel.
s01_e19_c05_u062	Oh no, how?
s01_e19_c05_u063	He- he pooped in my shoe.
s01_e19_c05_u064	Which one?
s01_e19_c05_u065	Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
s01_e19_c05_u066	No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
s01_e19_c05_u067	C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
s01_e19_c05_u068	Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
s01_e19_c05_u069	Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
s01_e19_c05_u070	Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
s01_e19_c05_u071	Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
s01_e19_c05_u072	Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
s01_e19_c05_u073	Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
s01_e19_c05_u074	Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
s01_e19_c05_u075	Whaddyou want?
s01_e19_c05_u076	Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
s01_e19_c05_u077	I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
s01_e19_c05_u078	No!
s01_e19_c05_u079	Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
s01_e19_c05_u080	I wasn't ready for it.
s01_e19_c05_u081	A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
s01_e19_c05_u082	Saw Regis Philbin once...
s01_e19_c05_u083	Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)
s01_e19_c05_u084	You owe me a waffle.
s01_e19_c05_u085	(On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
s01_e19_c05_u086	Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
s01_e19_c05_u087	Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
s01_e19_c05_u088	Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
s01_e19_c05_u089	Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
s01_e19_c05_u090	Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine) Well-
s01_e19_c05_u091	Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
s01_e19_c05_u092	Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine)
s01_e19_c05_u093	Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
s01_e19_c05_u094	Oh, what? What-what?
s01_e19_c05_u095	Y'know Marcel?
s01_e19_c05_u096	...Yeah?
s01_e19_c05_u097	Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
s01_e19_c06_u098	(Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
s01_e19_c06_u099	I know, I know, I'm sorry-
s01_e19_c06_u100	No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
s01_e19_c06_u101	(Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?
s01_e19_c06_u102	See? I've even called Animal Control!
s01_e19_c06_u103	You called Animal Control?
s01_e19_c06_u104	Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
s01_e19_c06_u105	Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
s01_e19_c06_u106	O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
s01_e19_c06_u107	That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
s01_e19_c06_u108	Hi, thanks for coming.
s01_e19_c06_u109	Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)
s01_e19_c06_u110	Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
s01_e19_c06_u111	Turned out it was a hat.
s01_e19_c06_u112	Cat!
s01_e19_c06_u113	Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
s01_e19_c06_u114	Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
s01_e19_c06_u115	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u116	My uncle Marcel.
s01_e19_c06_u117	Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
s01_e19_c06_u118	Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
s01_e19_c06_u119	Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
s01_e19_c06_u120	Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
s01_e19_c06_u121	Yes, but there isn't always time!
s01_e19_c06_u122	Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
s01_e19_c06_u123	Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
s01_e19_c06_u124	Yeah!
s01_e19_c06_u125	Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
s01_e19_c06_u126	Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
s01_e19_c06_u127	The Luisa from home room!
s01_e19_c06_u128	Yes!!
s01_e19_c06_u129	You have no idea who I am, do you.
s01_e19_c06_u130	No, none at all.
s01_e19_c06_u131	None.
s01_e19_c06_u132	Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
s01_e19_c06_u133	Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
s01_e19_c06_u134	Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (To Rachel) But you? What a bitch!
s01_e19_c06_u135	What?!
s01_e19_c06_u136	Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
s01_e19_c06_u137	I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)
s01_e19_c06_u138	Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
s01_e19_c06_u139	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u140	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u141	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u142	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u143	Hi, can I help you?
s01_e19_c06_u144	Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
s01_e19_c06_u145	A monkey.
s01_e19_c06_u146	Yes have you seen any?
s01_e19_c06_u147	No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
s01_e19_c06_u148	Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
s01_e19_c06_u149	Of course.
s01_e19_c06_u150	Oh. Then, no.
s01_e19_c06_u151	Did I put too much rum in here?
s01_e19_c06_u152	Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She starts to shut the door)
s01_e19_c06_u153	Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
s01_e19_c06_u154	Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
s01_e19_c06_u155	Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
s01_e19_c06_u156	We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
s01_e19_c06_u157	Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
s01_e19_c06_u158	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u159	Marcel?!
s01_e19_c06_u160	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u161	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u162	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u163	Oh-my-God!
s01_e19_c06_u164	Whaaat!
s01_e19_c06_u165	Something just brushed up against my right leg!
s01_e19_c06_u166	What is it?
s01_e19_c06_u167	Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
s01_e19_c06_u168	Look, Phoebe!
s01_e19_c06_u169	Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
s01_e19_c06_u170	Step aside, ladies! (She loads a gun)
s01_e19_c06_u171	What're you gonna do?
s01_e19_c06_u172	Just a small tranquiliser.
s01_e19_c06_u173	Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?
s01_e19_c06_u174	Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah.
s01_e19_c06_u175	Oh gosh.
s01_e19_c06_u176	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u177	Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u178	Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
s01_e19_c06_u179	Ross, you don't know that.
s01_e19_c06_u180	Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks a sign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
s01_e19_c06_u181	Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
s01_e19_c06_u182	Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
s01_e19_c06_u183	Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
s01_e19_c06_u184	Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
s01_e19_c06_u185	Ross.
s01_e19_c06_u186	I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
s01_e19_c06_u187	Ross.
s01_e19_c06_u188	Oh, forget it, okay?
s01_e19_c06_u189	Ross!
s01_e19_c06_u190	What? What?
s01_e19_c06_u191	Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
s01_e19_c06_u192	Hi, did you order some bananas?
s01_e19_c06_u193	What about it?
s01_e19_c06_u194	Gimme back my monkey.
s01_e19_c06_u195	I don't have a monkey.
s01_e19_c06_u196	Then what's with all the bananas?
s01_e19_c06_u197	Potassium.
s01_e19_c06_u198	Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
s01_e19_c06_u199	Marcel! What've you done to him?
s01_e19_c06_u200	That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
s01_e19_c06_u201	Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)
s01_e19_c06_u202	C'mere, Patti. (Marcel turns round)
s01_e19_c06_u203	C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)
s01_e19_c06_u204	C'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr. Heckles)
s01_e19_c06_u205	(Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha.
s01_e19_c06_u206	Okay, gimme my monkey back.
s01_e19_c06_u207	That's my monkey.
s01_e19_c06_u208	You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
s01_e19_c06_u209	That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
s01_e19_c06_u210	Alright, I want my monkey.
s01_e19_c06_u211	No!
s01_e19_c06_u212	Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
s01_e19_c06_u213	Sorry, prom queen.
s01_e19_c06_u214	(To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
s01_e19_c06_u215	Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
s01_e19_c06_u216	Nope.
s01_e19_c06_u217	Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
s01_e19_c07_u218	It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
s01_e19_c07_u219	Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
s01_e19_c07_u220	Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
s01_e19_c07_u221	Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
s01_e19_c07_u222	Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
s01_e19_c07_u223	That'd be good.
s01_e19_c07_u224	Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
s01_e19_c07_u225	Barry?!
s01_e19_c07_u226	We have got to start locking that door!
s01_e19_c08_u227	This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
s01_e19_c08_u228	Nope.
s01_e19_c08_u229	That's because I'm in front of them.
s01_e19_c08_u230	Eh. I thought that was an alp.
s01_e19_c08_u231	Well, high school was not my favourite time.
s01_e19_c08_u232	I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
s01_e19_c08_u233	Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
s01_e19_c08_u234	Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
s01_e19_c08_u235	Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! (She stands up and starts to dance around) Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
s05_e21_c01_u001	(To Phoebe) Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
s05_e21_c01_u002	I'm fine, thanks.
s05_e21_c01_u003	(To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
s05_e21_c01_u004	No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
s05_e21_c01_u005	Okay.
s05_e21_c01_u006	Hiya doin' pumpkin?
s05_e21_c01_u007	Nope. (Chandler nods in agreement.)
s05_e21_c01_u008	So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
s05_e21_c01_u009	I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
s05_e21_c01_u010	(shocked) Oh my God!
s05_e21_c01_u011	What do you, what do you think?
s05_e21_c01_u012	I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
s05_e21_c01_u013	Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
s05_e21_c01_u014	I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
s05_e21_c01_u015	(To Phoebe) I'll see you after work sweetie. (Kisses her.)
s05_e21_c01_u016	Okay. Bye!
s05_e21_c01_u017	So, what movie should we see?
s05_e21_c01_u018	(sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
s05_e21_c01_u019	What?! Really?!
s05_e21_c01_u020	He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
s05_e21_c01_u021	I can't believe this!
s05_e21_c01_u022	(terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
s05_e21_c01_u023	Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
s05_e21_c01_u024	Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)
s05_e21_c01_u025	No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
s05_e21_c01_u026	Ohhhh!
s05_e21_c01_u027	No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
s05_e21_c01_u028	So, what are you gonna do?
s05_e21_c01_u029	I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
s05_e21_c01_u030	Me?! Why me?
s05_e21_c01_u031	Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a-man!
s05_e21_c01_u032	I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
s05_e21_c01_u033	That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)
s05_e21_c01_u034	(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
s05_e21_c02_u035	Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?
s05_e21_c02_u036	Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
s05_e21_c02_u037	Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
s05_e21_c02_u038	(he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an island.
s05_e21_c02_u039	Hey, what time is it?
s05_e21_c02_u040	(looks at his watch) 2:17.
s05_e21_c02_u041	Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
s05_e21_c02_u042	Are you serious?!
s05_e21_c02_u043	Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
s05_e21_c02_u044	Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
s05_e21_c02_u045	Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
s05_e21_c02_u046	(entering) Hey, you guys
s05_e21_c02_u047	Hey!
s05_e21_c02_u048	Is Monica here?
s05_e21_c02_u049	All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
s05_e21_c02_u050	You bought Shawn Cassidy!
s05_e21_c02_u051	Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
s05_e21_c02_u052	Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross stares in shock.) Check it out!
s05_e21_c02_u053	What-what is it?!
s05_e21_c02_u054	What the hell is that?!!
s05_e21_c02_u055	It's a, it's a cat!
s05_e21_c02_u056	That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
s05_e21_c02_u057	Yes it is!
s05_e21_c02_u058	Why is it inside out?!
s05_e21_c02_u059	Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
s05_e21_c02_u060	How much did you pay for that?
s05_e21_c02_u061	Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
s05_e21_c02_u062	Yeah? How much?
s05_e21_c02_u063	A thousand bucks.
s05_e21_c02_u064	ON A CAT??!!!!
s05_e21_c02_u065	It's not a cat!
s05_e21_c02_u066	All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
s05_e21_c02_u067	Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
s05_e21_c02_u068	It's not a cat!
s05_e21_c02_u069	Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
s05_e21_c02_u070	(To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
s05_e21_c02_u071	Uhh, the ball thing.
s05_e21_c02_u072	Yeah?
s05_e21_c02_u073	Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
s05_e21_c02_u074	Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
s05_e21_c02_u075	Okay!
s05_e21_c02_u076	(catches the ball) Uh-oh.
s05_e21_c02_u077	What?
s05_e21_c02_u078	I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
s05_e21_c02_u079	Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
s05_e21_c02_u080	I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?
s05_e21_c03_u081	Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)
s05_e21_c03_u082	Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
s05_e21_c03_u083	Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
s05_e21_c03_u084	Yeah?
s05_e21_c03_u085	It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
s05_e21_c03_u086	(laughs, then suddenly serious) What's up?
s05_e21_c03_u087	Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
s05_e21_c03_u088	Sure. Okay.
s05_e21_c03_u089	Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
s05_e21_c03_u090	Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
s05_e21_c03_u091	You mean scared.
s05_e21_c03_u092	No, I mean happy.
s05_e21_c03_u093	Scared? Happy?
s05_e21_c03_u094	Chandler, what-what are you doing?
s05_e21_c03_u095	I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!
s05_e21_c03_u096	I know! I can't wait!
s05_e21_c03_u097	Were you're parents happy, or something?
s05_e21_c03_u098	Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.
s05_e21_c03_u099	Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
s05_e21_c03_u100	So you know what I'm talking about, right?
s05_e21_c03_u101	Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
s05_e21_c03_u102	No, it's too soon for you guys.
s05_e21_c03_u103	(pause) Yeah, you're right about that.
s05_e21_c04_u104	now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
s05_e21_c04_u105	Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
s05_e21_c04_u106	(entering) Hey guys!
s05_e21_c04_u107	Hi!
s05_e21_c04_u108	Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter) It was right here, where is it?
s05_e21_c04_u109	I don't know.
s05_e21_c04_u110	All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
s05_e21_c04_u111	How do you know? You don't have a watch.
s05_e21_c04_u112	Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
s05_e21_c04_u113	Oh, I don't know-. Yeah, can't do it.
s05_e21_c04_u114	What?!
s05_e21_c04_u115	Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
s05_e21_c04_u116	Yeah, we haven't dropped it in- (Looks to Ross.)
s05_e21_c04_u117	2 hours, 27 minutes.
s05_e21_c04_u118	Really?!
s05_e21_c04_u119	(on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up and keeps throwing the ball.)
s05_e21_c04_u120	Hey Rach!
s05_e21_c04_u121	Hey.
s05_e21_c04_u122	Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
s05_e21_c04_u123	Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
s05_e21_c04_u124	Rach?
s05_e21_c04_u125	Yeah?
s05_e21_c04_u126	You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are covered with scratches.)
s05_e21_c04_u127	Well, it's my cat.
s05_e21_c04_u128	(shocked) What?!
s05_e21_c04_u129	Oh yeah, I got a cat.
s05_e21_c04_u130	I don't want a cat!
s05_e21_c04_u131	Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
s05_e21_c04_u132	Yeah.
s05_e21_c04_u133	You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
s05_e21_c04_u134	Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
s05_e21_c04_u135	(To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
s05_e21_c04_u136	Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
s05_e21_c05_u137	Hi!
s05_e21_c05_u138	Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
s05_e21_c05_u139	Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
s05_e21_c05_u140	What?!
s05_e21_c05_u141	He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
s05_e21_c05_u142	You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
s05_e21_c05_u143	I'm sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
s05_e21_c05_u144	Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of here, good for nothing.
s05_e21_c05_u145	Hey Chandler.
s05_e21_c05_u146	Hey Gar!
s05_e21_c05_u147	(To Phoebe) Hi sweetie. (Kisses her.) Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
s05_e21_c05_u148	Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)
s05_e21_c05_u149	You look very pretty today.
s05_e21_c05_u150	Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)
s05_e21_c05_u151	Here's the thing.
s05_e21_c05_u152	Yeah?
s05_e21_c05_u153	Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
s05_e21_c05_u154	Uh-hmm.
s05_e21_c05_u155	Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
s05_e21_c05_u156	No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)
s05_e21_c05_u157	Phoebe?
s05_e21_c05_u158	Yeah?
s05_e21_c05_u159	I want you to move in with me.
s05_e21_c05_u160	That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
s05_e21_c05_u161	(disappointed) Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
s05_e21_c05_u162	I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
s05_e21_c05_u163	(disappointed more) Uh-huh.
s05_e21_c05_u164	I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
s05_e21_c05_u165	(on the verge of tears) Yeah.
s05_e21_c05_u166	Which is why my answer is yes!
s05_e21_c05_u167	(suddenly happy) Really?!
s05_e21_c05_u168	Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so-happy. (She's not happy.)
s05_e21_c06_u169	(catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
s05_e21_c06_u170	Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
s05_e21_c06_u171	That's right baby.
s05_e21_c06_u172	All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)
s05_e21_c06_u173	(jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
s05_e21_c06_u174	What?
s05_e21_c06_u175	He's a dropper!
s05_e21_c06_u176	Oh yeah, that's right!
s05_e21_c06_u177	I'm not a dropper!
s05_e21_c06_u178	It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
s05_e21_c06_u179	It's throwing and catching!
s05_e21_c06_u180	All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)
s05_e21_c06_u181	Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
s05_e21_c06_u182	Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
s05_e21_c06_u183	Oh my-Oh good God!
s05_e21_c06_u184	(she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
s05_e21_c06_u185	Baking it didn't help, huh?
s05_e21_c06_u186	So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
s05_e21_c06_u187	I tried! They won't take her back.
s05_e21_c06_u188	Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
s05_e21_c06_u189	Rach, why won't they take it back?
s05_e21_c06_u190	Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
s05_e21_c06_u191	Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
s05_e21_c06_u192	No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)
s05_e21_c06_u193	Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
s05_e21_c06_u194	Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
s05_e21_c06_u195	Hey!
s05_e21_c06_u196	We have great news!
s05_e21_c06_u197	We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
s05_e21_c06_u198	Congratulations! Congrats!
s05_e21_c06_u199	I know, I'm so excited!
s05_e21_c06_u200	So am I!
s05_e21_c06_u201	Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
s05_e21_c06_u202	Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
s05_e21_c06_u203	Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
s05_e21_c06_u204	All right.
s05_e21_c06_u205	So you're moving in with him. What happened?
s05_e21_c06_u206	I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
s05_e21_c06_u207	Why, do you write him a lot?
s05_e21_c06_u208	No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
s05_e21_c06_u209	Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
s05_e21_c06_u210	Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
s05_e21_c07_u211	Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
s05_e21_c07_u212	No, nothing.
s05_e21_c07_u213	Oh really?
s05_e21_c07_u214	Yeah.
s05_e21_c07_u215	Nothing at all?
s05_e21_c07_u216	No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)
s05_e21_c07_u217	Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
s05_e21_c07_u218	Uh-huh!
s05_e21_c07_u219	Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? (Closes the door and takes off his coat.)
s05_e21_c07_u220	(sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
s05_e21_c07_u221	So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?
s05_e21_c07_u222	Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?
s05_e21_c07_u223	In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?
s05_e21_c07_u224	Umm, yeah! Today's.
s05_e21_c07_u225	'Cause uh, this is today's Post (produces one from the other chair) and uh, these are the listings I found. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights!
s05_e21_c07_u226	(looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
s05_e21_c07_u227	Let me tell you what I think might be going on. (Phoebe looks down in shame.) No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she does so) Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?
s05_e21_c07_u228	Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)
s05_e21_c07_u229	Phoebe
s05_e21_c07_u230	Yeah?
s05_e21_c07_u231	Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.
s05_e21_c07_u232	That's so sweet.
s05_e21_c07_u233	Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just-I want you to be happy
s05_e21_c07_u234	Living with you would make me happy.
s05_e21_c07_u235	Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
s05_e21_c07_u236	No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
s05_e21_c07_u237	Are you sure?
s05_e21_c07_u238	Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in! (Hugs him.)
s05_e21_c07_u239	Oh that's great!
s05_e21_c07_u240	Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!
s05_e21_c08_u241	Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)
s05_e21_c08_u242	(looks into the box) Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
s05_e21_c08_u243	It's not a baby! It's a cat!
s05_e21_c08_u244	Eew! It's creepy looking!
s05_e21_c08_u245	Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! (Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?
s05_e21_c08_u246	(laughs) No, I hate cats.
s05_e21_c08_u247	Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
s05_e21_c08_u248	Wow! What an unusual cat!
s05_e21_c08_u249	Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
s05_e21_c08_u250	Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter (Good for her) but- Okay, why not?
s05_e21_c08_u251	Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
s05_e21_c08_u252	What?!
s05_e21_c08_u253	Okay, a thousand.
s05_e21_c08_u254	I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
s05_e21_c08_u255	Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
s05_e21_c08_u256	Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. (Starts to leave.)
s05_e21_c08_u257	(makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
s05_e21_c09_u258	I'm starving!
s05_e21_c09_u259	Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
s05_e21_c09_u260	I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented this game!
s05_e21_c09_u261	Please! I made this game what it is.
s05_e21_c09_u262	Not fun anymore?
s05_e21_c09_u263	I'm still hungry!
s05_e21_c09_u264	All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
s05_e21_c09_u265	I am!
s05_e21_c09_u266	All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.
s05_e21_c09_u267	Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
s05_e21_c09_u268	It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
s05_e21_c09_u269	Oh, thank God!
s05_e21_c09_u270	Did you get your money back?
s05_e21_c09_u271	Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
s05_e21_c09_u272	Wow! You made a profit!
s05_e21_c09_u273	(entering with the cat) I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
s05_e21_c09_u274	Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)
s05_e21_c09_u275	Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.
s05_e21_c09_u276	Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)
s05_e21_c09_u277	(To Ross) Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?
s05_e21_c10_u278	I really like waking up with you.
s05_e21_c10_u279	I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here all day.
s05_e21_c10_u280	That would be great!
s05_e21_c10_u281	We could have breakfast in bed
s05_e21_c10_u282	Wait, just a second.
s05_e21_c10_u283	Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.
s05_e21_c11_u284	All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!
s05_e21_c11_u285	(entering) Oh good, you're all up.
s05_e21_c11_u286	Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
s05_e21_c11_u287	Oh yeah, that's over.
s05_e21_c11_u288	What?!
s05_e21_c11_u289	Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
s05_e21_c11_u290	He shot a bird!
s05_e21_c11_u291	Oh that is over!
s05_e21_c11_u292	That's terrible! I'm sorry!
s05_e21_c11_u293	Phoebe, are you okay?
s05_e21_c11_u294	Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
s05_e21_c11_u295	Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)
s05_e21_c11_u296	(catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on the table and everyone gasps.)
s05_e21_c11_u297	It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
s05_e21_c11_u298	All right. Okay. I'm starving! (They all get up, thus officially ending the game.)
s05_e21_c11_u299	Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?
s05_e21_c11_u300	Yeah!
s05_e21_c11_u301	Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)
s05_e21_c11_u302	You guys wanna eat here?
s05_e21_c11_u303	Yeah! As long as we're here!
s05_e21_c12_u304	Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
s05_e21_c12_u305	Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
s05_e21_c12_u306	I know. My arm is killing me.
s05_e21_c12_u307	No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)
s05_e21_c12_u308	Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)
s07_e22_c01_u001	Hey!
s07_e22_c01_u002	Hey!
s07_e22_c01_u003	Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
s07_e22_c01_u004	Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
s07_e22_c01_u005	Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
s07_e22_c01_u006	It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
s07_e22_c01_u007	Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
s07_e22_c01_u008	(entering) Hey!
s07_e22_c01_u009	Hey!
s07_e22_c01_u010	Hey!
s07_e22_c01_u011	Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
s07_e22_c01_u012	(shocked) You let Joey drive it?!
s07_e22_c01_u013	I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
s07_e22_c01_u014	Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel" plan!
s07_e22_c01_u015	Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
s07_e22_c01_u016	Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)
s07_e22_c01_u017	Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding.
s07_e22_c01_u018	Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
s07_e22_c01_u019	Yeah, you got a couple hours?
s07_e22_c02_u020	Whew! That was a brisk ride!
s07_e22_c02_u021	Take the top down did ya?
s07_e22_c02_u022	Only way to fly.
s07_e22_c02_u023	Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
s07_e22_c02_u024	You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
s07_e22_c02_u025	Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
s07_e22_c02_u026	Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
s07_e22_c02_u027	I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
s07_e22_c02_u028	What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.
s07_e22_c02_u029	Gimme the keys!
s07_e22_c02_u030	No way!
s07_e22_c02_u031	Well no brush!
s07_e22_c02_u032	Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
s07_e22_c02_u033	(to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)
s07_e22_c03_u034	Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
s07_e22_c03_u035	Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
s07_e22_c03_u036	Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
s07_e22_c03_u037	I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
s07_e22_c03_u038	Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
s07_e22_c03_u039	Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
s07_e22_c03_u040	Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
s07_e22_c03_u041	Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
s07_e22_c03_u042	So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
s07_e22_c03_u043	Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)
s07_e22_c04_u044	Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!
s07_e22_c04_u045	My God!
s07_e22_c04_u046	What do you think you're doing?!
s07_e22_c04_u047	Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off of the hood.)
s07_e22_c04_u048	There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
s07_e22_c04_u049	Oh.
s07_e22_c04_u050	No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn't find it.)
s07_e22_c04_u051	Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!
s07_e22_c04_u052	With you?! Yeah right!
s07_e22_c04_u053	All right. (She starts off.)
s07_e22_c04_u054	(grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)
s07_e22_c04_u055	What are you doing?! Get in the front!
s07_e22_c04_u056	In the death seat?!!
s07_e22_c04_u057	Oh my
s07_e22_c05_u058	Hey guys!
s07_e22_c05_u059	Hey!
s07_e22_c05_u060	Hey sweetie!
s07_e22_c05_u061	Ready to go?
s07_e22_c05_u062	Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back. (She goes to get it.)
s07_e22_c05_u063	(stopping her) Wait a minute!
s07_e22_c05_u064	What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh. (Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)
s07_e22_c05_u065	So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
s07_e22_c05_u066	Over a month.
s07_e22_c05_u067	Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
s07_e22_c05_u068	Sure, I'd like that.
s07_e22_c05_u069	So uh, what's your name?
s07_e22_c05_u070	(laughs) Its Jake.
s07_e22_c05_u071	Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
s07_e22_c05_u072	Yeah, big fan.
s07_e22_c05_u073	Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
s07_e22_c05_u074	Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday. (He bends over to open his bag, when he does so his pants slide down his butt revealing a pink lace secret.)
s07_e22_c06_u075	Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)
s07_e22_c06_u076	What's this?
s07_e22_c06_u077	It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
s07_e22_c06_u078	Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! (Monica just looks at him.) We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
s07_e22_c06_u079	We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
s07_e22_c06_u080	Y'know we already went over this and I won!
s07_e22_c06_u081	No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
s07_e22_c06_u082	Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
s07_e22_c06_u083	Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know
s07_e22_c06_u084	No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
s07_e22_c06_u085	Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
s07_e22_c06_u086	He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
s07_e22_c06_u087	Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
s07_e22_c06_u088	Does it matter?!
s07_e22_c06_u089	Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding-you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
s07_e22_c06_u090	Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
s07_e22_c06_u091	Yes!
s07_e22_c06_u092	So I really never get to win anymore?
s07_e22_c06_u093	How much did ever really win before?
s07_e22_c07_u094	Pheebs!
s07_e22_c07_u095	Hey!
s07_e22_c07_u096	Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
s07_e22_c07_u097	Yeah!
s07_e22_c07_u098	Well, when Jake did it I saw that-he was wearing women's underwear!
s07_e22_c07_u099	I know. They were mine.
s07_e22_c07_u100	Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that's weird!
s07_e22_c07_u101	No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
s07_e22_c07_u102	That's weird!
s07_e22_c07_u103	I'm wearing his briefs right now.
s07_e22_c07_u104	That's-kinda hot.
s07_e22_c07_u105	I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
s07_e22_c07_u106	Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
s07_e22_c07_u107	And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
s07_e22_c07_u108	Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
s07_e22_c07_u109	There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
s07_e22_c07_u110	Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
s07_e22_c07_u111	I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
s07_e22_c07_u112	Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
s07_e22_c07_u113	Okay whatever.
s07_e22_c07_u114	You've seen my huge stack of porn right? (Phoebe nods.)
s07_e22_c08_u115	God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
s07_e22_c08_u116	(shocked) You don't have a valid driver's license-Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
s07_e22_c08_u117	Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax- (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)
s07_e22_c08_u118	(grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you-Okay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
s07_e22_c08_u119	I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
s07_e22_c08_u120	Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)
s07_e22_c08_u121	Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
s07_e22_c08_u122	Really? You think so?
s07_e22_c08_u123	I was talking to myself! You're going down!
s07_e22_c10_u124	(to Chandler and Monica) Has someone taken your order yet?
s07_e22_c10_u125	Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter) I'm-I'm sorry I'm new. I don't
s07_e22_c10_u126	(To Chandler) Hm-mmm?
s07_e22_c10_u127	Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)
s07_e22_c10_u128	You're straight. I get it. (Walks away.)
s07_e22_c10_u129	I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
s07_e22_c10_u130	No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
s07_e22_c10_u131	Why not?!
s07_e22_c10_u132	I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
s07_e22_c10_u133	What?!
s07_e22_c10_u134	Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.
s07_e22_c10_u135	Hello darlings.
s07_e22_c10_u136	And there's daddy!
s07_e22_c11_u137	Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!
s07_e22_c11_u138	Yeah, I'll get right on that.
s07_e22_c11_u139	Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under his leg.)
s07_e22_c11_u140	No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
s07_e22_c11_u141	(sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?
s07_e22_c11_u142	Oh my God.
s07_e22_c11_u143	Can I see your license please?
s07_e22_c11_u144	Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh-well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
s07_e22_c11_u145	Your license?
s07_e22_c11_u146	(handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.
s07_e22_c11_u147	That's Hanson.
s07_e22_c11_u148	Oops sorry, my mistake.
s07_e22_c11_u149	Dear Lord!!
s07_e22_c11_u150	Wow!
s07_e22_c11_u151	Here it comes.
s07_e22_c11_u152	This is a great picture.
s07_e22_c11_u153	Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed.
s07_e22_c11_u154	Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
s07_e22_c11_u155	Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
s07_e22_c11_u156	Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
s07_e22_c11_u157	Yes I am.
s07_e22_c11_u158	Yeah.
s07_e22_c11_u159	You're an Aquarius, huh?
s07_e22_c11_u160	I bet you're a Gemini.
s07_e22_c11_u161	Nope.
s07_e22_c11_u162	Taurus?
s07_e22_c11_u163	Nope.
s07_e22_c11_u164	Virgo?
s07_e22_c11_u165	Nope.
s07_e22_c11_u166	Sagittarius?
s07_e22_c11_u167	Yep.
s07_e22_c11_u168	I knew it! I knew it, ahh-.
s07_e22_c11_u169	Well I tell you what
s07_e22_c11_u170	Yeah?
s07_e22_c11_u171	You're not gonna speed anymore right?
s07_e22_c11_u172	I won't speed.
s07_e22_c11_u173	And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away?
s07_e22_c11_u174	I promise.
s07_e22_c11_u175	And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
s07_e22_c11_u176	Yeah!
s07_e22_c11_u177	Can he handle the stick?
s07_e22_c11_u178	Oh well
s07_e22_c11_u179	I can handle the stick!!
s07_e22_c12_u180	I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and-(She holds the mike out to the audience.)
s07_e22_c12_u181	Gay!
s07_e22_c12_u182	That can't be your father.
s07_e22_c12_u183	Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!
s07_e22_c12_u184	What?
s07_e22_c12_u185	That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
s07_e22_c12_u186	(singing) For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy! (Applause.) Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars. (He starts going into the audience.)
s07_e22_c12_u187	He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
s07_e22_c12_u188	Relax! You'll be fine. (Chandler exhales and turns off the table light.) Oh much better. You're invisible now.
s07_e22_c12_u189	(standing at a table and asking the guy sitting there) Where are you from?
s07_e22_c12_u190	Bakersfield.
s07_e22_c12_u191	I'm sorry? (Holds out the mike.)
s07_e22_c12_u192	Bakersfield!
s07_e22_c12_u193	No-no I heard! I'm just sorry.
s07_e22_c12_u194	It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
s07_e22_c12_u195	(to Chandler's back) Oh look, a standing ovation already! So early in the show. Oh turn around honey; let me see your pretty face. (He slowly turns around. Helena recognizes him.)
s07_e22_c12_u196	Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!
s07_e22_c13_u197	Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
s07_e22_c13_u198	Hey!
s07_e22_c13_u199	Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that he's got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!
s07_e22_c13_u200	Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
s07_e22_c13_u201	Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
s07_e22_c13_u202	Uh-huh.
s07_e22_c13_u203	The silk? Feels really good!
s07_e22_c13_u204	Huh.
s07_e22_c13_u205	Yeah! And-and things aren't as-smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
s07_e22_c13_u206	Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?
s07_e22_c13_u207	Hmm?
s07_e22_c13_u208	Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here- (He mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.) I should go take these off shouldn't I?
s07_e22_c13_u209	I think it's important that you do.
s07_e22_c14_u210	So what's your name?
s07_e22_c14_u211	(resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)
s07_e22_c14_u212	Chandler? What an unusual name! You must've had terribly fascinating parents.
s07_e22_c14_u213	Oh, they're a hoot.
s07_e22_c14_u214	(To Monica) And who is your friend?
s07_e22_c14_u215	I'm-I'm Monica.
s07_e22_c14_u216	Monica! Where are you from?
s07_e22_c14_u217	New York.
s07_e22_c14_u218	I'm not very fond of New York. Queens I like. (Noticing Monica's ring.) Ooh, what is this sparkle something! (Shows the audience who woos.) Honey! Huh?
s07_e22_c14_u219	Actually Monica and I are engaged.
s07_e22_c14_u220	Really?! Congratulations. When's the big day?
s07_e22_c14_u221	(looks at Chandler) In-in two weeks.
s07_e22_c14_u222	(disappointed) I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. (To a bald guy.) So you're bald?
s07_e22_c14_u223	Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
s07_e22_c14_u224	We? (Looks at Monica who nods.)
s07_e22_c14_u225	I know it would make me happy, ma'am.
s07_e22_c14_u226	Well I wouldn't miss it for the world. Oh! I'm getting all misty here! You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something. (Goes back on stage.)
s07_e22_c14_u227	(To Chandler) You okay?
s07_e22_c14_u228	Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
s07_e22_c14_u229	Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life- (Four guys wearing rubber boots, shorts, hats, and nothing else carrying umbrellas run onto the stage.) (Singing) It's raining men!
s07_e22_c14_u230	It's raining men!
s07_e22_c14_u231	(To Monica) When I was growing up I-played the one on the far left.
s07_e22_c15_u232	Remind me to introduce you to someone!
s07_e22_c15_u233	Who?
s07_e22_c15_u234	Fourth gear!!
s07_e22_c15_u235	What?! What does he want?! I wasn't doing anything!
s07_e22_c15_u236	Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
s07_e22_c15_u237	Maybe it's uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! (They pull over.)
s07_e22_c15_u238	It's a different guy!
s07_e22_c15_u239	Good evening officer.
s07_e22_c15_u240	Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
s07_e22_c15_u241	Ah no. I don't, but it could not have been more than sixty.
s07_e22_c15_u242	You're right. It was 37. (Rachel laughs.)
s07_e22_c15_u243	I mean you're not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
s07_e22_c15_u244	That's right.
s07_e22_c15_u245	Y'know of-officer I uh-I had the weirdest dream last night
s07_e22_c15_u246	Oh my God!
s07_e22_c15_u247	Your license please.
s07_e22_c15_u248	(laughs) You don't-you don't want to hear about my dream Officer-Pretty?
s07_e22_c15_u249	It's Petty. (He grabs Ross's license.) I'll be right back with your ticket. (Walks back to his car.)
s07_e22_c15_u250	(pause) You have a son!
s07_e22_c15_u251	I know. I know.
s07_e22_c16_u252	Feel better?
s07_e22_c16_u253	Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
s07_e22_c16_u254	Yeah, I understand.
s07_e22_c16_u255	Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and goes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!
s07_e22_c16_u256	Hi!
s07_e22_c16_u257	Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
s07_e22_c16_u258	I don't think so.
s07_e22_c16_u259	Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
s07_e22_c16_u260	Wow!
s07_e22_c16_u261	Yeah.
s07_e22_c16_u262	Really?!
s07_e22_c16_u263	Hm-mmm.
s07_e22_c16_u264	(to the woman) $4.50 please.
s07_e22_c16_u265	Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you.
